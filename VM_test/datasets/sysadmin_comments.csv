"From a guy that started in finance and moved to IT: the process is usually 1) the appropriate manager reviews all invoices that don't have an associated PO, or 2) there's a standing PO that finance balances the invoices against. No PO? No payment.  Amount doesn't match the PO?  Internal escalation to approve the invoice or adjust the PO.

"In my experience a TAM is an account manager with a clue. SAME role...but different knowledge. 

Having gone that route and went back to the industry I'm going to give you advice:

1. If a customer says no or doesn't want to buy...do NOT take it personally. Making a sale is as much luck as it is skill. This is the #1 reason I can't sell anything. I simply have a hard time with the rejection so sales isn't my gig. 
2. It's a numbers game. Watch Glengary Glenross. In short...ABC...Always Be Closing....every single person you talk to is a possible target for a sale. I know you're a TAM...and yet...who are they going to retain? The TAM that brings in business and the one that doesn't?  If you're a billable TAM things get easier.
3. As you aren't a part of the company the customer may be a 110% jerk-o and say you're terrible for no reason and you can get fired from the account. It happens. There are bad customers. As long as your organization understand that you'll be good. Don't take this personally if it happens once in a while. Talk to your job coach...you have one right?
4. Get a job coach and let them know you want to learn to sell/support/whatever. TAKE THEIR ADVICE! If you find out that you're a jerk...accept that and work to fix it. Look, being in sales and trying to be legit at the same time is hard. Use the resources that are available.

Or it would, it backupexec hadn't shat itself. Now the box had rebooted recently due to a surprise power outage and it took me and a miracle to make it run again (the CFO stopped crying and promised a steak lunch. I'm still waiting...) - it wouldn't survive another power cycle. So we have failed storage, failing hardware, failed backups... and because it was sensitive I wasn't allowed any access to manually back up the crucial data.

"I have to say I have noticed this exact thing in a number of techs that I have worked with before I was in management and now that I am I feel like I run into it all the time.

I was thankful for a reminder this was a different server and OS and to try a reboot by one of the owners at our company! I think sometimes as a tech especially when busier you can land up forgetting the simple things.

Recently I attended a webinar about mentoring rather than managing. As other have already said some people need a bit more hand holding and direction while others need less. Making sure that they have the right support in documentation or guiding their thought process rather than calling them out has helped me. I don't out right give them the answer but try to lead them to it. Prompting then to try and develop the critical thinking.

Lstly something I have observed is people who are not techs only tend to be better in this. Some one who has done some other line of work from farming, framing, sales, and debt collection.

"&gt; If you are in the CEO's spotlight, this is an opportunity not a danger!

I've had one too many times where a C-level has asked me, a non-manager, such things. It was professional inappropriate. I think it's telling that we, in this sub, don't hold C-levels to high standards and, instead, treat them as dumb users - incapable of knowing how to communicate or think without having their hand held.

&gt; Every good sysadmin should have a wishlist that can be pulled out in times like this.

This is the job of a manager. Not the SA.

The manager should have this off hand. That's *their damn job*. The SA on the other hand should be focused on, ya know, their actual job.

Look, I get it, if we want to be a hero - sure  - have it all, know it all, be fluent in social etiquette.. for what amounts to meh salary. The skills transfer and c-levels would be wise to know that these people absolutely will leave for greener pastures soon enough.

And c-levels rarely do. C-levels who need their hand held usually are too short sighted to recognize they need their hand held are also the ones you aren't going to have a nice conversation in the elevator with when they pull this.

So what you and the other person propose has a **very strong** tendency to lead to very bitter tech folks. You want to take the higher road of intelligence, beyond c-levels and managers, and when they ask such moronic questions, like OP's, you're left with the impression that you now have to arm-wrestle to keep your job much less actually make progress with funding and *get ahead*.

So no -- I'm going to suggest *against* your advice and suggest, instead, to redirect them to your manager as politely as you can. It's not your job. It's above and beyond **AND** it's highly unlikely you'll get rewarded for it and, worse, there's a reasonable chance you can fuck it up and make your own life worse.

If you're an SA -- your job is not to hand hold the c-level and justify your job. That's your bosses job. If your boss *is* the c-level then you should strongly reconsider where you are working ASAP.

Fewer things are as validating as hearing the stories of the c-levels who think they don't need that, or can hire people cheaper only to fuck shit up nine ways from Sunday.

Again, and finally, *it's not your job to justify yourself*.

"You can't get much easier than any generic column tool like Trello/ToDo. My read of your situation is you've grown to the point where project management is slowly sliding into cowboy territory (or might already be there).

if you're the decision maker, then you should be looking at some project management good practice guides. I am a huge fan of ITIL and that might be a starting point depending how large/complex your org's requirements are.

If you're not the decision maker then I would probably approach it by thinking about what your wants/desires are for tracking and managing projects, then do some market research to decide whether you need full-fat project management and tracking software, or just need to talk to the powers that be to explain why your current methods/procedures suck balls.",1649903216,sysadmin,Immediate_Weather_99,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2chv0/how_do_you_keep_your_it_projects_organized/i4ng20j/

"&gt; You have to somehow get a credential. Microsoft hasn't build a ""trust"" for things like SSH keys to a Microsoft credential. Something to be aware of.

I'm not quite sure I understand here. Is a ""microsoft credential"" different from a username/password combination somehow? After enabling SSH I'm able to log in remotely with both local and domain credentials. I'm also able to authenticate with SSH keys configured as described in [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement).

"&gt;But holy shit why do I always feel like I'm stopping my team from making really decisions that feel like they really haven't thought through the implications of?

Well, that's a pretty good sign that you're actually good manager material. I forget where I heard this quote, but I think it might apply here:

&gt;The goal of thinking is to stop thinking.

What that means is, the evolutionary cost of maintaining and using our brains is actually pretty high. Brains take a lot of calories and time to build and maintain, and for most of our evolution as as species, the purpose of the brain was to assess a situation, make a decision, and act. You're in the woods and you see a silhouette. Is it a predator, or prey, or nothing? Decide, act.

Well, most people continue to behave in that manner, and don't bother to spend very much time thinking about stuff which is of little interest to them. For what it's worth, I don't think people like you and I are any different in this regard. We're just interested in the work.

Lots of people autopilot their way through their jobs, and I can't even blame them. Not every job is fun, or interesting, or engaging, or challenging, and I personally feel lucky only to the extent that I bumbled my way into a line of work I find interesting and financially rewarding.

Part of your job as a manager, I might even argue the *most* important part of your job, is to communicate not just what is important to your team, but **WHY** it's important, and what the principles are which should guide their choices when they're undertaking their work.

Then again, based on your two examples, it just might mean you've got folks who may be a bit weak in their troubleshooting fundamentals. Just because you've been doing a job a long time does not necessarily mean you're any good at it, and going back to, ""The goal of thinking is not thinking"", there's definitely IT people I've worked with in the past and present who've been content to just kind of coast.",1649901576,sysadmin,DeadFyre,/r/sysadmin/comments/u30e0z/something_ive_noticed_since_becoming_manager/i4ncges/

"&gt; What does a police officer do all day? If there is no crime what are you paying them for?

This is a bad example. Crime has been on the decline since the 90s but per capita police spending has far exceeded the point where it has any statistically significant impact on crime. There's also the issue of Warren v. District of Columbia (1981) which found that police have no duty to actually prevent crime. Using this example, it actually proves the asshole CEO is correct in questioning what you do, even though we all know that there's _always_ work to be done.

The best response to this kind of question is not to get mad, but to instead identify areas where you are doing invisible but important work and to highlight them in detail every time the CEO asks this question.

Long hours is part of it and fires are a constant.   The good news is not every company runs like this and in some cases people do it to themselves.

Major implementations aim for Mondays. 

2. Learn to automate and code as much as possible.   I'm always shocked at how code I've used 2 years ago for one thing can easily be recycled into something else.   You'll work harder in the beginning but once you have the bull shit work automated you'll work less than 40 hours a week. 

Things to automate

1. Onboarding [account creation,  email account creation, security groups.

2. Last day [account disabling, email account archival,  forwarding mail to manager,  disabling access to other systems.

As you set your pathway of j-hooks, you are running pull string tied to a roll of electrical tape which allows you to throw the pull string to the next j-hook location.  Usually j-hook spacing about every 4ft ish.  You do want some line sag between hooks rather than super super tight.  8-10ft service loops at each drop in case of failure or wanting to move drop location.

depending on how many cables and drops will determine the size of your j-hook path.  bigger jobs usually you decide on main pathway of j-hooks and use 4in hooks on that path and then use 2in j-hooks off the main pathway to the individual drop locations.  Smaller jobs, 2in j-hooks throughout is just fine.

when you pull your cable, you pull new pull string with each pull, pulling furthest location 1st and working your way back towards mdf or idf.  guy at boxes does the cable numbering and attaches cables and fresh pull string using electrical tape, and other guy pulls the string. on tight corners to drop location...you may have to pull enough cable to floor, then someone goes to the drop...the box man goes to where you pulled all the cable to the floor and you pull to drop while other guy feeds.  rinse and repeat",1649900039,sysadmin,shagad3lic,/r/sysadmin/comments/u34xn9/cable_trays_vs_conduit_vs/i4n8yo8/

Leadership isn't about what you preach , it's what you tolerate. 

Any failings in your team is a direct reflection of you.  Having team members on staff that have to be watched over or handheld is on you, because you made that decision.  Mentor them up, move them to a smaller box that they can't fuck up, or do what you probably know needs to be done but haven't because you are newer to leadership.

Let members grow, so long as they are putting in the work and you are seeing the progress.   But based on those comments, there is no progress or receipt for success here, just dead weight for you and the rest of your team to get burnt out  carrying. 

Being a leader and the decisions we make suck sometimes, but keeping folks around that can't / won't are unable to improve is a real kick in the dick for the rest of your team that wants a team mate / peer but instead gets to baby sit.",1649891504,sysadmin,vNerdNeck,/r/sysadmin/comments/u30e0z/something_ive_noticed_since_becoming_manager/i4mpijn/

A highly skilled engineer has clearly massively over thought the problem and has deemed it to be something outlandish.

They discounted the easy fixes due to experience.

My point being, if you let the senior move region they would have during the process re-authed. And it would have fixed the issue. 

Making staff aware to think back to basics or check with peers is so imperative to being good at IT.

"Mh. At that scale - the best way to put it, you're asking me what to do if a chainsaw has buried into the leg of an employee and how to stabilize them best. The correct answer is to prevent them from putting a chainsaw in their leg. I do find it relatable, but strongly questionable that the currently public RCA is ""oh whoops, put the wrong IDs into a script"". 

But once the chainsaw has been blessed, it's tricky. One core problem to consider with larger data sets is just pure throughput. We can dump ~800mbit/s per archive node into a recovery node. A main cluster at my current employer has 2 primary different storages so we run 2 mirroring archive nodes in our critical systems, so we can feed both nodes in a case of emergency. However, due to the way our postgres backups work, a full restore is still going to take ~2 hours from empty systems, to fully functional systems. And there is nothing we can do about that, except paying obscene amounts of money for more network throughput. 

And this becomes worse with what seems to be their situation. I'm talking about full system wipes - your datacenter got transferred into a cloud of toxic gas by a fire and you have to rebuild everything. That's a simple case. In that case, a bunch of efficient systems are just dumping data onto each other at whatever pace the hardware gives them. Great stuff.

Atlassian currently has to extract individual tenant datasets from recovered databases as far as I can tell. That's magnitudes slower than a full restore, if you have vetted tools available. We have vetted tools around because I wrote them and the team honed them to work right. If you didn't have these tools available? Despair is a good plan.

And well, once you've survived that, you have your data available. Nothing is working yet.

So, wrapping backwards:

 - Being forced to restore is a failure already. Beyond a certain size, if there is a shred of doubt touching a large data set, find ways to test your change, and multi-eyeball every change. 
 - Being unable to restore can shutter the company. Studies have shown this to be of 90%+ probability.
 - Have a good, tested plan of how to execute restores, both fully and for whatever you required restore atomicity is. 
 - And be prepared to let your emotions flow because there is nothing more you can do after a certain point.",1649889295,sysadmin,Tetha,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2l7hh/pretty_interesting_read_about_atlassians_outage/i4mkh1i/

"May I give you some old timer advice?

First the story, cause us old timers like our stories.

""At a company I worked for there was this young man that was a very good SysAdmin.  Now he like his job, it paid well and he was able to work on almost any technology he wanted to.

One day he decided he wanted to get the certifications that would make his already vast experience ""legitimate"" in his eyes.

So off to school he went.

See, this workplace also had a continuing education plan that would have paid for the schooling if he passed his courses.  He decided against using this and quit his job somewhat suddenly.

He came back after 4 years looking for a job, now brandishing his new certs.

The job he had vacated was now looking for more than what he had for certifications, but knowing that he was a hard worker, they hired him back on.

He is now working int he same position, making the same money.  But now he has over $60,000 in student loans to pay off.""

Moral of the story, know what you have in front of you and ask yourself ""Is this enough for me, am I happy to do what I am doing.""

Realistically a job is not going to be the thing that gives you the most joy in life.  If you have a long hard day at work, it'll erode the passion you have for that joyous thing, slowly ad to the point where it no longer provides the same joy it once did.

Keep your passion and work separate.  Work should pay the bills with a little left over to save up and not take more time from you than you are willing to give.

I believe people throw around ""Work Life Balance"" without really knowing what it means.

I believe it means something different to everyone, but hinges on having your work life be different from your personal life.  You need a way to distinguish the two from each other.

"It's always hard, especially transitioning to manager in a company that you helped build and develop the infrastructure and processes for.

Everything just makes sense to you because you built it that way, or think a certain way, or are just more thorough than someone else.

&gt; So now certain members of my team I have to keep a closer eye on because I can't trust that they won't go off in the wrong direction.

I've found these situations to be the most difficult. You can't be spending all of your time monitoring your employees. That's a waste of your time, your salary, and it's just not good for them to be micromanaged either.

When I see things going down this path, I take a look at possible education opportunities. How can we improve their skills to a level that I'm comfortable they're doing their job well and within what we need. After that's been exhausted, and if it's still an issue, I have them work closely with someone else that I do trust. Bonus here is that you can also have conversations with that 3rd person to get their feelings on the ""problematic"" employee's skill levels. If it's still an issue after that, then it's probably time to move on.

&gt; there are members of my team where I have to literally write out every single step and nothing can be implied.

So these are great documentation opportunities. Especially your example. They missed steps that, in your mind (and mine TBH), should be common sense. Have these people document what they think the steps are and how to complete the task. Once that's finished, review it with them, and throw things out like ""Do you think we need a step to add the new server to the monitoring system?"". Or ""what else are we missing here?"". 

Make it a thought exercise on their end. It'll help them think things through a little more, it'll likely help them remember these steps the next time they do it, and now you have the bonus of completed documentation that can be referenced next time, so there is no confusion, and no excuses for missing something.",1649887791,sysadmin,RCTID1975,/r/sysadmin/comments/u30e0z/something_ive_noticed_since_becoming_manager/i4mgwce/

Triggered

I used to work at a place that was in need of replacing their primary firewalls. 5 to 6,000 daily users. Around 20,000 devices. I selected an option and advocated for it to the rest of the team. Management went for it because it was 1/10 of the cost of what we were considering getting instead.

I laid out an extremely cautious project plan where we set them up and power them up and route only a tiny subnet through them first. Then a slightly larger subnet. Then the it subnet. Then we gradually and carefully add one subnet at a time using the core router's routing table

This way we could very cautiously roll this out and have lots of time to assess potential problems along with a quick rollback plan if needed

Is that what ended up happening?

No. No it is not. Would end up happening is that our completely untested and unconfigured firewalls were yolo'd straight into production. They had them up for only about a week and had done basically zero testing and then hard cut everybody over to them on a Friday night.

Almost none of the firewall rules matched up with the old system. NAT was a mess. The UTM features were blocking everything because we hadn't taken time to run things in audit mode and scope exclusions. Eventually C levels got involved and asked what the hell is going on.

My plan and my solution both got chucked under the bus immediately. I was cut out of the meetings between the guys who implemented the solution and the higher-ups. I was simply informed a day later that we would be purchasing something that was 10 times the cost and paying an additional 10 times the cost over again for a consultant to come in and set it up.

It was an extravagantly wasteful experience

In IT the current is already obsolete and upgrades can be hard, these should be planned so they can be done at the best possible time, not when there is no other choice and you have to do it badly in a panic.

and there's the rub.

While the CTO may be willing to do this, because, let's face it, if you're going to insist that your peeps are certified (they're already 'certifiable' - they're SysAdmins ;) then they need to pony up the money **and** the time off to get it done.

From my (admittedly dim-distant) past experience, most cert's have a ""one week crash course"" and the exam on the last day after lunch - so it's possible to do it in one week, especially if you have practical experience in the product set.

Of course, the week 'off' means that there is more work for the rest of the team, although in a team of 4, there is a high likelihood that someone will be away for at least part of a month due to illness, family emergencies, annual leave, other...

"As a couple of the other answers said, the reason is because this isn't how DNS is designed to work. It's hierarchical up to the root DNS servers, and if the hierarchical query fails, the answer is `NXDOMAIN` - which is *not* an answer of, ""I dunno, maybe someone else does."" It's an answer of, ""this domain does not exist.""

It's a terminating error. `NXDOMAIN` and `HTTP 404` are similar types of errors.

When you receive a 404 from a webpage, the browser doesn't keep checking other paths or domains. 404 is a terminating error that says, ""what you want doesn't exist. Stop asking.""

If you want to ask a specific resolver about a host, typically the way that's handled in DNS is through a delegation and/or a conditional forwarder. You can forward specifically defined requests to other DNS servers, up to and including entire domains. Whether that's an acceptable solution usually depends on what you're doing with your split DNS.",1649880275,sysadmin,binaryvisions,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2vyud/dns_forward_if_nxdomain/i4ly0f0/
"Small Business IT is both a blessing and a curse. I love it myself, but there are some dangers of the trade. I have three big ones that I roughly categorize them into.

The first is, of course, IT-hostile leadership. If they don't value the IT department, you're better off just looking elsewhere, although I've also had some luck with encouraging these types to move over to MSPs. A lot of time their businesses do better when they have someone with dedicated sales experience to help them make the correct choices. Regardless, you're never gonna win here. Just aim for a graceful exit. 

Second are management styles that are sort of clique and hierarchical. If you don't mind (or even enjoy) playing office politics, you can thrive in these environments. Alternatively, IT also has such an information disparity compared to any silo'd department that it's usually not overly difficult to establish yourself as neutral/peacemaker territory because the various departmental cabals are afraid of tipping office status quos. If you're not willing or able to play the social game, you'll probably find this sort of atmosphere exasperating as you stumble blindly into little pockets of drama. 

The third groups are the nirvanas. After moving around, you finally find a place where IT either has already established itself as a core part of the business or the management views IT as a productivity multiplier rather than a cost sector. You walk into senior management with a proposal, they actively ask questions about what the benefits are to the company, whether it will require additional employee training time, on-going support costs and the like. And then you go home and while you might have to handle the occasional after hours call from the owner or one of the senior levels, for the most part there is an understanding that most issues can wait until the morning.

Before they authorize the change, like now, set the TTL for their DNS records to 5 minutes. That'll avoid issues with the changeover. Make sure you change them back once the change is made.

Unfortunately if I were to step into a manager role as a true ""leader"" most of my day would be spent dealing with budgets, POs, Legal trying to change every MSA that ever existed, and lets not forget office politics.  Fuck all that...hire someone to deal with that bullshit.  My motivations are building cool shit to achieve company goals and ensuring the people that work for me have the training and mentoring they need to be the best they can be.

My director has tried to get me to apply for open manager reqs in his org in the past and each time I told him no.  I have no problem with proposals, presentations, architectural diagrams, etc but I refuse to do paperwork and politics.

OpenSSH is still ""new"" to Windows.  While available pretty early on in 10, you not going to hear anything from Microsoft about the server side (though it is there).

The whole Windows Hello thing is a venture into the world of private/public key authentication in Windows.  So, who knows?  That might all be setup for something that better supports OpenSSH in the future.

I wholeheartedly agree. If a feature doesn't exist on a platform and I can force it to with some mod, then I likely will. If that mod breaks with every update, I try to no longer rely on it and just adapt to whatever the default features are.

Win11 is just not ready for prime-time as long as the right-click menu issue exists. It's almost like whoever spearheaded Win8 is sitting in the developer meetings, chiming in every now and then and the devs have to compromise with their stupid ideas.

In our business, I wonder how much accumulated time our employees would waste trying to navigate to update their SVN working copies in WIn11 only because MSFT wants the right-click to work their way, not ours.

"Haha, The simplest thing to do is setup a MAIN project and look over the workflows for / create if needed, these issue types

1. Bug (Something is broken or acting as it shouldn't be, however, it acn wait for the sprints to come around to fix)
2. Story (This is really a work request, but rather than allow the person asking for the work to dictate what the solution is, you document the problem and the new behavior they want, this is called a ""Story"" -- This issuetype is there so you can look at what problems and or lack of functionality you have going on, and you can prioritize as such. They often have many 'tasks' linked to them)
3. Task (Nothing is broken, but there is work to do and we know exactly what it is --- usualy these are attached to stories as part of an investigation or epics as part of a project)
4. Epics (These are your big projects, and an ""epic"" is the only issuetype that can act as a ""parent"" to other issues. Usually under an epic you'll have a few stories, and under those stories you'll have some tasks on how to address the stories, once all of that is finished, it'll mean that the business project has been completed)  


Once you have a list of epics, you just prioritize them and story point them. Story points serve as a measure of ""effort"" it takes to make the epic complete. 

Then you will have a list of possible projects (epics) that you can now rank by difficulty and potential positive impact on the business. Then you set a sprint timeline (usually 2 weeks for larger teams, 1 week for smaller teams) and you know how many ""Story points"" a team can run through in a week. So bugs take up a certain amount of story points, and so do tasks/story investigations. So now you can estimate work on a per-sprint basis and fit projects into timeframes!

"You may want to consider using SPMT to migrate from the share up to OneDrive in your batches.

Regardless, KFM sucks in that it will silently fail if there are problems with redirecting those three folders.  I ended up instead re-redirecting user folders underneath the provisioned OneDrive root and checking OneDriveCommercial being set and fetching the root folder (and validating it exists) from there, using item-level targeting to accomplish that via GPO.  I believe somebody janked together something using a new OneDriveSync var.. wasn't necessary but you do you.

Also helps to verify if OneDrive is ready to go for a user before all of this, I collect this via logon script.  Similar, I have collections for ""where"" the user folders (on a given machine..) are targeting their folders for reference.

As for the silent login, you'd have to check your hybrid join et al.. that would be different than any migration.

Back to the migration, indeed you'll need to either force the data back to local by modifying the current redirection policy to pull the files back and then ditch the policy.. there is a side-effect there that ""large"" and/or ""remote"" data will simply exasperate the user logon experience once they observe that policy change.. perhaps on the order of hours.  That's why I suggest possibly using SPMT to batch it up instead.  The files already live on your share, typically the speed is ""legit"" from that host to Microsoft, versus remote or downlevel connections for users.

Last, highly consider implementing a Storage Sense policy to keep local sync data at bay on the workstation.. else they'll likely fill up their own disks.

"There are absolutely limitations on how many logical databases you can get onto a single Aurora instance, largely because the highly-managed nature of it restricts you from being able to make certain configuration changes to the instances.

Our application provisions a single logical database per tenant (each database has hundreds of tables) and we started having major database issues after a certain point because Aurora was constantly swapping tables into and out of memory and queries would stall while it waited for the right tables to be in-memory (very very bad for performance). Mysql/Aurora needs a file handle for each table that it keeps in memory and at the OS level the number of maximum file handles is controlled by a kernel variable that cannot be modified in Aurora.

"If you hate it that much you could always revert to Windows 8.0 instead. 

Not to be confused with Windows 8.1 which was pretty terrible in itself but nowhere near as bad as 8.0 was as it was basically stable and could be used for most tasks after finding where they moved, buried, and hid basic system controls and interfaces.

Plus you have me wondering which MS Surface you have that the update process renders useless; some budget friendly i3 maybe and/or what bloatware and AV client you’ve loaded it down with?

I ask because my not even officially Windows 11 eligible 6th Gen Intel CPU junk box Dell mini PC that a friend gave me last year with a crashed OS hard drive and its’ original Pentium G processor now has a i7-6700T 35 Watt processor and basic Crucial BX sata ssd installed for Windows with the 8GB (2x4GB) total system ram (shared iGPU memory!) plus it did let me upgrade it from TPM 1.2 to TPM 2.0 firmware too.

This cheap old low power mini PC totally handles full screen 1080 YouTube videos and Netflix and web browsing and gmail and Amazon and eBay and whatever else I ask it to do simultaneously with my 50” 1080 TV as its’ primary monitor and it does all that over a little USB wifi dongle with wireless keyboard/mouse with no problem while Windows 11 is updating which it does on a regular basis even on this ineligible 6th generation Intel CPU system without skipping a beat.

I press the power button and I’m at the main screen in about 20 seconds from a full shutdown, not from suspend or sleep modes.

I click the mouse or press a key and get a login prompt.

I give it a password and I’m at a desktop ready to go in a few seconds or less even when it does decide that updates are available and it automatically begins getting and installing them.

Oh, and I installed Windows 10 on this little PC last summer after upgrading the CPU and replacing the bad hard drive with the SSD, I immediately benchmarked it after updating all drivers to have a performance reference for all its’ components when the Windows 10 installation process finished, then I signed it up for the MS Insiders program and got offered the Windows 11 Developers’ beta upgrade within about a minute after signing up which I clicked to “download and install”, and when that process completed (also in a fairly short time) this same PC actually benchmarked a little better overall on that Windows 11 beta version than it did on Windows 10.

Also note that when the Public Release launch happened last October Windows Update converted this little mini PC from the Dev Beta version to the general release version and has been updating it regularly ever since then even with an ineligible CPU and it runs just as well as it ever did on Windows 10!

It did run noticeably faster on Windows 7 than it did on Windows 10 but it is absolutely *not* any slower on Windows 11 than it was on Windows 10. 

It’s not a gaming system but it’s also not slow for daily use at all.

So maybe your MS Surface is in power saver mode and/or loading all sorts of unnecessary background apps on startup or there’s just something else wrong because between this low power i7-6700T CPU mini PC and my 4th Gen i7 desktop from 2014 (yes, 8 years old!) that I use daily which is also running the absolutely latest general release of Windows 11 the only way I even know it’s updating is after it finishes when it tells me I’m about to need to restart.

So either you’re truly overworking that particular Ms Surface or it’s in low power mode or something else is wrong because these old ineligible systems are booting in like 30 seconds, having me to a desktop ready to go 5-20 seconds later, and running Windows 11 just fine.

Granted neither is a tablet but that 6700T according to Intel *is* a 35 Watt CPU so kinda apples to apples there at least and I will admit that I’ve selected the “High Performance” power profile on both of them (but set the minimum cpu setting to 5%) and they both have decent sata SSD’s in them which helps considerably but still neither is a top notch gamer rig although the 8 year old one used to be 8 years ago…

Something else to check… your wifi…
Either that or plug it into Ethernet and see if that helps.
I could see where downloading updates while trying to also browse over wifi could make a system seem slow.

Good luck with your troubleshooting for determining why windows update appears to be rendering your tablet useless while it updates because based on my experiences so far with ineligible legacy hardware running the current release of Windows 11 that is not normal system behavior.",1649875661,sysadmin,Silver-Engineer4287,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2qppa/windows_11_is_garbage/i4lmnnt/

"The devs make the app work in the web server software, using data from the database - and in test, that works.  The DBAs keep the database online - and it is currently not offline, and not complaining about anything it doesn't usually complain about.

The sysadmin installs the web server role into the web server, and make sure it is running.  It's running, and there are no unusual alerts there being thrown by the server or application.

The network team has a firewall and load balancer - they're not blocking or dropping anything and it looks like traffic is flowing through them.

The Network people don't know how web servers work.  The Sysadmin doesn't know the nitty gritty about how the network stuff works (firewalls block or don't, load balancers load balance or don't), or how the Developers' code works.  The Devs don't know anything about the network at all, and don't really have access to, or a lot of troubleshooting knowledge about, the web server in Production which may or may not actually mirror the development/testing environments.

So when something breaks - where is the issue?  The app isn't complaining, the database isn't complaining, the web server isn't complaining, the network stuff looks just fine.

"&gt;  I feel Ansible, as shallow as it is, would be a decent candidate for that. Or is that done when you're standing up the host at start? And in that case, if you do need to make changes, how do you effect those changes at scale?

I'm really against ansible as I feel it's shallow and its features present a walled garden.  I prefer Chef and MgmtConfig; one for preferences and ease, and the other for sheer power.

But I was delivering (and updating) this kind of thing in 2001 through a combo of RPMs, RPM triggers, makefiles with sed and cron, to both deliver keys and software and configs and trigger changes immediately or periodically when things changed.  It worked well in a pre-puppet landscape.

In both cases, they'd be seeded by instantiation triggering an install and first-config from the config management; but you'll want to ultimately land the cron into something that's done by config-management and not orchestration so you don't get locked into a permanent setup for no reason.

To address the question, if ansible's the tool you already know, then definitely use that and don't look beyond it.  If it's not the tool you know, maybe the gaggle of fundamentals (triggers, makefiles, cron) will work well for your skillset and your CI/CD setup.  Otherwise learn mgmtconfig if you can swing it.

There is no mechanism in DNS that says ""well this resolver doesn't know, so I'll ask elsewhere"". It works on a ""well this resolver **didn't respond at all**, so I'll ask my secondary"" basis.

"I personally had this question a while back, tried a bunch of things, and ultimately landed on MDT/WDS.

As someone who's fresh out of college (even though we never went over MDT in college), I was pretty quick about figuring out how to use MDT to my full advantage.

I kept it basic with 2 task sequences;  
\- **Onsite (Citrix, Special Applications, Etc.)**  
\- **Offsite (Citrix, No Special Applications)**

I built them side by side, ensuring all dependencies were installed before the ""Install Apps"" sequence, and then added some customization to the image via powershell scripts.

I'd say it's pretty good, drastically increased our PC build time from 2+ hours to 15-30min. Before I was hired, apparently the company was building PCs by hand, installing windows from a thumbdrive (or, even worse, keeping the OEM image) and manually loading applications.

After a while, I even learned how to bundle features like .NET framework 3.5 and Windows Updates into my install media using a tool called ""[OSDBuilder](https://osdbuilder.osdeploy.com/)"", making end-user deployments even less of a pain. Windows'd be updated out of the box, and ready to go upon receipt of the device.

Recently, I also found that you can bundle drivers into the task sequence using the ""[total control](https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/116865-add-drivers-to-mdt-all-versions-total-control-method)"" method. Basically, you grab driver packages from your manufacturer, load them into MDT in it's respective folder and voila.

I also tacked on a special task sequence for these ""AiO Builds"" I started making and labeling it ""Beta-Branch"" so that I wouldn't accidentally deploy dirty builds to production devices.  


TL;DR: Use MDT combined with OSDBuilder and the ""Total Control"" method for drivers. 👍",1649871910,sysadmin,Jacobwitt,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2q06c/how_do_you_stage_user_pcs/i4lcsc3/

"When I do a USB drop as part of a pentest i typically use a payload that will entice the user to open/execute it, you dont need to rely on autorun because users will run the payload for you.

The free and easy way for you to to do something like this (with management approval) would be to create a payload with metasploit, empire, or poshC2, and then whitelist it through your AV. The reason that youd need to whitelist it is because those default payloads will always get caught/blocked, and if you dont have the time to figure out how to bypass your AV then you'd just want to whitelist it.

Then, depending on your org IT policies, make it enticing to the user. I typically will name the file something along the lines of:

1. pay\_raise.xlsx
2. annual\_employee\_review.xlsx
3. employee\_layoff\_schedule.pdf.exe

If your org allows macros then you can use an Office file for the payload. If your org doesnt display the file extension of files then use the .pdf.exe etc.

If users are actually picking up USBs and just plugging them in (like you stated in the OP) then i'd recommend looking into having a pentest done. As part of the pentest you should request a USB drop and also a phishing assessment, these tests will provide metrics and give you and your management insight as to what training should be provided to your users to make them aware of the potential risks to them and their org.",1649868985,sysadmin,ughisthisnametaken,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2sgs4/security_training_usb_drives/i4l54h0/

Lots of sysadmins who make complaints like this also push back on *any* suggestion that would help them like creating a shift log, tracking in Jira(or whatever you use) tickets, communicating effectively on risks and delays, or making the slightest effort to communicate to C-levels in the type of language they communicate in.  Or in other words, most sysadmins don't know how to leave their ego at the door.  You may think you have the hottest skillset in town, but guaranteed someone else is going to come in after you leave and look at a bunch of stuff you did and call it stupid because they have to pick up the pieces and fix it.

Or maybe the CEO is a piece of shit and just has a vendetta out against IT.

"I believe that the certs are largely a racket perpetrated by Cisco to make more money, similar to the ""educational licensing"" options of big software companies. I've seen engineers with CCNAs fail to do the most basic of switch configuration and troubleshooting, and I'm a bit biased as someone without a single certification to my name, but I've seen engineers like me absolutely crush it.

A certification is proof that you learned something, and could recall it under a certain set of conditions. It does not prove that you can translate that knowledge into the job function, and if you're ALREADY doing the job, there's no benefit to having it.

The easiest framing I've found for this problem is something along the lines of:

We have X amount of hours of work on &lt;list of projects&gt; split across Y employees every week for the next N weeks. Certification costs us Z hours per engineer. Which project would you like me to remove an engineer from for that time, and how would you like me to communicate the change in deliverable date to the relevant parties?

This will usually get them to backtrack just enough to get you out of doing it for now, and opens you up to scheduling it in the future, but it at least lets them know you have considered their idea and aren't just pushing back for no reason or an aversion to the concept, but have a real quantifiable reason for not thinking it's a good idea.",1649867130,sysadmin,overkillsd,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2s7ac/new_cto_was_hired_last_month_certifications_for/i4l06ik/

"Other suggestions such as the scream test or traffic monitoring are great.

And for anyone else seeing this wondering how else this should be done, as a best practice use DNS CNAMEs wherever possible. Even for databases, set up a CNAME for each individual database. Makes it much easier to migrate databases one at a time to a different server later.

CNAMEs can also eliminate the struggle in server naming. You could easily give servers unique dictionary word names instead of naming them by location/role which may no longer match if you expand a servers functionality. Instead you can easily have a server named ""GANDALF"" but set up a CNAME like [dc01.west.mydomain.com](https://dc01.west.mydomain.com), or have multiple CNAMEs pointing to the same server A record. Even if you have a single server running as the domain controller, email, websites, etc (just an example, hopefully no one is running other services on their DCs) make CNAMEs for each service just pointing to the same server:

[mail.mydomain.com](https://mail.mydomain.com) \- GANDALF

"Here's a quick and dirty list, but i definitely know that most/all of these are way easier said than done. I always try to make it clear during our reporting process that these things may sound very easy is implement, but they never are due to the unique situation in every environment.

&amp;#x200B;

Reduce the number Domain Admins within your environment. You dont need 70 DAs for 200 users.

DAs should ONLY logon to DCs.

Separate user accounts from priv accounts, i.e. dont use your server admin account as your daily driver

Change your service account passwords to looooong passwords or passphrases. 

Change your priv account passwords to loooong passwords or passphrases (use MFA if possible for all accounts, just remember that MFA doesnt prevent PTH)

Use LAPS (or similar tool)!!!!

DONT KEEP passwords.xlsx ANYWHERE! Do a quarterly audit of shares and user profiles for potential password files (we find password.txt/xlsx on most assessments that we do)

&amp;#x200B;

Also keep in mind to secure your companies High Value Asset (HVA). Domain Admin is obviously the holy grail, but an attacker may not even need DA to get what they want. Your HVA might be a DB of all your customer payment info, or a repo for your propriety software source code, or a voter registration DB. If all of your server admins have access to your HVA then gaining DA isnt even necessary.

Power Management options are a bit more in depth as you will need to set them manually on a PC and then export the data to read the values you'll need to apply.  
  
*powercfg -q &gt;c:\users\franka\poweroptins.txt  *

-SETACVALUEINDEX is for AC power  
-SETDCVALUEINDEX is for battery/dc  
  
You'll see a long list of GUIDs that correspond to the power categories and sub categories. The last 3-digit number is the preference setting. The trick is applying the power setting to the correct power management plan. When you install Windows from an ISO, usually it defaults to a standard power plan, but after chipset drivers are installed or you're using an OEM machine from maybe HP or Dell, you have to make sure the power options apply to the correct power plan's GUID or you get mixed results. The way I do this is capture the GUID of the current scheme being used (example sets the screen sleep timer at 45 minutes and applies that rule to the current power scheme in use:  
  
    $PlanGUID = (powercfg /getactivescheme)  
    $ScreenSleep = ""-SETACVALUEINDEX "" + $PlanGUID.SubString(19,36) + "" 7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99 3c0bc021-c8a8-4e07-a973-6b14cbcb2b7e 0x00000a8c""

Don't necessarily need to keep a detailed timesheet but even just a notepad that you update through the day as you take care of issues or take phone calls discussing it related issues so it can be referred back to. Not only is this helpful for yourself to keep track of your daily work but can be used to justify your position and pay and work to your advantage when arguing for a raise or pay at a new job.

I have ADHD so I write down my day anyhow because a lot of times conversations are in one ear and out another unless I write down the some sort of reminder I can refer back to. It's not any sort of short mid long term memory loss where information is just gone from my brain permanently. But rather that someone will ask me about a conversation we had the previous week and it takes getting some details to jog the memory. Once the connection is made then I can recall the conversation quite accurately. It's just that my brain moves from one thing to another and if the conversation doesn't matter in that instant then my brain files it away in some dark recess that isn't as easily retrievable as other people.

The flip side of it is I can pull up notes from years ago and recall conversations scarily accurate once the connection is made in my brain and my brain pulls the information out of that dark recess. But without those notes a lot of times I never even remembered that the conversation happened in the first place unless they give me some details to make the connection. Just complete emptiness.

"I have a story.  It isn´t a short one.

Circa 2005, I landed as the one and only sysadmin of a small company that manufactured frozen vegetables. You know, collecting, sorting, washing, packaging, freezing and storing. 3 or 4 production lines, half of them 24/7 most of the time, a huge cold storage facility, plus two office locations in other cities. My nostrils still remember that fragrance of rotten food in the factory. 

The place was defaulting, I think that´s the English term. Their debt had grown enough to have some federal auditors taking control of payments. The salary was meager and the former IT guy was dropping the mic within days. It looked very bad from the outside but I was doing bad at the time (not as bad as now, though) and needed the job.


Short story long: it was worse from the inside. It really was.


The server was a crappy outdated homemade PC. A single underpowered PC. No redundancy, no domain, no updates, no fucking-windows-licence. Every computer was different and worse than the previous. No user policies or anything resembling that. The network was hilarious... FastEthernet was the fast half, the other was a wireless proprietary network pre-802 to serve the computers of 4 forklifts in the huge sub-zero storage area. The forklift's OS was a variant Win3.11 for workgroups. Yep, no WinCE, that was before bloody CE.


The previous guy stayed two days to show the place and left. On the side, he told me loud and clear that the place was a clusterfuck. 


The next week the ""server"" hard drive died. There was only a backup of the ERP database. That´s all, not even a printed list of users.

It goes on and on and on. It was a mess times two, without a single decent device to start with. I had been ripped of a lot of stuff from the last sysadmin while being scammed by the comms providers and the ERP/software partner (former outsourced IT service, you know the kind).


I could go for ages, but a few months later I had it sorted. Proper budget redundant servers, proper redundant storage, and backup, some early Cloud stuff (those sweet free early Google business accounts), a cheap setup with esxi for the small stuff, fixed licensing, arranged printing leasing, doing some programs in basic to help the workers with the bloody excels on the production lines, renegotiated all communications and service contracts, placed a few racks, cleaned the network doing the wiring myself and moved from crazy expensive mpls links to other sites to my own ones with pfsense or something like that, all while supporting users and the 24/7 shifts on production, dealing with industrial machinery, bag printers, rs422 stuff, the bloody wireless network and whatever mix of obsolete crap working there.


When all was settled, after sweating shit and blood, the fucking thing was rock solid in my field(s). That was a well-oilded engine purring like a cat and the ITC department monthly expenses had gone down amounting to way more than my salary. I literally did that.


So, do you know what happened then?... yep. Sure you do. 



The CEO had to have some words with me.
- ""you cannot be doing nothing"". If you want to stay with us you need to start doing administrative work in other areas.


Less than a month later I landed a company where I stayed for a decade, and 6 months from my leave the company started closing for good. 
Three years after closure, I was contacted by the CFO that was working for the auditors to liquidate the assets to retrieve some information from the ERP. The servers, NAS, and the whole thing on the headquarters were still working rock solid. It overlasted the company.


So yeah. I know it is the standard answer here, but I´d suggest start looking for a place where they know how to appreciate your job by its results. You´ll be happier.",1649863826,sysadmin,Josepsp,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2pr07/ceo_has_recently_started_in_with_what_do_you_do/i4krl5f/

1. Disaster recovery is frequently focused on the “worst case” scenario: “our entire business is a smoking crater in the ground and we need to restore the lot”.

And if your data structures and backup/restore processes don’t account for this, it’s very easy to wind up in a position where you’re only partially hosed - but it’s a lot harder to recover from.

"We have a more lax variety of machines so creating images isn't always helpful.

I use Atera so what I did is create a domain join script once a machine joins AD it runs Atera installer. Once Atera is installed it runs a bunch of scripts that auto install most commonly needed apps (Adobe, Cisco VPN, Office, Etc.). Then once I ""move"" that machine to a group within Atera that group has more scripts to install specific software needed by that department. 

What I like about this is if someone leaves for example from Estimating department. If I move that machine to another department it auto installs the software the next person will need from say Accounting. Still trying to figure out how to integrate printer scripts to install all company printers and I will be set. This also includes the remote monitoring portion too so I can remote to each machine. 

Bonus I have finely tuned other scripts based on hardware types

"Thing is you have incomplete requirements.  IE:

1. Will these 4 different clients have access to world wide web?  
2. Standalone Special Functions Systems? 
3. Does the client have security requirements or allow third party package managers?
4. Budget
5. Is anything cloud out of the question?  
6. hardware/software requirements (drivers kind of are important when capturing image as it is key in the task sequence 

&amp;#x200B;

Anything from creating a windows image with all the settings/policies etc in vanilla form then running something like chocolatey/ninite or manually scripting my own package manager in which the loop will run thru sections like hw drivers where you simply run a query to detect hardware and as long as it is one of the options you coded in it will loop thru installing the drivers as you can even script it to log you back in as admin after reboot.  You can even turn the uac on/off through the process but package managers are much easier.   If just needing to update without sccm you or a networked medium you can simply add in your code to reapply all the security/system specific settings to reapply after the loop of detecting software version and it either seeing if the right version is installed or move on to the next software.  Clearly you would order your code to install the Bios/EUFI partitions, secureboot config(if any), wim/os/drivers then applications and settings. (keep clean install baseline separate from the update package of course that way you can incrementally update whenever they decide to pay you if that is how that world works. 

You can even get ghetto with creating like Acronis or whatever they have out to capture your image per hardware/client type.    Some laptops can become servers so if you want to create your own Fog/wds or cheap image capturing solution and bring portable smaller sized tier II switch with some cables to launch multiple at the time that works too.  Do not forget that some Microsoft updates are almost like new image so need to keep that in mind.

Perhaps if several apps are already hosted with 365 you can maintain via the cloud at camp couch.  

If you already have SCCM setup somewhere like on a super specc'd laptop or mini pc then you can just create .iso's of the full creation of task sequence to install all drivers/settings/etc and send the .iso's to the site if you dont want to it yourself physically.

There are so many ways to go about it but too many unknowns to really decide how to go about it.  How much are they paying me again? 

If all offline then yeah a portal SCCM virtual machine on like vmware workstation/hyper-v on my beefy laptop or putting that mac m1 chip to work.  Maybe a small nuc or mac mini for a host for like a small dev/qa environment to sort of test everything but the drivers of course. Can still use USB/ethernet adapters to connect to the additional host offline if that host is even needed.

1. Implement and use MS Teams or  Slack. Use it exclusively to communicate your work. It will give your micro manager visibility into what you do. They don't understand any of it but they will not want to hear all of those notifications and ask to be removed.
2. Have a stand up meeting in the mornings and invite them to it. Don't allow them to direct it in any way. What did you do yesterday? What are you doing today? Do you have any obstacles?

"I had a LOT of clients on spanning for 365 backup.  It was a quiet product, set and forget like a good backup should be.  I was able to setup a tenant easily with a trial add a credit card and get a subscription with no human interaction an in a matter of minutes.

Kaseya enters the chat.

Had to buy from a reseller/partner

Couldn't change license counts on the fly.

Pain in the ass to change credit card numbers all of a sudden; has to be done by ""customer service"" and I use that term loosely.

Things get quiet for a while...ok, I can deal with this.

Kaseya turns me over to collections, says I haven't paid for 2 years.  Oh ok, that's weird.  Here's the receipts and emails from you confirming you charged me.

Months go by and I need to restore something.  I'm locked out of the portal.  Contact them with a WTF?  They said I'm in collections.  Lather rinse repeat the receipts.

A month passes before I can get back in.  They screwed up.  Legacy system they said.  No apology though.

Over the course of a year, this same scenario happened with 4 of my other clients; all played out the exact same way.

I started a plan to roll all business away from them and followed their as-posted instructions on cancelling/notification/etc.  Not one confirm from them that they received so I started spamming them with emails and read receipts to CYA.

One of them, they went ahead and charged the customer anyway and 5 months later through multiple contacts with Kaseya, they still haven't refunded the money.  It's always an excuse that they need some internal signature.  I've had multiple ""new account reps"" call me in that time frame and every single one of them tried to own the problem and after a couple weeks of saying they're making progress, they go dark.  Customer finally gave up and did a chargeback and there's a window where the vendor can fight it, we're in that window.  The emails of backups occurring are still coming.  

It'll be fun though, that client is an attorney.

As I've expressed to kaseya reps multiple times; they've damaged my reputation to my clients and I have no recourse with them.  There is no way in hell I'll use any of their products from this point forward even if they paid me and provided the products to the customer for free.  I don't care if we get 10 years down the road and they're a class leader; they're dead to me.  I am happy to relay my experiences to anyone that asks though; I'm not a big enough fish to hurt their pocketbook on my own, but at least it'll give others pause on partnering up with them in any respect.",1649857894,sysadmin,sandrews1313,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2p3mc/barracuda_acquired_by_investment_firm/i4kcss6/

It wasn't uncommon for us to get 20-100 computers to image and deploy at a time. Order would come in, we would image them, box em up and ship them out. Essentially company gets PCs, unbox and set down ready to go. This was a mid sized company started by a guy with his drinking buddies that he hired. Kevin total waste of space he was essentially a VP of shipping and logistics. Everyone knew he was the owners friend, spent all day talking to his other friends about sports on the phone, in his office loudly all day everyday. Anyway i guess someone said something to him about what he does and that must of pissed him off. So he calls all of us over and starts in on dumb sh\*t he has no idea about. So he looks at me directly and says what do you even do here??? I said, ""really? what i do all day? i would love to talk on the phone all day about sports but i take orders in from the sales guys, stage and box them when they are ready, on top of that i also work with Cliff supporting our IT infrastructure here at the office.

"Despite OP claiming that it covers ""Migrate scripts from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph"", that section boils down to ""Admins need to upgrade their scripts manually. Admins must find the equivalent Microsoft Graph cmdlets for the Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets to convert their scripts.""

Full text of blog post is as follows

**Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK**
You can install Microsoft.Graph module by running the below cmdlet in Windows PowerShell. 

    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser 

It will install the module for the currently logged-in user profile. If you want to install it for all the users, you must run the following cmdlet by opening Windows PowerShell in admin mode. 

    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope AllUsers 

Installing Microsoft.Graph module installs 38 sub-modules. To get a list of available modules, you can use the Find-Module cmdlet. 

    Find-Module Microsoft.Graph.* 
 
After installation, you can check the version of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module by using the following cmdlet. 

    Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph 

**How to Connect to Microsoft Graph PowerShell**

*Connect to Microsoft Graph – Things to Know:*
While connecting to Microsoft Graph PowerShell, you need to determine the 2 important things. 

* API Version 
* Required Scope 
* API version: By default, the module uses a stable version of the API. If you want to explore new features, you can use the beta version using the ‘Select-MgProfile’ cmdlet. 

    Select-MgProfile –Name “beta” 

Scope: Microsoft Graph provides access to all APIs in Microsoft 365. Each API is protected by one or more permission scopes. The user connecting to Microsoft Graph PowerShell must consent to one of the required scopes. For example, to view all the Microsoft 365 users, you need the ‘User.Read.All’ permission. 

Finding the required scope is challenging. You can refer to the [Microsoft doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) to determine the required scope. 

*Connect to Microsoft Graph:*
The ‘Connect-MgGraph’ cmdlet allows you to connect to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. You will need to sign in with an admin account to consent to the required scopes. 

    Connect-MgGraph –Scopes “User.Read.All” 

If you want to connect to Microsoft Graph with multiple scopes, you can provide them as comma- separated values. 

    Connect-MgGraph –Scopes “User.Read.All”,”Group.ReadWrite.All” 

Some scopes require you to grant permission on behalf of your organization. Once you connect successfully, you will receive a “Welcome to Microsoft Graph!” message. 

**Automatically Install and Connect to Microsoft Graph:**

This PowerShell script will automatically install Microsoft.Graph module (if not installed already) upon your confirmation. After installation, it will prompt you to connect to Microsoft Graph. 

Script Download: ConnectMgGraph.ps1

You can execute the script using the following format. 

.\ConnectMgGraph.ps1

  Connect-MgGraph

Microsoft graph keeps encrypted token and refreshes it automatically. So, the session remains open for a long time. If you want to connect to a different tenant, you can run the script with the –CreateSession parameter. 

.\ConnectMgGraph.ps1 -CreateSession 
 
**View Microsoft Graph PowerShell Commands:**

When migrating to a new PowerShell module, it is challenging to find the right cmdlets. For example, to view all the Azure AD users, you need to use the ‘Get-MgUser’ cmdlet. To easily find the required cmdlets, you can follow the below tips.  

To view Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets for a specific module, run the following cmdlet.  

    Get-Command -Module Microsoft.Graph.Users 

It will list all the cmdlets related to Azure AD users.  

![Screenshot of ""Get-Command"" output](https://m365scripts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/view-Microsoft-graph-PowerShell-commands.png)

**view Microsoft graph PowerShell commands**

As earlier said, you can use Find-Module Microsoft.Graph.* to view the list of modules.  

To view all the Microsoft Graph cmdlets, execute the following cmdlet.  

    Get-Command -Module Microsoft.Graph.*  
  
**Migrate from Azure AD PowerShell to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK**

As Microsoft is retiring the Azure AD and MSOL module at the end of 2022, admins need to upgrade their current Azure AD scripts. There is no native tool available to convert Azure AD scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Admins need to upgrade their scripts manually.  

Admins must find the equivalent Microsoft Graph cmdlets for the Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets to convert their scripts. For example, the equivalent of the Get-AzureADUser cmdlet is Get-MgUser. 

**Disconnect Microsoft Graph PowerShell**

The Microsoft Graph session lasts until you disconnect it. It keeps an encrypted token cache and refreshes it automatically. So, you won’t encounter the ‘Session time out’ error, unlike other PowerShell modules.  

To connect to another tenant, you must disconnect the Microsoft Graph session using the following cmdlet. 

    Disconnect-MgGraph  

To avoid using an earlier token cache, you can connect to Microsoft Graph using ‘TenantId’ as below. 

    Connect–MgGraph –TenantId &lt;TenantId&gt; 
 
**Update and Uninstall Microsoft Graph SDK PowerShell:**

To update the SDK, you can use the following cmdlet. 

    Update-Module Microsoft.Graph 
 
If you want to uninstall the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module, you must uninstall the main module first. And then all its dependency modules.  

    Uninstall-Module Microsoft.Graph 
    Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph.* | %{ if($_.Name -ne ""Microsoft.Graph.Authentication""){ Uninstall-Module $_.Name } }  
    Uninstall-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication 
 
I hope this blog will help you connect to Microsoft Graph PowerShell successfully. We will see how we can do some basic data retrieval using the Microsoft Graph SDK module in our next blog.

Everyone seems to be looking for senior developers with rockstar skills that can crank out the newest features while looking slick. Good development takes time to try out ideas and work as a team to refactor them into maintainable code. Nowhere in any of the interviews I've had do people ask the kind of questions I do when hiring.

"There's not much information to go on here, but generally, you'd want to make sure of:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Changing the IP information for the WAN interface. This will restore general internet connectivity. If your router defines the ISP default gateway outside of the interface config you'll need to update your default route for the new ISP's gateway.
2. Update address objects for VIPs, WAN interfaces (if applicable) and such so that port forwards, static NAT and 1:1 NATs point to the correct addresses on WAN.
3. Are they making internal services available on the public internet? Do they use a VPN to tunnel into the office? External DNS may need to be updated to reflect IP address changes for those external services. VPN clients on end user devices, if not using DNS to hit the VPN, will all need to be updated to reflect the new IP.
4. Ensure that the new ISP's CPE is set to bridge mode! Disable the internal WiFi, firewall, and any other unnecessary services on the new CPE if applicable.  Set one of the new ISP's static IP addresses on a spare router, or the LAN interface on your laptop. Test that traffic flows. I can't count the number of times I've walked into a place with a new ISP installed, to find out that it plain didn't work and I needed to make further calls and yell at the ISP to fix before cutting over. I'd recommend testing at least the first usable, and last usable addresses to ensure you have your entire address range available. I've also seen many times that the IP config we were given wasn't what we asked for, and the range was cut short. You want to know this before cutover day.
5. ??? Everyone's environment is different. Without more information, it'd be difficult to make further recommendations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at their existing router/firewall config thoroughly to see what they're doing now and make a change list, step by step, as detailed as possible for once the new ISP has been installed. Make a backup of the existing router/firewall config before making any changes. If the old ISP will still be present for a time, you can revert the config, reconnect old ISP and take a bit more time to regroup, find the issue(s) with your new config and take another crack at it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd highly recommend having the old ISP available along with the new for at least a week. Make your changes during non-business hours, and have a plan for testing everything you've discovered.

If we have a P1 which is caused by upstream networking, we get told to put a ticket in and wait. No. If we have a P1 that's your fault, I'm going to be bashing your ear on the phone until you fix your shit.

Oh, and don't get me started on last minute change requests. ""Hey. we're putting a CR for a switch upgrade tonight at 1am. Can one of your guys be on site to make sure that comes up?""

"I've been doing InfoSec in one way or another for about 20 years now. I'm to the point in my career where I have developed a methodology for protecting organizations by focusing almost exclusively on how attacks work and using basic security hygiene practices to defend against them. I have a mindset of ""use what you have, purchase as a last resort"" which has served me very well. I also have a mindset of compliance is the enemy of security and common security controls are the controls that your advisories are aware of and know how to get around.

I have a pretty good track record of shutting down pen testers and red teamers. I get a huge amount of joy from watching people who attack organizations for a living run up against a defensive control that they've never seen before and become impressed. This is really what drives me every day.

In my opinion InfoSec is not hard to implement, but it requires the right people. I've seen orgs where ""security is everyone's job"" which translates to security is nobody's job as the sysadmin and developer teams are far too busy with their regular jobs. On the flip side, I've seen orgs where the InfoSec team is made up of people who have only ever worked in InfoSec and have no idea what it is like to be a sysadmin or dev. It leaves them either making unreasonable requests that foster hatred amongst the groups or being ignorant of all of the fantastic, basic built in security levers that they could be pulling while they instead focus on boilerplate compliance rubbish and 6 figure SIEMs and EDRs... Y'know the things that every org has and therefore every attacker expects and knows how to get around.

All of this is why I started my Security Cadence posts. I just wanted to share the sort of crap I do that I've seen attackers get stonewalled by time and time again. 15 posts in (with 2 more sitting in drafts) and I continue to make recommendations that don't cost a dime, but I rarely see implemented in practice.",1649849732,sysadmin,snorkel42,/r/sysadmin/comments/u29ys9/does_anyone_actually_do_security_well/i4jwjqq/

"* Excellent learning opportunity = this is a 6-8 week contract, solve this problem for us so we can give you the axe asap

* Full-time, contract = we're giving you a contract and want you to work 8 hours a day, but we know people won't apply unless we incorrectly categorize it as full-time

Just my experience during the pandemic. Many emails from employers on ZipRecruiter and Indeed, sending me JDs that end up being some kind of contract situation without any benefits. My favorites are the ones that require onsite work, in a state that's 500-1000 miles away, and it not only pays less than my current job but it's a very short term contract offer.

Part of me wonders if they read over the resume at all, I know a lot of these are shotgun emails trying to hit as many names as possible hoping one will bite. In that case, I know they're not, but in other cases it's like I've never worked 1099, I have my preferences to full-time only, and I said no to relocation.

I wonder if anyone else has a similar experience with the pandemic recently. A lot of places want to eliminate work from home, they're offering very bad pay rates on short term deals, it feels like you'd be the leveraging chip against the full time employees that don't want to come back to the office.

"One of our entities got hit with Ransomware a couple of years ago. I didn't have anything to do with the repair and recovery, but they did recover after about a week of downtime and it was only possible due to solid policies on backups and storage that prevented the ransomware from infecting it.

Since then, the entire organization has had ransomware insurance. Let me tell you, that first questionnaire I filled out for the insurance company was painful. The entity I was working at back then complied with most of the necessities for coverage. A year ago I was promoted and acquired the corporate office. Someone up above hated me that week or karma came full circle as I got hit with their renewal questionnaire two weeks after inheriting this new environment to which the previous guy of 14 years had almost no documentation of anything. I spent the better part of the next two weeks documenting and scouring their systems, security policies, and despite having an impressive reading document that made them sound like they were safeguarding launch control at a nuclear missile silo, much of it was not implemented at all.

So I answered everything honestly and the insurance came back with a denial to insure because MFA was not rolled out organization wide and there were users with domain and global admin permissions (which they should not have had) and passwords set to never expire. I had a back and forth with a senior exec that was quite unpleasant because I refused to modify the document to get approved without first fixing the deficient items.

"You've pretty much got it exactly backwards.

When your computer does a DNS lookup it asks your DNS server (in this case googles) to resolve www.yourdomain.com.

Googles DNS server asks the root servers who is authoritive for com. The root servers tell Googles DNS servers the IP address of the DNS servers for com and so Google's DNS servers go and ask them who is authoritive for yourdomain, they respond with, in your case easly.uk's name servers IP addresses. Google's DNS servers then go and ask easly.uk's DNS server what the IP is for the www host record which returns the IP address to your website, that is then passed back to your client and your browser now knows what IP address to connect too.

Now some further info here. Every DNS record has a TTL (Time to live). Each time google was asking for an authoritative server or a record googles DNS servers cache that record for as long as the TTL indicates. This cuts down on the amount of times DNS servers need to query other DNS servers because they already have a lot in cache locally.

This is why you may not be able to resolve www.yourdomain.com but someone else may be able too even if the authoritative server for your domain is offline. Because they DNS server may have the record in cache still since it's been less than the TTL time since they last retrieved it.

This is somewhat simplified and glosses over a lot of configurations that may alter the above behaviour, but that's basically DNS in a nutshell",1649834867,sysadmin,WendoNZ,/r/sysadmin/comments/u230fm/help_easlyuks_vanished_and_sos_my_resources_site/i4jdqxa/

"It's known as payroll in arrears vs payroll in current.  Most orgs that I've worked with choose arrears as it allows payroll to operate more regularily and with less labor at scale, What you are paying today was settled 4 weeks ago, so there's less change that will happen in payments and almost zero potential for clawbacks due to overpayment mistakes.  

In most cases employee equipment damage in a company owned workplace is not compensable as mistakes happen and those are the employer's fault, but if they decide to get into a ragemonkey mode and throw their laptop or cellphone across the office and you have written testimony and documentation, then it would be compensable.  For employee's on the road or people working from home, they are most assuredly compensable.  I've had several gigs even 10+ years ago where we hired remote and sent desktops, monitors and keyboards to people's homes and an equipment damage contract with payroll in arrears was always part of the agreement.  Someone's 3 year old shoves a PB&amp;J Sammich into the fan port of a computer to feed it, they pay to fix it.

There are other places this gets used, e.g. for service employee's who are given a regular stripend under a tool purchasing program to purchase their own tools such as roadside mechanics or manufacturing maintenance staff or for employee's who check tooling in and out.  Sometimes you get a meathead that likes to use their drill as a hammer or just wants to break equipment for no good reason.

"Wasn't CoreSite, was it? 

Great support throughout the years hosting there, however the exit process seemed smooth but turned out to be incredibly miserable for both us and a tenant we were hosting in a separate rack. 

Gave our 90 day notice since they wouldn't budge on pricing and we would literally save nearly 50% moving to another local colo. New colo even offered to include professional rack and equipment migration to the new colo. 

Went through the sign out process. Documented every equipment that was pulled. Went in on a Monday to review the move out with one of the NOC guys and verify everything moved out. Signed off on some paperwork saying we've completely vacated everything. 

3 weeks later, hit with another bill including the price increase. No big deal, probably just a mistake on their part. Call up support, get transfered around. Old account manager says she'll look into it and get it taken care of. 

Radio silence for another 2 weeks after that. Heads were down and focused on another project. Kind of forgot about this issue. Hit with a late notice right around this 2 week mark. Called account manager back up, she informed us we didn't completely vacate the racks and this negated out 90 day notice. She sent a picture with 2 cat 6 cables hanging from the patch panel in each rack. Same ISP/colo patch cables that were there in 2015 when we initially moved in. 

They weren't budging. Kept sending late notices and threatened to cut service. Alright, go for it. Nothing is there. Not going to affect us either way. 

They kept pushing. Attempted to go to creditors. Claimed they disabled switch uplink on their NOC side and got generally shitty all around.

"Here's what you need to know about linux shell:

* When you open a terminal, you are executing a binary called ""bash."" Bash is a fork of Sh. It has more features. There are other forks of sh. Ash is probably the most popular; it's the standard in busybox, which is heavily used in embedded/containers.  There are also more powerful/modern shells, like zsh and fish. SH/ASH/BASH are ""POSIX-Compatible,"" meaning scripts and commands that meet the POSIX specification will work in all three. ZSH/FISH are not POSIX compatible, so while \_most\_ of the functionality is similar, it's not guaranteed to be.
* Inside the bash shell itself is where concepts like environmental variables, loops, globbing, etc exist, however, it's most commonly used to launch other utilities. When you type 'ls,' you're running a different binary which lists files. Typically, knowing the ""linux shell"" means knowing bash + all the standard POSIX binaries. These almost always live in the /bin directory.
* When you write a bash script, you prefix it with a shebang-line, which reads #!/bin/bash -- this tells the shell which binary will interpret/run the script when you launch it without specifying a program.
* Bash scripts are literally just that - self contained bash environments - any command you can type into a script, you can also type into the terminal. Any command in the terminal can be a line in the script. They are 1:1 parity.
* Environmental variables are stored as $VAR\_NAME and can be read with echo $VAR\_NAME.
* The shell will only execute commands that are stored in the folders listed in $PATH. echo $PATH
* The two ways to execute a bash script are by running chmod +x script\_name.sh (making it executable) or by running bash -c script\_name.sh, which passes the script name as an argument.

- You start at the bottom again, learning their systems, their processes, doco, personalities, etc. Even as a senior role.

- You get a great opportunity to reinvent yourself, but you have to be consistent and forward thinking.

So you're telling the CEO he/she has an expected incident spend of $600,000 to $1,200,000 over the next 10 years (cost times likelihood) or they can hire 1-2 FTEs and spend some additional money on hardware and software.

"Personally, I think there's a sweet spot, where the company's size, complexity, budget, and available tooling all intersect. One that stands out to me in particular was a credit union with locations in IN and TX (amongst others). 

Another was a large bank - you absolutely know them by name because they've had a big breach and advertise heavily. Yes, they're huge, but their security spend is astonishing. It's not perfect security. It's just a level of defense in depth I've never seen anywhere else.

I think the trend is that in those orgs, they didn't treat compliance as the standard. Sure, it was a consideration, but they did security for security's sake, with a proportional level of resources directed to security - and most importantly, significant leadership support for doing that all the way up to the CEO and board.

A lot of orga stumble over their own org structure. Security says ""hey VP of manufacturing, you have to update that EoL database to something that's in support."" And the VP of manufacturing says ""fuck you, make me,"" and security can't. They have no pull to get it done. But at these orgs? That VP of manufacturing gets hauled in front of the executive leadership to explain himself.

"The fastest and most common ways are:

1. We poison the network using Responder which allows us to collect NTLMv2 hashes - if one of those hashes belongs to a DA and we are able to crack that hash then its over.
2. Kerberoasting an spn which has DA rights and cracking that hash.
3. Using ntlmrelayx in conjunction with Responder allows us to relay an auth attempt against boxes that dont have smb signing enabled, this will us to dump the local admin hash and then we can spray that hash against all targets on the network and it will work unless the pw is different on workstations due to using LAPS (this is not usually the case). From there we have admin/SYSTEM on every workstation so we find where the DA is logged in and either use mimikatz to get their ntlm hash or simply inject into a process that the DA owns, we are now DA.
4. Lateral movement due to misconfigurations or a failure to realize the risk of certain actions within AD, example: we phish a user (that shouldnt have any elevated access because theyre just a typical paper pusher) and land on their box, they have local admin to a different box so we move laterally, the person logged into box 2 is a server admin and has local admin to EXCH01, a DA is logged into EXCH01 so now we're DA.

I have seen a fair share of people who know enough how to run a Nessus or Rapid7 scan, but don't recognize the weaknesses of their tools. Meanwhile I have discovered that when I updated some of my Catalyst switches a while back that low and behold now there are **far** more than 16 vty lines and if you open enough sessions you overflow to line that don't have an ACL on them. Did our ""infosec"" department discover this? Nope. Did they give us crap about not patching an issue for a feature that we don't have enabled? Why of course. Sure, the code I'm running is vulnerable to the latest HTTP management bug, but HTTP has been disabled on our switches for years specifically because we don't use it and we know there will be another HTTP/S bug in another 6-9 months assuming there aren't a couple zero days they haven't even discovered. Worse yet, I have some devices where they can't figure out why the vulnerability scanner doesn't know what version of software the device is running so they're asking us to patch issues we resolved from a change window months ago. What's comical is that meanwhile they're ""managing"" firewalls that are months behind the vendor recommended release. Even some of the other managers kinda bite their tongue at the hypocrisy that every other department needs to fix bugs even if they are to disabled features, but the firewalls they ""manage""... meh?

"While I think it is kind of hard to “self-eval” on this topic since “you don’t know what you don’t know”, I do feel like the org I’m at does a pretty good job with security.  There is a dedicated team of ~ 6 security engineers whose job is to monitor/maintain our security posture as an org.  We’re a public research institute that serves researchers from across the country so there are some additional challenges that come from mostly operating in the Science DMZ model (a lot less use of firewall appliances than I’m guessing most are used to, instead use tap-aggregation on our multiple 100Gb WAN connections to monitor traffic and “black hole” IP addresses when needed if flow analysis notices something it doesn’t like), but I think we handle those well.  Mandatory use of host based firewalls that are regularly audited, overlapping service config limitations to protect if host firewall has an issue, etc.  Since most of our users are scientists/grad students/etc. from across the country that we rarely meet, the concept of “zero trust” when it comes to users is pretty well baked in which I think is naturally different from how many corporate entities work which I think has worked in our favor.

Systems are Qualys scanned weekly (with log-in capability to check package versions), all machines in production networks zones forward all logs to central log analysis where they’re run through a bunch of pattern matching checks, all SSH login is behind 2FA bastion hosts, etc.  We’re a 99.8% Linux shop and while we do operate some one-off services for customers our main exposure is SSH and HTTPS for web-based portals/user tools so our attack surface is fairly low (no Windows boxes, printers, ancient appliances, etc. thankfully).  All things like vSphere access, DNS config tooling, monitoring systems, etc. are behind a 2FA Cisco VPN.

Machines are to be patched rebooted at least once every 90 days (many follow a 30 day cadence) and of course when critical vulnerabilities are announced by vendors there is an emergency patching process that gets executed (feel like there have been more of these recently).  Lastly there are weekly meetings between the security team and the ops teams where prior scan results are discussed and vetting of new systems is also discussed; all new systems going into prod IP space need vetting sign off first.

All that to say though, there are still some gaps that I think that we are steadily trying to close.  One of our environments has to meet SOC 2 requirements as well as a few other certifications that I can’t remember off the top of my head, but a lot of the feedback we get on those audits ends up getting extrapolated as a “lessons learned” for our other environments where/if applicable.  The trouble is though obviously that it only takes one small slip up somewhere for there to be an issue and when operating tens of thousands of servers there is a lot of room for slip ups.  A key I feel like though is to limit the “blast radius” as much as possible, keeping a malicious entity from lateral movement within an environment can truly be the make or break in some of these situations.",1649807707,sysadmin,jdphoto77,/r/sysadmin/comments/u29ys9/does_anyone_actually_do_security_well/i4hyddv/

"You don't understand.  The entire point of ACME is automatic renewals.  If you are manually distributing the certs you are doing it wrong.  You also might be interested in the following:

[https://github.com/grindsa/acme2certifier](https://github.com/grindsa/acme2certifier)

This is an ACME to ADCS proxy.  Here is another one:

[https://github.com/glatzert/ACME-Server-ACDS](https://github.com/glatzert/ACME-Server-ACDS)

If you want a commercial one Keyon makes true-Xtender that also supports ADCS to ACME.

I encourage you to read about and learn about automatic certificate renewal protocols.  You appear to have blinders on that only Microsoft does useful stuff.  The ACME protocol is getting far more installs these days than ACDS and more people are asking MS when are they going to dump ACDS and replace it with ACME for certificate distribution.

Essentially by running your own CA you are duplicating cloud infrastructure that does the same thing.

The OP is small.  If he wants, the quickest way for him to setup an internal CA would be to load Windows Server Essentials Experience on his DC.  That will bring the CA role in with a bunch of other Really Useful things to a small org.  Then he can learn all about the joys of creating and distributing your own root cert and decide whether it's worth doing or if it's easier to just use public certs that don't require MDM platforms or anything else of that nature.

"As a former k12sysadmin now in government, school environments are actually a pretty good environment, particularly surrounding the cyclical yearly schedule of terms/semesters.  Start of school year can be stressful to finalise big projects and PC rollouts, but overall once you have done a year or two in a school you will appreciate a change of pace that comes in school holidays.  Often you don’t have think about being on call 24/7 or dealing with that many after hours, but this may be different depending on what the expectations are for the school (I was in schools about 7 years ago)

One of the biggest challenges you will come across in schools is that budgets can be quite tight, IT teams have just enough capacity to support the school when they don’t have people in the team on leave etc, there is little buffer when this happens and members in the team will be proficient in the job as IT generalists.  Sometime the sysadmin will be the IT helpdesk as well as the IT manager….it may be a greater load and responsibility when working in enterprise where some IT roles are siloed.

If I had questions to ask going into a school sysadmin role:
- can they clarify out of hours expectations or what generally expect in terms of business continuity? 
- how do they size their team to meet the expectations of the school? Do they allow for top up with MSP or external support?
- do they offer PD to IT staff to keep up skilled and relevant to technology supporting the school?",1649805119,sysadmin,Peter-GGG,/r/sysadmin/comments/u2a28p/an_interview_tomorrow/i4hsd4i/

In the azure sign-in logs, add more columns and you'll see more interesting stuff like the Primary Refresh Token auth methods etc.

If they have no interactive logins, it means what it sounds like. They may be doing no work (ha) and just have their computer connecting to Azure or, more likely, they could be using M365 apps on the computer with a long session interval like 30 days. 

So you won't see actual sign-ins, just PRT logins with the ""login requirement already satisfied"" (paraphrasing).

Other folks may be using SSO apps, [office.com](https://office.com) web apps etc that this user just doesn't use and they stick to just outlook and teams on the laptop with a 30 day session token so they rarely log in interactively.

If you fwd to logs into a Log Analytics workspace you can use much more sophisticated logic to search for login events which may come in handy.

"I am lucky to be working, and have worked for the past seven years, at places that take security seriously.  However, I have encountered places that still consider security a joke, and still say, ""security has no ROI"".

There are tons of companies out there, all wanting full-stack developers who will include anything and everything, none of them wanting any security.  I talked with a few acquaintances of mine over the weekend, and learned about a few:

*  One company has zero interest in defending against ransomware because they believe ""their users are too sophisticated enough to have it happen"", and that backups are more expensive than paying the ransom.

*  Another company finds that anyone in security is considered a ""party pooper"", sort of like the teacher's pet who bangs an object against the wall when the teacher starts to speak.

*  One guy got fired because all his DB code did checksumming on row insertion/modification.  The PM was mad that the guy spent time ensuring integrity of a production backend database, instead of just getting new features that marketing wants.  The PM wanted the AES key for table encryption to be all zeroes, so the PM could crow about having ""encryption"", but not have to worry about key management.

*  Another company considered an InfoSec background a black mark, because it meant that the person with the background would consider something other than getting deliverables into the PM as soon as possible.

One would think this would change, but for a lot of places, even small/midsize startups, the top brass really have nothing to lose if there is a ransomware or even a data wiping attack like NotPetYa.  They either get their golden parachutes and leave the mess for the VCs, or if the company has public stock, would be able to short their stock before making the announcement that things are in shambles.

"Few rules:
* come prepared with a salary range you would like to be paid (say now you are at 59k, you maybe want between 72k and 87k).
* make a list, and it needs to have a lot of things on it, with other benefit: extra day off, bonuses, shares, better medical cover, life insurance, a new title, more responsibility, training, certifications  etc. etc.
* A set of words/vocabulary that will help you negociate, soecifically shades of approuval /disaprouval. So you can say stuff I may take X, but I might take Y if you can also do Z.

The plan:
* Ask for a package, can your boss compare 5k vs 5days off and a better health care vs life insurance, 1 extra day off and a quarterly bonus if 10k? I doubt.
* Always keep the conversation going. If it stops, try to get it going by changing the package.
* Use your voccabulary /set of words to indicate where your range is, think 'will' vs 'might' vs 'would consider'. You need to exoress agreement and disagreement. 
* if you cannot get the conversation going or an agreement, book another conversation for the following week or ASAP (you boss might need to talk to his boss /hr) 

Extra tips:
* Lots of benefits come fron HRs budget: insurances, health benefits, learning materials, shares. It cost your boss nothing to his budget, it might need more time to get approuval tho
* The more prepared, the easier the conversation, rehearse with a mate/partner/mirror (still use the words you preoared out loud).
* get that on a piece of paper, bring it with you (dont give/show it to you boss)

"For stock or options trading (options really) this reminds me of about 3 weeks ago

Okta had a bad hack and it was making the rounds in Reddit, Hacker News, etc for days. Not much happened on the Stock Market while it was big here. Then news hit the stock market and the stock tanked in one day. 

If someone had shorted the stock they could have made 30% return in one day (not worth the risk if you ask me) but if someone had bet against it using Stock Options (kind of likely gamboling on the stock market) then they made 2000% to 3000% in on day.

I was well aware of the issue but didn't think to play it. Luckily this news is not impacting the stock yet (ticker $TEAM) - so at market open I bought some stock options (PUTS) to bet that it will go down by 4/22. I'm up 50% for the day but that is not the goal. No major financial sites even cover it last I looked yesterday and today. If this news is considered big enough to make financial news and the stock market acks unfavorably in the short term then I can easily make 100%'s to 1000%+ percent. If not and the stock goes up I lose all my money (on that one trade).

"You're using Invoke-Command to run stuff on remote machines, where do you want the output file? 

If you're happy making it output locally on each endpoint, you can do something like:

    Invoke-Command -computername $computername -scriptblock {
    $log = [System.Collections.Generic.List[System.Object]]::new()
        try {
            choco install $program -y
            $log.add(""Installation of $program successful"")
        } catch {
            $log.add(Installation of $program failed"")
        }
        $log | Out-File ""C:\temp\chocologfile.txt""
}    

Which is fine, but a bit of a pain to troubleshoot if you have tons of machines. If, on the other hand, you want it to write back to the machine you're running the Invoke- from, you'll want to add a *return* to your scriptblock:

    $log = [System.Collections.Generic.List[System.Object]]::new()
    $install = Invoke-Command -computername $computername -scriptblock {
    try {
        choco install $program -y
        $output = ""Installation of $program successful on $computername""
    } catch {
        $output = ""Installation of $program failed on $computername""
    }
    return $output
}
    $log.add($install)
    $log | Out-File ""C:\temp\chocologfile.txt""

"I personally think it went well, but, it didn't solve all the problems. 

The psychological aspect I felt helped as people started caring more about the equipment and there was less ""accidental"" damage or theft reported.  

As far as the specs on a laptop, there was a caveat to the program...our company provided a recommended hardware list that they had to buy from. There were several different options (at least 3 as a minimum) for laptops were typically Dell, Lenovo, or some other mfg'r that was reputable and someone could order from. If the employee had something else in mind, a review of the hardware was required prior to approval. So, the employee would purchase the device outright, either have it shipped to the office or they would bring it in, we would then configure it and send them back to work.  Accounting would then either cut a one-time check or incrementally credit the value in their bi-weekly payroll (most of the time it was a single check). From there on we provided support as needed as if it were out own device. When/If the employee was terminated/resigns we would do a factory wipe and send them with the device.

Now, the issue was like you said...what happens in the event of an true accidental break? Well, that's when we would pull out older laptops and recycle them down. At that point, they got what they got.

Ultimately, there are times where we couldn't just can't get around having to provide equipment outright...some folks are financially strapped, or require something immediate. We had to deal with it on a case by case basis.

We also used this same kind of system for mobile phones. We would just offer a monthly credit of like $20-30 bucks for them to use their personal cellphones or for them to handle it as they wanted (like using a PAYG mobile phone).

For the record, the company that acquired the one I was working for has since scrapped this program.  I also cannot say this would work for a larger business/enterprise.",1649797964,sysadmin,punk0mi,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1i7m4/personal_hygiene_work_from_home/i4hcny9/

"My friend got a job at a local restaurant around 3 years ago where the owners said they treat their staff like family. I was getting major red flags from it and he was getting paid minimum wage + had a very flexible on-call schedule. I told him he could easily find some place better and that everything about the restaurant was suspicious 

Well he kept the job and I was proven wrong. This owner actually does treat their employees like family. All the staff are close to each other and the owner invites them to a big party every quarter. My friend gets thousands of dollars in bonus every year and has a much higher 401k match than my company. He also gets a ton of credits towards hobbies, others get their tuition paid for. One of the manager who’s been working with the family for over 20 years got a down payment. Another manager got 5k as a wedding gift. At the end of the day, my friend probably makes around the same amount as me + a far better working environment .

First off, you could literally say this istead of using dumb buzzwords. But lets break it down even more:

&gt;gets tasks done accurately and completely

This is literally a pointless phrase. Nobody is going to be like ""oh I guess I shouldnt apply because I lack the ability to do tasks accurately and completely"".

&gt;without significant oversight

This is an actual detail of the job, so it is worth including. I would simply say ""hands-off management"", ""works well independently"", "" or something like that.



Stepping back a little bit, Id like to ask: what is the point of information in a job posting? I would say it is to let people know if they should apply. Anything that doesn't directly help with that decision is literally just filler.

"Man so many things to consider. The size of the environment,domain trusts, logging. There is a good article https://argonsys.com/microsoft-cloud/library/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/ 

Personally i began buy setting up a logging server to forward dc logs with 0x17 to a central server then parse the logs, 0x17 which is RC4 authentication. if you have splunk or anything else consuming DC security logs you can use that to parse as well. 

This will give you an overview of devices using RC4 and you can begin to see what devices are using it. For me it was mostly cross domain chatter, storage arrays, old SQL server service accounts, that havent had their password changed ever. you may need to reset the krbtgt password in AD. There is a whole other article on doing this. Take it slow, dont rush. In the end you disable this on the workstations servers and DC via GPO. You can take it a step further by modifying the schema and updating the MS-DSSupported Encryption types, but this isnt what ensures your not getting RC4 tickets, although it can influence it. Kinda a catch 22 there. Go slow and dont rush. Simply disabling it can introduce alot of headaches if you dont audit first. It all depends on how old the domain is and the age of the devices attached to AD. There is also some gotch-yas on Linux devices if the OS Version is specified and has a value less than 6.

In my situation, I have a /16 to share across  27 different sites, and 2 data centers. Currently that /16 is split into /23’s, one for each site. 

The issue is that the /23 is all 1  VLAN, so phones, printers, computers, cameras, etc. are all on that 1 network segment. 

I’m looking to segment those, networks into 5 or 6 VLANs. If I  configured each location with a /22 that only gives me 4 /24’s to work with. 
Some places have 20 phones or 5 printers, so a /24 for each would be way overkill, even when planning for growth. 

Using a /21 at each location would work, but that could cause issues if I ever add a 32nd site, as I’d be out of /21’s at that point.

"""Is this the correct way?"" is kind of a vague question. What are your requirements? If it's just ""create a single user in AD"" and it works for you, then yes, it's the correct way. If you want to make the solution scalable, you'll need to delve in and learn PowerShell on a deeper level. Learning general programming concepts like OOP (object oriented programming), loops, conditionals, structural best practices (line indents, bracket structure, etc.),  basic data structures, etc. Those will all help you create readable, functional scripts and automations in PowerShell. Maybe you want to eventually accept user input? Maybe you want to ingest an Excel document with multiple users and various properties for the users such as department, manager, address, etc. At some point your code may get so complex and/or long that you want to break it out into individual modules, so you'll need to learn how to create PowerShell modules using psm1 files and digest files. Start small, like you have, with a simple script to create the account. Then build on it to add functionality and slowly look up how to do each thing you want your script to do. There is no ""wrong"" answer if your script works and is secure (i.e. don't save passwords in scripts in plaintext).",1649789009,sysadmin,unseenspecter,/r/sysadmin/comments/u24q5r/powershell_script_add_new_ad_user_am_i_running/i4govgs/

"Since you obviously don't know that Lets Encrypt and other automatic certificates are free, let's discuss who doesn't know what they are talking about again???

The point of a cert is security.  If you use a PKI and issue some 10 year CA cert then 5 year regular certs than how secure it that?  It isn't very secure once I get in and steal your private key because for the next 10 years I can decrypt your stuff.  That's why you use ACME protocol and regularly change your certs.

A private cert is useless for BYOD work like iphones and carp like that.  So you have 1000 users are you gonna distribute your private CA cert to them so they can connect to your mailserver and get your mail?  I think not.

As for subdomains, the benefits of that are a lot less obvious - and of course, Microsoft does not really push them because they want you to get your domain hooked into Azure then make it impossible to ever get rid of it so you will be forever paying them.  Having a single domain both onsite and in the cloud is a Small Business approach and O365 and Azure far and away were built for small businesses, not large ones.  What Microsoft didn't realize was how lazy so many admins are in large corps, and will happily spend 3 times as much money putting a virtual server in the cloud instead of on a physical server onsite.  Once they figured that out, they started pushing Azure for large corps but they still have the small business focus in a lot of the docs.   For example note here:

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains)

The discussion of support for subdomains is AFTER the support for additional top level domains.  It's a subtle way of encouraging people to just register a second domain name when they are big enough that they want to start breaking things into more manageable chunks.  Of course they gloss over WHY you would want to do either.

There are also some people who prefer registering a separate top level domain to provide separation - so they will use [foo.com](https://foo.com) and [fooa.com](https://fooa.com) and then put all their global admin accounts into [fooa.com](https://fooa.com) and setup MFA for [fooa.com](https://fooa.com) and then not federate [fooa.com](https://fooa.com)   That way if federation blows up due to network issues or whatever else, they still have control of the domain.

As for the debate between multiple domains and a single domain with subdomains, there are clear benefits to using subdomains for your public-facing websites - a good  argument is here:

[https://techrt.com/new-domain-or-subdomain/](https://techrt.com/new-domain-or-subdomain/)

Whether you want to do that then have it reflect in your AD or whether you want to completely disconnect your AD from your public facing domains, is an argument for another post and more a personal choice thing.

But either way you do it, there's definite advantages particularly as you grow to keeping separation in a hybrid AD, whether you do that by using multiple TLDs or by subdomains of a single TLD.  Here's a good argument for doing it from the ""multiple TLD"" approach:

[https://www.managedsolution.com/recommended-practices-for-your-hybrid-identity-admin-accounts/](https://www.managedsolution.com/recommended-practices-for-your-hybrid-identity-admin-accounts/)

"joke:  what is the difference between God and a doctor?

Punchline: God doesn't think he is a doctor!

first:  is it for-profit or not-for-profit? if its not-for-profit, you may not have the overwhelming discomfort of never having what you need to do your job.  you are more likely to get it a year or two(supply chain dependent) later, versus having to wonder if anything will ever get upgraded, replaced. 

second, is it ""local / physician owned"" vs under an umbrella(don't go there) corporation that has multiple locations in multiple states? local owned is better as you are not just a fish in a pond. umbrella(again, don't do it) corporations usually have a mothership that gets all the goodies and the decisions that are made at the highest level independent of what the localities express. 

third: what emr are they using? epic? cerner? other? what is the focus of the hospital when it comes to technology?  is it just about the emr or do they care about the ancillary stuff?  is IT leadership / management about ""IT"" or are they about ""making it work""(do they have understanding about how things go together or are they just worried about keeping the C-suite, doctors happy)?",1649785828,sysadmin,big_rob_15,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1yxbt/job_descriptions_to_avoid/i4gge8d/

"There's a big problem with tech leadership right now across the board; I think it comes down to the fact that there's not good leadership/management training for technical people, and also not a strong culture if open source resources like there is for technical ICs.

This means that in practice, tech leaders are either non-technical people with management training - either via MBA schools or corporate training programs - or they're technical people who've been promoted out of their comfort zone; so technical managers either don't know the tech their teams are supposed to be working on, or they don't know how to lead.

The non-tech managers end up going full micro-manager because they constantly feel out of control and focus on hiding behind a screen of authority, which tends to lose them the respect of their people, and the promoted tech people tend to try to do everything themselves, which makes them burned out and their people disempowered.

It's even worse because tech people who do get promoted tend to be out on the self motivated / entrepreneurial end of the bell curve, so they've got no idea how to deal with people who actually need leadership - which is almost everybody.

I think we're overdue for some cultural reboots in tech teams, hopefully that'll start to happen as enough senior tech people bring the open source tech tools to bear on the problems of organizational and leadership structure.",1649783153,sysadmin,turkshead,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1yxbt/job_descriptions_to_avoid/i4g9665/

Other than checking a box, I never encountered a time where an attack was stopped by enabling TCB.  The `trustchk`/TE functionality was also useful, but it was more static and one had to be careful when updating packages, to make sure the TE database was updated, or configure TE to just warn, which means it was pretty much doing just AIDE/tripwire functionality and not actively guarding against replaced executable attacks.

"&gt;Never, ever, under any circumstances, try to implement a ""desktop backup"" solution.

This was your original response.  And what I was replying to.

There's software, like Quickbooks but also many smaller applications that are often industry specific, that do not work in an environment where they're saved in the cloud, or they're syncing, or they're on a server etc...  In this case... it's more than acceptable to use desktop back-up, in fact it your only solution.

I don't know what software you're using to make your backups, and if it's an assortment of cheap, free open source stuff, then yeah, you're gonna have a bad day...  but there are MANY reliable options that don't need to be babysat anymore than any other backup solution.

Furthermore, there are environments where older users aren't going to change, don't want to change, or flat out can't change, and guess what, you have to adapt and you can.

I'm not saying it's the BEST way, far from it. That doesn't mean it can't be done reliably, and without it falling on your neck.  My point was that if the system is designed right it'll work. You weigh all the variables, and make a decision. 

And the whole ""the recovery doesn't contain the information the system was designed for"", argument...   if that's the case, then it wasn't designed well. The only way to avoid that entirely is to image the entire machine because again, if they're saving it in a spot that isn't being backed up, or the backup isn't working, the save location doesn't matter. Someone cancels the cloud account, or doesn't pay a bill and isn't watching the backup, it's gonna fail regardless.",1649781778,sysadmin,Calling-Out-Stupid,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1mahl/workstation_backup_solutions_for_small_business/i4g5g7q/

From there, you'd stand up internal NAC to ensure the hosts are meeting security compliance before configuring an authentication proxy of some form implimented e.g. as an API.  The purpose of the authentication proxy is to impliment credential\key rotation and in a compromise to enable you to rotate keys quickly and preferably via an automated system.  Your scripts\code calls the auth proxy, gets a token of some sort, then goes and does the needful.  All of the above requires server-side software support and a minimal number of authentication mechanisms within an ecosystem, so before choosing a solution you are going to want to focus on a list of authentication mechanisms and that really is what your post is missing here.

"This depends on where you're executing the scripts.

The safest approach is to build a CLI which executes pre-approved scripts. The CLI and the scripts both get deployed to any machines where they might need to be used. This approach doesn't work if you're running scripts on, say, customer machines, of course, but if you're working within your own infrastructure, it's a much safer approach.

Short of this kind of deployment, you can have a repository of pre-approved scripts and copy them into place on-demand -- not via your clipboard, but via something like scp (which is native in Windows now, IIRC, but you could also use winscp).

Finally, I used to work in air-gapped environments, and sometimes I had to take a script I'd written inside the air gap and get it into a repo outside the air gap. The only way to do this was, basically, ""manual"" copy/pasting -- looking at one screen and typing onto another screen. But when I was done, I'd always use our diode devices and push my retyped script back into the air-gap and diff it against the original.

"Veeam was great until Insight Partners bought them.  Our next bill almost doubled after that.

I spend 1/10th the time dealing with backup stuff in general and my biggest issue is getting Wasabi to accept the data at the speeds we are pushing for offsite. But that is another story.   


After the switch to HYCU we decided we needed to backup 2 physical servers and maybe Veeam would be a good choice as HYCU doesn't have a very easy bare metal restore for physical devices.  The new Insight owned Veeam basically was requiring us to renew 28 procs on the old system before we could purchase anything new to just back up 2 physical boxes... the quote for this took about 3 months.  It was a nightmare of me trying to tell them I want a new license for 2 devices and them sending back the quote for the old system. In the end that's pretty much the only way they will do it.  Your apparently on the hook forever for some sort of cancellation tax if you ever leave them.

Personally I would stick with the first track (your current program) that includes CCNA and AWS. I think they are better for a resume than the stuff on the second track.

Put another way: you will learn and use the Azure stuff everyday as part of your job role, so you dont need a cert to demonstrate exposure to Azure. In an interview you can just talk about your job experience and projects you worked on. You can show proficiency in Azure that way. No need for Azure cert. Also dont forget certs are an ongoing time and financial burden cause you have to constantly re-up them every few years. So it is best to pick only a few high-value / high-demand certs and keep them up, rather than spreading thin on a bunch of different stuff that will bleed you dry trying to keep them all current. So think about long term which of the certs you would actually keep up on and renew. The CompTIA stuff is not highly valued so most likely I would let all of that expire.

"&gt;Is the upgrade process simple?

Stupid simple. They have the installation/update/upgrade processes down to a button push.  


Ran into a hiccup with an upgrade once due to the server receiving MS SQL updates through Windows Update. Complained that the MS SQL install that exists was a newer version than was expected and failed to update.  


And agents are also stupid simple to update. I can say, do not trust the prompt that says it does not require a server restart when updating the agent/s. For some reason maybe 1/20 servers with agents ended up requiring a restart in my experience. The console post-update the agents stating so. One prompt 'no restart needed!', after trying to update the agent 'restart needed, gotcha!'  


And in general the available updates for Veeam seem to be pumped out every few months. I am not a fan of their update processes or rather lack there of. You have to rely on email notifications of a new version being available. No check in the console. There was some sort of exploit that popped up a month ago with Veeam that was advertised. Also not a fan of their 'fix'. They pumped out a 'patch' which in other words was a 'hotfix'. If you downloaded the newest 'version' of Veeam this vulnerability would still be present. You need to also install a 'patch' which is separate from their main download of the installation Veeam, 'patch' not included.",1649778255,sysadmin,DarkEmblem5736,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1zh5q/is_veeam_still_a_recomended_backup_solution/i4fw09j/
"I was about to say, especially in a product development company, you should be fast-paced in some parts, and slow or rather careful and thorough in other areas. 

It's no real bother to me if we have teams with few or no dependencies deploying every hour. Even if some of these deployments break their service, it should be rolled back automatically or fixed forward with other deployments. Being able to move at a fast, controlled pace is an edge and there should be desire to make it faster.

And it's also fine if there is a desire to promote services - essentially their deployment automations - to prod quickly, and to provide the necessary infrastructure quickly. Again, being able to push services into production on well-beaten paths quickly is an edge as a development company.

However, the ""well-beaten"" is an important part there. If you need to integrate a new technology, a new persistence, if you need to structurally modify backups and restores. If the infrastructure is extended by something entirely new. That's when you absolutely have to go slow.

"Eh, I don't think there are that many people worrying on a personal level.  A third party sh*tting the bed on their RTOs is bad for the third party, and prompts internal teams to move things on prem.  If your company's done proper risk assessments, anything critical will be backed up by locally -- one of the standard 'questions' in a risk assessment/BCP is ""How do you maintain services if this vendor disappears overnight for a long time?"".  The more critical/material the third party, the more important it is to have a solid BCP in place.  Eg. If you just used the ticket system internally, you'd go a bit light; if you have it customer facing, you should have a bunch of contingencies prep'd to maintain customer support.  If the docs you host in conf are critical, you should have back up copies of most (potentially slightly out of date) on-prem.

If management didn't do any business continuity planning, that's an issue that could get managers fired - but it goes beyond just Atlassian screwin up.

It wont be an issue until one day you want to do hybrid domains with Azure and then if you DON'T do it that way it will be a GIANT issue.

Another thing I would advise is install win-acme on any server that needs a certificate - and literally all of them do nowadays - and use real public certs for everything from the get-go. (lets encrypt or otherwise)   Don't bother with setting up your own CA and trying to push your own certs via GPO just use real public ones for rdp gateway server, etc.

"The implementation with veeam is too new to have much to say.  The idea, however, is pretty sound.  I can't speak for how veeam does it, but the idea with theses types of setups is that you have a source with write privileges, but not modify privileges.  The target (hardened linux system) could of course do whatever it wants with its local box, but a hardened linux system with different credentials would be another barrier to get through. 

Its really just segregating roles and privileges.  You can't delete what you don't have rights to delete.  Classically, the veeam system which is accessed through an Admin logging in, via some windows system, has had the ability to wipe out all backups not sent to tape. This would no longer be true.

There are of course caveats.  If you login to manage this box, so can someone else.  Ideally, its something you'd never go on and manage with some very secure password you could only use to log on locally. The problem is that you always need to manage things, usually through remote access.

"Can't speak to whether it's due to a different issue (there are a few reasons it can), but we have this issue from time to time after a reboot.  Normally it's b/c a machine can't access the domain / DC to authenticate, but sometimes the Network Location Awareness service [is wonky](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/206851/domain-server-starts-with-wrong-network-profile.html) (for us, we see it most often on reboots).  Simplest way is to restart the NLA service (which on servers also restarts Network List Service), and it should revert to Domain if it's a domain-joined machine or Private if you don't have one. However, a lot of services are blocked on Public by default (such as RDC) so when this occurs you can't remote in to correct it.

However, you can 'Add Server' to add the problem server to one with working NLA via Server Manager and restart its service from there.  Sometimes though WMI may not be running, so you might have to do it [via PS](https://www.itprotoday.com/powershell/how-force-network-type-windows-using-powershell) if you can't physically KVM the machine.

Haven't seen this issue much lately but there were a few years there where like every other reboot caused it on some machines.  in some cases this was because there were old disconnected Hyper-V virtual switch definitions or removed NICs in device manager that needed to be un-hidden and manually removed, or old network profiles that had to be removed from the registry.",1649777861,sysadmin,lordcochise,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1q5q5/patch_tuesday_megathread_20220412/i4fuyo9/

Veeam's basic responsibility here is to make sure you can't delete data on those repositories from within their platform until the immutable retention period has passed. Root access on the repository server is going to bypass any protections Veeam can put in place, so you need to seriously lockdown the repository servers.

"Agree with alot of your comments...

\- no control over upgrades of firmware, it gets delegated at Sophos' leisure...

\- Central dashboard is trash, since they moved to per customer, you cannot manage your firewalls, only the firewall in a customer tenant, or if multiples, only that customer's firewalls.

\- Adding exceptions is a huge, needless pain of enabling things that should be enabled by default, because you're manually importing them, because you need them, so why not enable by default? simply dumb...

\- SophosConnect is problematic, agreed, no idea why the SSL is EOL at the end of this month.  I've had more luck with it than SophosConnect, SSL is more common, more robust, easier to configure, but lets use this other product that has our name on instead of what works better...

\- Having worked with almost a dozen other firewalls myself, Sophos is the first vendor whose partner support is literally non-existent, like, have NEVER called or reached out to us, to offer training, or to offer swag, incentives, or diddly squat...  I have a closet full of shirts, hats, bags, coffee cups, tons of notepads from other vendors.... Sophos gives zero things away...

\- Sophos support is severely lacking actual support.  90% of the time, after 48hrs, you might get an email saying something or they send a link and say follow this.

\- Control Center is not cluttered, its informative.  If you don't like it, there's a whole navigation bar available to take that cluttered page away from view.

\- Reporting does suck

\- AD integration absolutely sucks, comletely

\- and there are alot of little differences that make it 'not what you want', but this is what you have, and unless you have the authority, power and money to make that change, its where you are.

My guess is you are in a corporate environment, and I'm almost 100% sure you could live in harmony with your Sophos, but I'm sure that you'd also be unhappy with anything that wasn't specific to your abilities to manage.  You're outside of your comfort zone and you want to blame the irritant that causes your itch...

I work for an MSP, we have hundreds of Sophos devices in place, and have zero functional issues.

Do MUVPNs cause some headaches?  absolutely...

Does the lack of support cause some indigestion?  for real...

Does it bother me that Sophos support is under-staffed, under-developed, struggling to keep up with demand?  daily.....

Do I worry that the device won't do what I need it to do? not really, I can make it dance if I want to...

Have I seen challenges with Sophos?  Yes, but I overcame them, researched it myself and fixed my problem before support had a chance to even read my support request.

"I don't agree with your line of thinking at all. Protecting someone's data isn't a matter of liability. It's a matter of the users, and the ""providers"" developing a solution that works best for all involved based on a number of variables, including budget, training, and workflow.  

If your goal is to ""pass the buck"" then sure... but ""save it on the server"" is no different than ""save it on your desktop/documents"" the user still has to be the one to save it to the agreed location...  if you say save it on the server, and they save it on the C drive, you're ( collectively ) still fucked. 

Any system that is designed and implemented correctly, and TESTED CONSTANTLY will mitigate data loss.  If you automate something, and don't look at it till you need the data, you're asking for trouble.  Similarly, new and future employees need to be trained, and shown where to save it.  

In my opinion, your worry of liability has no bearing on ""where it's saved"" it's all about getting it in writing about what you agreed on, and then every party needs to do their part.  If the person says you told them ""all the data was safe!"" and you have a document that shows "" we agreed to backup DOCUMENTS and DESKTOP of all users"" then it doesn't matter where the data is, all that matters is that you did what you said you would.

The sooner you implement the ticket system and ""train"" the users to use it rather than walk up the better off you'll be. 

One method to deter the walk up routine is when they're finished telling their life stories and asking for help, just simply tell them in a nice manner, ""If you could throw in a help desk ticket for me for this issue I'll gladly help you out as soon as I get a free chance.  That way I don't forget about your issue while I'm working on other issues.""  At first they're be apprehensive but will get the idea that you don't have time to just drop everything and help them.

Helpdesk - unfortunately often just treat the symptoms
Sysadmin - should be able to treat the cause

The toughest but most rewarding parts of being Sysadmins is about the continuous learning of the systems you manage, learning piece by piece. It keeps you interested, but it can be quite tiring.

One of the toughest parts is finding workplaces or opportunities to take the next steps.

"A couple things to add to this having been down this this road.

You will be touching this computer a lot. Most things that you would setup as a script/GPO for a PC will be easier to do manually because there is only 1 Mac.

The user will not be happy if they don't have admin rights. Be prepared to have this discussion. Macs require a admin login for so many things, you will be remoted in there all the time. 

There is a good selection of apps on Mac platforms, but many have reduced features (I am looking at you Outlook) that can break workflows

SMB shares on Macs are hit and miss. 

Apple will send updates and changes down that will break things outside of the update chain and there is no way to stop them as the user will not even be notified. 

Apple does not allow you to do a lot, and there is nothing that you can do about it. 

In my small sample, Macboooks need more hardware service than business class PCs, so get applecare. They are pretty good about covering stuff without a bunch of grief with applecare.

Have the user create a new appleID with their corp email address, this will save you headaches if they leave.

I must've misread the job ad then, BLS OES Job wage data shows pay rates at the 50th percentile are \[x\] and at the 90th percentile are \[y\] and it sounds like your company is pushing for someone like me who's never had a disappointed boss and always saves or makes their company a ton of money.  Let me ask you this, If you are looking for a top player at way below market rates, How do you know you are not staffing for a company that's in deep financial trouble or your boss hasn't set you up for failure?""  

This has never, ever failed to REALLY trip up and pull the carpet out from under an HR Drone because once you tug on that line of insecurity (they get imposter syndrome too) you can push on and eventually break the HR drone's spirit.  You just give them useful economic and geopolitical information and references to go look at during the phone screen, takes 5-10 minutes.  Once that's done, they then go back to their boss and start asking uncomfortable questions, ""we had this really interesting conversation with this candidate.""

"The easy way, as already mentioned, use gparted to shrink the partition (live boot image from [Gparted.org](https://Gparted.org))

However, this will only make the partition smaller, not the drive. If you do something like  
dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/other/drive/backup.img  
The complete 1 TB drive will be written to the backup.img file, including the unused space.   
Using gzip will bring down the image size, but if not all of the ""unused"" space is filled with 0  
it will still take up space.

  
You will need to backup each partition seperatly, then you would only be saving the ""used"" part of the drive. i would still recommend using gzip for smaller files e.g.

dd if=/dev/sda1 | gzip  &gt; /path/to/other/drive/backup\_sda1.img  
dd if=/dev/sda1 | gzip  &gt; /path/to/other/drive/backup\_sda2.img

"&gt;Keyboard shortcuts for the rest (though the new interface does help on my laptops (non-touch) and surface devices).

If I wanted to use a keyboard shortcut, I wouldn't have right-clicked to begin with.

&gt;Show more options gives you the classic menu if you need it, of course. So those options are all still there.

Ah, extra clicks to get to a quick option, just everyone wants. And is there a setting to just show the full options all the time for power users? No, there's a registry key, and how people found it I have no idea.

&gt;That new simplified menu isn't going away. Hate it or love it (it's more usable in some scenarios, especially stubborn trackpads, but that's another thing entirely). Settings has a lot more functionality now, it's extremely rare to have to go back to classic control panels anymore, especially for audio settings now (thank fucking god). 

Yet you still can't set a static IP or partition a drive. At this point they've gone from having a single unified settings area that worked in XP/7, the control panel, to now 3 Windows versions that have some level of control split between control panel and settings. They keep promising that settings will get better, like an abusive boyfriend who will change if you just give him another shot. And they keep making it harder to get to the control panel app you actually need.

&gt;I've yet to encounter the game running in a separate virtual desktop, and i've got about ~250 games installed on this machine. Everything from CS:GO to EVE to FFXIV to Civilization V to GTA V to Cyberpunk 2077 to original DOOM. 

Halo: MCC. It's extremely frustrating to be in a co-op game, have something in the background steal focus, and then be stuck waiting for your teammate to finish the level so it saves before you kill the process. I did find a workaround online that worked, but I don't remember off the top of my head what it was.

And yes, in 2022 we are playing the halo series for the first time.

&gt;As to the drivers, just install the latest DCH from nVidia's site, or - don't do that at all and use the inbox drivers as i've gone to doing which has worked great on devices from my desktop (2x 1080 Ti's) to laptops and hybrid / disconnectable graphics situations ranging from 1660 Ti's to 940M's.

I have installed the latest drivers from Nvidia 4 or 5 times in the last few weeks. I can immediately tell when 11 has ""updated"" the driver, I open Warframe and instead of running at 120fps or so, it runs at 10. In the login screen. That is not acceptable performance for a 2070 super. And it's extremely frustrating when I get done work and have an hour to play games, I have to regularly waste 10 minutes of that hour reinstalling drivers.

&gt;AutoHDR has been a godsend on my main display for a lot of games, as well as 11 fixing performance issues in a lot of games I had under 10 - tom clancy ghost recon wildlands is now playable under 4K with stupid high settings instead of basically being a slideshow.

And it's been an annoyance for me. Some games I just don't want HDR, I'm gaming in a dark room at night and it just makes things too bright. Especially Breakpoint, it makes the weapon quality indicators glow a stunning yellow, magenta, or blue that I didn't think possible from an LCD before, but when you're tired and the room is dark, it's just too much. It's also annoying that Windows has an auto HDR nag literally every time you open a game, weather it's enable or not.

&gt;You couldn't pay me to go back to 10 at this point (just as 10 was with 8/8.1, and 8/8.1 was with 7, etc.... well, okay, Between XP and 8 - 2004 to 2011 - I was pretty much linux (and unix/VMS) only, took 8 to bring me back with the under the hood architecture and security fixes, but still).

#I generate a date string to use for a unique filename.

#i use the Select-object to force the order of the columns and filter to columns i want to see in the particular instance of the log file.

"I recently took a middle management position where the hiring manager kept saying that ""there is a lot of opportunity"" there in addition to being ""fast paced.""

After taking the position, I quickly realized that ""opportunity"" meant that the department head had essentially let the the division get out of control for the better part of five years. There was a recent merger with a much larger company that was handled poorly and left infrastructure and process in shambles. (Which in my experience is typical, as while time is spent getting inter-operability up, zero time is spent by the parent company closing out the project.)

Datacenter is a convoluted mess. Switches and border/aggregation/load balancing appliances are years out of date. Routing is spaghetti. The small team I inherited had essentially been left to their own devices since COVID, and are unfamiliar to structure. (They're getting better, but I've got one engineer on a PIP already because he literally does nothing for six figures a year and has been proven to be dishonest, and parent company policy dictates that I can't fire him outright without going through a lengthy coaching plan.) Documentation is absent to a, frankly, startling degree, and the VP is more interested spending time spending time at home than providing any meaningful support to decisions I make that would see any measurable progress towards long term objectives or general improvement. (As managers are essentially neutered by having to route nearly every decision/action through that level of management.)

Oh, and senior leadership is under the impression for some reason that the company is ""really close"" to NIST/CMMC compliance, which is an absolute joke on multiple levels. (My gap analysis was definitely not what they wanted to hear/see.) Opportunity"" indeed.

I've since learned that the company has been through 3 managers in the last 2 years, and after only 6 months of me being there I feel that that number will soon be 4. 

I suppose the lesson here is to get to the core of of the actual meaning of anything that comes off as buzz-wordy or glib during the interview process. If it's a vacancy, get a good answer as to why the position is open and why the previous person left.

"\&gt;Rather than 'remote work being over' I think it's just beginning.

"At our company we have the usual dev/staging/prod environments.

- It's relatively easy (but takes a bit of work) to stand an app up, isolated, in-memory and test it.  You can say with high confidence that ""this app behaves like X, in isolation, given this test configuration"".

- Then it gets deployed to dev, where now it has to play with other apps in the ecosystem.  And deal with the dev configuration (which may differ slightly from the test configuration).  Poke it with more automated tests and you can say ""yes, this behaves correctly for this configuration"".

You can probably spot the pattern.  Each move to a new environment, with a new configuration, involves risks that can't be tested in the prior environment.  Firewalls, networking, hardware/VMs, configuration files, environment variables -- all of that could differ in some small way if your company is not careful.

"It's about where the responsibility for the data lies.

If there's a ""backup solution"" then they stop paying any kind of attention to where they put things. Seemingly, the more robust the solution, the more likely they are to go far out of their way to circumvent it in some catastrophic way.

Then, when the system inevitably fails and they have lost the very thing you swore was protected, it's your fault. Any fault tolerance or redundancy you put in place will fil and not be repaired or replaced. Any ""special rules"" you create to trap data will just turn into a list of places they aren't going to put things. The whole system will erode and fall over, at the worst possible moment.

No. The idea is you teach them in real world terms that they are responsible for the whereabouts of their data. Cloud storage gives them availability, everything else is on them.

Think about it. Any no-shit enterprise companies worth their salt tell their users ""if you save stuff locally, you're not in compliance."" Why do you think that is? Because they learned this lesson a long, long time ago.

"Well you ask billable employees to log their billable time so you can bill the customer. That's just sensible.

As far as non-billable employees it's a sticky slope. While you certainly can ask them to log their hours whether billing or not, it leads to a sense that you are micromanaging and looking over their shoulder. It actually encourages a decline in productivity because said employees will spend a lot of time actually figuring out how to pad their hours so they look busier than they are. And having a metric like ""hours"" is completely at odds with the idea of results-based management because time spent on work is not a result but rather a consequence.

There's a certain amount of negotiation with the employee with RBM in so long as you're a halfway decent manager you already have a good idea of how long a particular task or project should take. The employee can certainly push back and say they can't complete it in the time allotted, and certainly there's room for that sort of negotiation. But RBM basically means you as a manager should have a good idea of what results you expect and manage according to that... the ACTUAL hours spent on a task or project are actually then irrelevant to the discussion of results.

There's definitely a good chance that some of your employees may end up working a lot fewer hours than others given the same workload; they may just be rockstars at particular tasks and get them done quickly. But again, your goal is to manage to what they produce not necessarily how much time they spend producing.

It's worth noting that results-based management is not a fit for every job. I find it works really well with professional white-collar sort of jobs; office jobs and the like. But it doesn't fit for every job type. My team are systems integration engineers and as such I as the systems architect know pretty well how long they'll take on a particular task. When I assign the jobs I also know through experience who will get the jobs done quicker so I tend to load them up with additional tasks so that they'll remain busy. I have a very happy team of engineers.

It's also worth noting that results-based management is also something where you should and should be seen to ""roll up your sleeves"" and be part of the job at hand rather than just managing from afar. I often take time as the SA to work out in the field with my SE's which helps them feel like I'm one of them but also informs my knowledge of how each SE works.",1649766520,sysadmin,Sinister_Crayon,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15l5m/fortune_says_remote_work_is_over/i4f45l7/

"My career advice has stayed pretty consistent over the last decade+ 

- The natural lifespan of 'a job' is about 2 years. That's about how long it takes to go through the cycle of 'getting up to speed' -&gt; 'being productive' -&gt; 'stagnating'.  (IN GENERAL - this isn't true for every job). 

- You should therefore at the 2 year mark refresh your CV circulate it, and see what sort of prospects are available. Compare what's on offer with what you have now, and use that to assess your fair market value

- You can clear off before 2 years if needed, but in general if you can't see yourself there for that long, it's probably the wrong job to accept in the first place. (I mean, I get it - real life happens, and sometimes you've no choice). 

- You can decide to stay if you feel your current employer is meeting your needs. Be that professionally, compensation, work life balance, whatever - that's up to you. 

- You should _not_ stay just because it's feeling 'comfortable'. 

- Repeat this exercise each year or so thereafter. Sometimes your current employer has room to grow your career further, and supports you in doing so. Sometimes it does not. That's no one's fault, it's just a fact of life. 

With that in mind:

&gt; a maximum income increase (if 100% booked) by around 45%.

This looks like a bit of a red flag to me. Are you saying they're paying you based on your bookings? If so, that sounds like 'contracting' to me, and I'd expect more like 100% increase to compensate for volatility. (e.g. as a contractor, you can very easily find you've unpaid weeks or months, because you're basically an expensive 'temp'). 

&gt; I am quite torn inside, my current employer was also the company that hired me as apprentice and trained me.

Employment is an ongoing and mutual relationship, where you trade your time, experience and expertise for compensation. Training and career development can count as 'compensation'. But you owe them no ongoing debt for supplying these things - chances are they factored that in to your initial payscale when they hired you. 

So - move on if you feel it's right, and feel no guilt to the employer you're leaving. If you feel their offer isn't enough, then... well, there you go. 

&gt;  During my last year i got the AZ103, AZ303, AZ304 and the Sophos Cert.

With a bundle of certificates and a fiver, I can buy a coffee. They're IMO meaningless in terms of value - what matters is what you learned and how you improved in doing them. If you've got some good 'value add' with those skillsets, then that's what matters now.  Certs might in some employers get you in the door in the first place I guess, but don't expect too much of them. 

&gt; What would you do? Cheers

I'd look around a bit more, and see what other options there are - see if the new place you're looking at is really as good as it looks. At the very least I'd be asking about that 'what if I'm not 100% booked' and what you'd get paid in that scenario, and is that +45% figure genuinely realistic.

"I think we've gone out of topic, a lot.
Remote work can't be a long term solution for more than a small % of people.
Either that or everyone.
If everyone works from home, then you structure your company for it, otherwise you don't, simple as that.
If you have people stuck at home while others are at office it becomes hard to coordinate and cooperate cause you need to reach out everyone.

Working from home sure increase productivity.
1) It does cause if you're experienced you don't get bothered as much to help others
2) it doesn't but you're lazy and want to stay at home.

The problem is that those with less experience are stuck and will never grow to be seniors.
It's like home school for them, it isn't effective but no kid will tell you so cause they don't like it, as much as adults don't like office.
Grow up.

Now let's reach out to the people who went out of topic.

Often if you don't need to travel with gas you still need heating at home and electricity there plus the distractions.
Kids, parents and so on (i'll make an exception for pets)
Often are an issue.

It's just better to heat up only one office with 10 people instead of 10 different homes.
In my area since the prices for gas and electricity went up people started caring about it, no lights left on in offices, no computers left on uselessly, no heating and open windows (or thermostat where there wasn't, pretty cheap to install).

Now we are doing it cause of prices, but we were smart enough to do it even previously.

"The cloud is more than getting someone else to host your existing infrastructure on their servers. There's bigger transformations happening.

For instance, when we adopted virtualisation, we started running more server instances to better isolate workloads so instead of losing DC/DNS/DHCP/Intranet/Mail all at once, you lose only one or two of those, and instead of them failing completely they fail over to a redundant instance. The new tech changed how we do thing.

Same with cloud generally. People moved from in house to IaaS to PaaS and SaaS. Some workloads are now serverless where you don't need to administer a server at all. There's also the capacity of individuals to spin up instances on demand. There's a more complex infrastructure under all of that capacity, but it's managed at scales where it works.

And the economies of scale within large datacentres does mean that they can so much more with less. Those large providers like AWS/Rackspace/DigitalOcean/Google/MS are orders of magnitude bigger than the dozens of servers you might have had running in house, where consolidation brings smaller benefits. The capacity to just fail over anything, to remove a rack of servers, to put work loads in places they belong, to outsource work to places with cheap wages, to invest extra time and money into orchestration and automation, to standardise environments, all those things that aren't so easily achievable at the scales at which most businesses operate.

"Okay, so I have done exactly what you're describing/wanting. First question, does the printer that is being used support ZPL printing?  You also described the shared printer method of printing. Did that work for you previously?

Years ago I wrote a custom PowerShell script that runs at login on all of our shipping computers and checks the user's Downloads folder to see if there are any ZPL files. When it finds a ZPL file it prints it out automatically and deletes the file out of the downloads folder.  I deploy this with a GPO and have group policy settings configured to have both Chrome and Edge automatically download all files.

I haven't touched this in a couple of years but it's been running flawlessly for at least that long as evidenced by the fact that no one has complained about it.

I might be able to supply at least a basic version of this if I get some time to look through it and clean it up and remove anything specific to the company I work for.

The other suggestion I have when it comes to ZPL printing is to install the Chrome zpl printer emulator.  It works great for testing zpl labels and prints it out to the screen so you're not wasting a ton of labels. I've used it for a lot of testing.

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zpl-printer/phoidlklenidapnijkabnfdgmadlcmjo?hl=en-US


That printer emulator relies on a free online rendering engine. You can go directly to that as well and put in zpl code to see what it would look like on a printer.

"I work at a place the makes, among many other things, cleanroom air systems.

What you should look for is a ""sealed-positive pressure enclosure"".

It'll be a box that the computer sits in and has positive clean air pressure going to it.

I'd recommend going thin client or micro depending on your backend infra.  Makes the enclosure much smaller.

The monitor would be in it's own case, again ideally positive pressure, but with it being the least expensive main component it doesn't have to be.

On the outside of the case would be USB connections that go to the computer.  Kinda like an extension cord that goes to a sealed gasket box you can open and close.

Put the wireless keyboard/mouse receive in there and seal it up.

Most of this can be made in-house if you are DIY enough and have access to the right machinery.

At a coffee house, especially in the grinding areas or the separation areas, you need to look out for static most of all.  This may preclude a positive pressure option.

Back when I started in IT, I was the sole administrator (network/system) for a small business that implemented a software that would “backup” the workstation to a mapped drive.

You know, like most small businesses. Well we had one hard drive fail but RAID was able to handle it. I tried to get them to cover replacing the drive and having a spare on hand but it kept getting denied. Low and behold a second drive fails and we lose everything.

To make matters worse, people were using that mapped drive to store documents because their hard drives were getting full. The VP of Sales comes to my desk stating he needed his presentation for a client right away and I had to do everything possible to get it back. I just got chewed out by my manager for the outage, that was my fault because I didn’t get any of my requests in writing (I’ve since learned to always have a paper trail for any request) so he stated he didn’t know anything about the failed hard drive. So when the VP of Sales started ripping into me, it was the only time in my work life I stuck up for myself. Well that was the beginning of the end of my employment there.

"The article is a bit of a beat up. The actual survey is questionable, and doesn't fully support the conclusions in the article.

If you look at what the survey says managers actually think about returning to the office

&gt;25% of managers desired a fully-remote model, 33% wanted employees fully in-office, and 42% preferred a hybrid setting

So those wanting fully in office are a minority.

And take these titbids:

&gt; 73% of managers said productivity and engagement had either improved or stayed the same with remote work compared to in-office work.  
&gt;  
&gt;68% of managers said a fully remote operation would either add to their profit or the bottom line would stay the same.  
&gt;  
&gt;68% of managers shared that hiring processes had either entirely changed or had moved mostly remote.

So it's clear that survey shows *reality* is different from what managers want. 

The other thing that doesn't get talked about so much is the relationship between personality and preference for working remote/office. Managers *tend* towards being ""people people"" (score higher on extraversion) and the data out of the pandemic and lockdowns show that there is a relationship between extraversion and poorer mental health in lockdowns. So managers are likely to *prefer for themselves* to work in the office. 

In the end that 77% figure is basically: ""Would you fire an employee for not following a direct instruction?"" and not really a deep insight into the actual chances of a wholesale ""return to the office"".

I'll leave with this last quote from the survey report:

"We let user create M365 Groups, mainly because we're a university and the idea of not allowing was just never going to happen.

* Exchange address policy that defaults all M365 Groups to a domain of @groups.[domain].edu.


* Group expiration policy of a few hundred days. (forgot the exact number right off hand, but it's a semester + another few months)


* Group naming policy that adds "" (UserCreated)"" as a suffix to Group names. Units that want an ""official"" Group/Team must reach out to IT to create it in the first place, or for us to vet a particular Group/Team and remove the tag from the Group name, Group email address, and SharePoint site URL.  Our training &amp; documentation basically equates the lack of ""UserCreated"" to be like a blue star in Twitter -- It's official and has been vetted as such.


* One of our daily scripts has an additional command to hide any Groups from the address book that have ""UserCreated"" in the Group email address.

"I can understand the want to bring teams together (social cohesion, visibility, etc), but the reality is however.

"Agreed, a concern may be warranted but your company's security concerns are valid. The apple mail app is downloading company data (email) with no policies to protect it.

Put the company in the scenario that your phone is stolen and the thief has gotten past the lock screen, they can now do what they want in your email and the company has zero control over your device since they do not own it.

With MAM they can require a PIN in the Outlook app, or MFA every time, they can set a timeout policy so it closes when idle if your phone is left somewhere, they can prevent screenshots and copying+pasting.

"I'm really quite upset and frustrated about this one. As the owner of a MSP, and one who has been using Autotask (Datto PSA) since 2017, (and prior to that before I started my MSP back in the 2000's) this is a real kick in the nuts. We've really enjoyed both Autotask and Datto RMM. We also use IT Glue (only Kaseya product in our stack).

We've had IT Glue for a little over 2 years now and considered moving away from the product. Their sales tactics and pushy approach of additional products has left a bad taste in our mouths. While it did improve procedure and documentation internally, little to no improvement has been made on the product since we started using it.

On the flip side, Datto RMM and Autotask have made GREAT improvements over the past couple of years. It's fairly evident that these products will go the way of IT Glue, with price increases, lack of improvement and development, and likely ridiculous contracts, probably without even telling us.

The thought of having to rebuild and restart so many facets of the business in light of Kaseya buying Datto has me feeling really frustrated and concerned. Implementation of a new PSA/RMM is not an easy task, nor one to take lightly. It literally takes years to adapt after switching.

"At that point you're basically using powershell ad a programming language more than just a scripting language, so it involves knowing some programming concepts.  If you take a few online programming classes then you can pick up powershell syntax pretty easily.

The short answer, my approach is:
1. Define input and desired output: what do I have (events in sql server) and what do I want to have (well structured json?)
2. Plan out a logical sequence of events and try to get it to work for even one input, even if sloppy
3. After you get it to work to some degree, refactor the code - put some parts of it into functions to generalize that portion (e.g.  don't write the same code to connect/run sql every time. Make a sql function)
4. Continue testing and refactoring, fixing bugs and adding error handling.

Do expand on 2, you can just take it one step at a time.  One you've done it once, it's way easier to do N times.  In my case, it was like:

1. Figure out SQL query in SQL studio on a SQL server to get the most recent events from the event file
2. Figure out how to run a sql query from powershell
3. Combine 1 and 2 to get powershell to request the events
4. Figure out how to manipulate the data returned from sql, like print out specific pieces of it
5. Figure out how to generalize that data, in my case I used a hash table initially
6. Figure out how to turn that generalized data into json
7. Figure out how to write that json to a file
8. Iterate, how do I make it so the script only requests new events since last time?",1649727876,sysadmin,spokale,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15rz8/do_you_use_powershell_a_lot/i4dfial/

Sure there are people who abuse working from home, but typically they are the same people who abused their time while in the office as well.

You are also empowering your employees with your trust that they can perform while ‘unsupervised’.  From what I’ve seen, most are honest and if anything feel more obligated to spend more time on work items after regular hours because they can and it’s easier for them to do so.

"LOL great questions... so here's the clarification

&amp;#x200B;

1. Formatted C drive and Win Enterprise installation
2. audit mode
3. Customized start tiles, turned off power management, added layout customizatons in windows\\shell
4. ran sysprep with copy profile command
5. after oobe,inside first user
6. installed office
7. installed Cisco amp (this might be it.. )
8. deployed chrome from script in silent mode ver 87 (hadn't updated install folder
9. allowed chrome to auto update to 100
10. It all dies at that point
11. uninstalled chrome
12. removed programdata &amp; appdata google directories
13. clean install of 100 from web
14. See line 10

I lean towards cisco amp being the culprit but this puppy worked in version 87 and after 100 creamed version 95 works just fine.

It's just finding out what v100 is not liking.  No real symptoms except chrome instantly closes on opening. (run as admin same behavior)

Different profile/ same behavior.

It's something in the build but the damned thing worked in versions prior to 100.  (also if i allow 95 to update to 100 boom dead again.

Major considerations I think are: Version 100 has something different than 95.  V95 did NOT have an issue.  I'm going to try disabling amp first and try again and see if it stays up.  I can get to process explorer but that program is a huge time suck for me if I (sadly thinking I am) going to have to use it.

So at this point running SFC I firmly believe wastes my time.  There is something in the build that version 100 is not playing nice with.  Win 10 or 11 same results with above steps.",1649725014,sysadmin,Sid_Sheldon,/r/sysadmin/comments/twafru/chrome_is_doing_an_excellent_job_of_making_me/i4d8x1y/

"First off, dont charge back. Not even on a 'bonus check' if they decide to sue over lost wages they will win. As the company you are required to supply them with working equipment that is required for the job. 

That being said, this is where BYOD comes in. Change company policy so that WFH requires BYOD and setup remote access (VDI, Citrix, VPN, ...etc) with a system like Intune so that you can remote wipe company data portal access when needed. Then the employee is required to furnish their own hardware for WFH scenarios.

..If the employee was already hired for WFH, or was already told they can WFH and its not just a 'during these times' kinda thing then you can only do this for new hires again see first paragraph. But nothing that cant be changed by forcing employees back to the office for a short time in order to re-write policy before allowing them remote again. 

But as far as getting funding for damaged equipment, this is more of a management then IT issue.

* LXCI for Windows Admin Center is a buggy piece of shit that you should avoid at all costs. I don't know about VMware. It also claims in places that you *need* the LXCA for some things but you don't, it's just not ""as supported"" as one Lenovo rep told me.

"As a practice, we allow this. MS wants to do it and no use fighting it because you will be fighting all the tools every step of the way. That said, there are a few steps you can take:

- As /u/dcg1k said, set a group content expiration policy. So, orphaned groups with no owners go away after whatever period of time you specify.

- Embrace self-service: We communicate the O365 self-service policy annually. When users open tickets to created groups or modify membership, we immediately close the ticket with ""Please contact the Group Owner for assistance."" Make sure you emphasize to executives that IT is ""staying out of the way"" and letting users use the tools given to them. I.e., they can shoot themselves in both feet without IT's assistance.

- We set a 3-letter prefix policy to all user-created O365 groups to easily identify them. You know the reason.

- We set the default domain for O365 groups to a domain we do not route email from externally. Meaning, users cannot backdoor ""business critical mailboxes"" and then lose their minds when something does not work correctly, email gets deleted, or whatever other inanity users to with mailboxes without telling IT.

"It's been a few years since I used Lenovo servers, but the circa-2017 management was awful compared to the Dell and HPE options. Hopefully it has improved.

I definitely prefer iDRAC9 over iLO5 - we're a Linux shop and the HPE's lack of proper on-screen keyboard makes ctrl-alt-f1 (quite a necessary shortcut) nearly impossible to press.

Where the Dell really takes the lead though is the fleet-management tools for managing lots of machines (templating and applying configuration, rolling out bulk firmware updates, etc). OpenManage Enterprise is so far ahead of HPE's equivalents it's just not even a competition.

Also the cost of the higher-tier iDRAC licenses is negligible if bought with the machine. Upgrading later is $$$$$. Ask for ""Enterprise"" on regular servers, or ""Datacentre"" if you have high-powered stuff like GPU systems, and if you order the ""OpenManage Enterprise advanced"" license you get some pretty swish power management and monitoring features in OME that are well worth the price of admission.",1649723640,sysadmin,qupada42,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1lbz5/xclarity_vs_ilo_vs_idrac/i4d5u4d/

"Let me tell this.
So to make the story short companies only learn after they lose. 

I was the lead windows tech in my company. And the backup guy for non Unix systems (Unix like AIX or HP-UX not Linux) Arcserver, Backup Exec, netbackup and Veeam. 
They needed someone to manage a huge SCCM environment and I take this too, they started to sell Dell servers and I did all technical courses and some specifically for sales that enabled them to sell storage and network equipment. I have customers who demanded in contracts that if I leave the company they would be in a breach of contract and they could cancel without paying because I was know in the Exchange field.
Government contracts that demand a certified professional and I was the only certified in that technology.

My company had a program where they would pay half of what you expend in academic as a reward for you to try to improve, since I was doing my masters I asked them to pay 30% of it going forward.
I made good enough but since I saw everyone bellow me have the bill payed in full for their college tuition I asked for some too.

They didn't denied it, they simply don't replied, I have to take a tooth and have some complications and couldn't speak for a few days, still had to support when a would be customer needed some support after hours, after I fixed their broken Exchange 2003 Environment (this was in 2016 mind you) the would be still not signed the deal because of this I never received for those hours. 
They made a huge over promises in a Exchange 2007 to Exchange 2013 and Exchange online migration and when I asked someone to help me they put the most junior person on the entire team to help. 

This was the day I decided to jump ship, I only joking decided to enter in the Army as a technical Officer. One day before I gave them my notice I asked my boss how things are going with my masters allowance, he them asked personally to the owner and the owner replied he would have to make a performance assessment to see if I deserve this (The value I was asking for was less than 10% of my base pay and they used the fact I was doing a masters to overcharge one customer). The next day I signed the papers in the army and gave them my notice. The same day they offered a huge raise and full pay of my masters. Easely 70% or more.
I said no.
After I leave the company they discovered they couldn't sell Dell storage and network anymore, had to pay someone to get Citrix CCAA, and three customers threatened cancelation because I was put  in their contract because we had previous relationships. 
In the end they have to pay me half of me payment for sometime until they finished the certification In citrix with one of the guys in my team (and this guy just left the company to work in Ireland less than a year after that), I needed to go in some meetings to convince the customers to not cancel with them and our team was good enough and I would still consult with them if needed. 
Almost all managed backups customers leave them for another MSP in less than two years after I left because find someone who knows Arcserver, backup exec, netbackup and Veeam isn't so easy so they need to hire two guys. 
In the end I received way more that if they had just payed half my masters and hired someone to help me.",1649722289,sysadmin,BruFoca,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1didc/i_try_to_be_positive_but_the_situation_degrades/i4d2sax/

"Because a restore of a product made up of 20 different add-ons isn't as simple as:

    cp ./backup ./prod

When everything is decentralized - across multiple databases and systems - the restoration has to go in stages to make sure that every system stays ""sane"" at each step relative to every other system so that the end result functions as intended.

From [Track storage and move data across products](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/track-storage-and-move-data-across-products/):

&gt;**Can Atlassian’s RDS backups be used to roll back changes?**  
&gt;  
&gt;We cannot use our RDS backups to roll back changes. These include changes such as fields overwritten using scripts, or deleted issues, projects, or sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is because our data isn’t stored in a single central database. **Instead, it is stored across many micro services, which makes rolling back changes a risky process.**  
&gt;  
&gt;To avoid data loss, we recommend making regular backups. For how to do this, see our documentation:  
&gt;  
&gt;Confluence – [Create a site backup](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-a-site-backup)  
&gt;  
&gt;Jira products – [Exporting issues](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/export-issues)

If I had to guess, the 2-week timeframe is because they're doing exactly that. Manually going through the risky process of data restoration for a subset of their users.

On the flip side, this could mean this policy will change as they're being forced to evaluate a way to automate this process and improve its reliability and accessibility, so this doesn't happen again and to give some kind of confidence to those affected in the future.",1649722030,sysadmin,WonderfulWafflesLast,/r/sysadmin/comments/u14qqq/atlassian_just_gave_us_an_estimate_on_our_support/i4d27qn/

I watched a person take the new laptop out of the bag, put it in their purse and half way up the stairs drop their purse and shatter a brand new X1 carbon laptop. Not a shit given.

We said nope and called their manager as they got red in the face about how the rules were pointless, etc.

The manager tried to laugh it off as an accident until the laptop tech pulled out a stack of mangled laptops and said, ""By our calculation they've destroyed nearly ten grand in hardware, I've got plenty of end of life laptops they're welcome to abuse, otherwise I think we need to start crosscharging your department.""

"just an FYI - i wrote this from the POV of an MSP - i'm a COO of one. Its located in europe (different beast entirely compared to the U.S.) and employs currently about 300+ \*admins (plus support personnel).

We do ludecrous amounts of screeing on potential new employees (its mostly about the type of person and their (soft-)skills), and the odd security clearence (comes with the type of business). I think it is what accounts for the only turnover we have had since i've been here (4+ years at the company and in management) being for personal reasons (e.g. creating own company, moving for a partner, health issues, retirement, etc); or not making it past probationary period ( 6 month by law). I can honestly say we didn't have a single burnout case since our management team bought this MSP.

I guess it helps that this is european health insurance teritory, company childcare for working parents, 6 hour shifts and tax-free markups for overtime, weekend and nigfht shifts. paid on-call/on-standby ; and enough admins to be able to make it ""opt-in"".

We also have a regorous training/certification  shedule and yearly raises to account for inflation and the level-ups generated in terms of technical skills / knowlledge gained.

"&gt; Here's the million dollar question, though: Is it worth losing a quality employee over three grand? 

Indeed, it is. That's why management isn't as simple as it looks.

Here's the other million dollar question, though: Is it three grand, or is it three grand *over and over*? You did ask ""what do you do when the employee doesn't change their ways"". There's many aspects to being a quality employee, and taking care of your equipment should be one of them. Replacing one expensive laptop for a high performer isn't a big deal. Replacing ten or fifteen in the course a few years is another story. The devil, as always, is in the details.

Also, you need the backing of someone with the authority to fire people, but that doesn't necessarily mean that firing will be the first, or third, option, only the last. It has to be in the background, but there are a lot of other approaches it can back up (like ""avoidable expense"" deductions to bonuses).

Another option that shows up a lot in other contexts is the PIP - the Performance Improvement Plan. You tell them flat out ""You're not meeting the requirements of the job in these ways (referring to the written policy on taking care of equipment), and these are the specific improvements you need to make or we'll have to let you go, and this is how we'll measure those improvements."" And if they don't improve, it's no longer about the original criteria, it's about challenging the authority of someone who can fire you.

"Right? This is especially egregious in silicon valley. And the insane thing is, *Silicon Valley is aboard this train.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Former Google CEO and chairman Eric Schmidt is quoted ""I don’t know how you build great management \[with remote work\]. I honestly don’t""

  
The fucking chutzpah.   
Look, I expect this kind of thing from your widget companies and your brick-and-mortar operations, but this whole Silicon Valley obsession with local work is fucking absurd. We're talking about an industry that has become arguably the largest on the planet *thanks to their decoupling of information and interaction from physical proximity.*  

  
Let me repeat that, because it goddamn bears repeating. 

  
This is an industry that has become ridiculously prosperous and powerful **because they offer people a way to interact with each other anywhere.** 

  
Google/Alphabet, for instance, has made their name as the advertising king of the internet (which means that they help many sites, including this one, fund themselves), and of course they also have hands in mobile operating systems, VOIP, a web browser (complete with remote-access solution), fiber internet, self-driving cars, and others. What's the common thread, here? These are all technologies enabling an internet-based economy which is largely independent of location.  Ditto for Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, you name it. We call it the information age, but it could just as easily be called the location-agnostic age. 

  
Sorry, I'm just having trouble conveying just how fucking bonkers this seems to me. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills! Read the original quote again. This is like.... fucking Henry Ford saying  ""cars are a fun toy, but horses are how actual work gets done.""

"tl:dr: Hiring is extremely time consuming and hard. 

I spent much of last year interviewing T1 and T2 SD reps for a remote ('for now') position out of Phoenix, which has a very healthy IT workforce. After entirely too long, we decided on 12 (6 T1/ 6 T2) and weren't entirely happy with some of them. Of the T2's we made an offer to, only 1 accepted. Of the T1's we made an offer to, 5 accepted, but only 2 had any significant IT experience. 

Took us *months* to eek that out. I was pulled away from my actual job - which wasn't cheap - to help coordinate and facilitate all that + training which was at half capacity anyway. Later on the company cut heavy corners with both hiring and training: accepting people we wouldn't have considered the first round, and not investing significantly into their onboarding. The results were drastic over the rest of that year. I left recently with that whole team in shambles and rapidly getting worse. There was further talk every day of the existing techs leaving when return to office was forced. I fully believe many of them will. The company isn't in a position to do all this again, it's going to cripple IT severely.",1649715520,sysadmin,OrphanScript,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15l5m/fortune_says_remote_work_is_over/i4cn5u8/

"Yeah, it's not going to be good for commercial real estate. It's not like you can easily repurpose those generic 100 acre suburban campus buildings either...it'll be very similar to what's happening to malls today.

I think the time has passed where most companies want ""the IBM Building"" or ""the Sears Tower"" or ""Apple Park"" or whatever. They don't have a massive workforce to house anymore, they don't want to put paper-pusher jobs that would fill a building in a big city, and there's less emphasis on real-estate based prestige.

Early in my career (like the 90s) I worked for a big life insurance company in NYC that still owns a massive commercial office portfolio both in NYC and elsewhere. (Life insurance companies are the last companies who own anything; they need stable reserves to pay premiums.) Back then, the then-old timers were telling me about how the building we were in (two connected super-tall buildings each a full city block) was filled to capacity with thousands and thousands of manual paper-pushers and file clerks...and at the time I was there there was huge amounts of room.

"If you get really proficient in powershell, you can automate things that wouldn't have even been feasible to do manually in the first place.

For example, I have a powershell script that kicks off every two minutes.  

In those two minutes, it:

1. Connects to half a dozen SQL clusters
2. Queries their extended event session for sql wait events
3. Parses out each distinct wait event
4. Strings together some ad-hoc queries to enrich the data with things like database names and stored procedure names
5. Spits out a more friendly json file with a list of long wait events, what resource the lock was on, what workstation/app/SP caused the lock, same data for what was effected by the lock.

This JSON is then consumed by filebeat and sent to an ELK stack instance which produces dashboards and automated alerting on long-lived locks with enough contextual data to drill down and give developers an optimization target.

But a session can be established by a link on our website can get a person connected to either a general pool or to a specific agent(and it also shows which agents are currently online, but our setup was made a bit prettier than stock by our web developer). The connection itself, from the web agent will start with user privileges and you can elevate to admin either with the user acknolaging that it's ok with a windows security prompt(or it just works if UAC's been disabled) or with a username/password from your end.

For persistence you can make the one time sessions a permanent one(with whatever elevation you happen to be in at the time). Or you can push a dedicated installer out with a few options(things like if you want it to try and auto elevate on install or what group to put the computer into.

The only real issue, at least for the version we used, would be the licensing. It's all based on agents. It worked for us, but for people that might want to deploy it as a team viewer style remote work app would be horrified at the cost(I *think* they might have something else for that but I've never looked into it).

Honestly the thing I like most about it wasn't about how flexible it was(and it was, it has so many options how how to deploy, or set up agents, it's crazy compared to competitors), it was how it *just* *worked*. Rare was the time that a computer had internet that you couldn't get it to deploy. Or if it was deployed that you couldn't connect. And the file transfer, goodness, compared to other apps, it might be worth it to have it just for that, it's so stupid simple but it never seems to have trouble getting a file across(I've had a handful of times where every other protocol and program will fail a transfer after a time but it would succeed, I have no idea why).

"When the VAR relationship works well it can really be a plus for both buyer and partner.

I've spent the bulk of my career on the buyer side, but did do 6 years as an SE for some well know cybersecurity companies.  From a buyer's perspective a VAR can really be a nice single point of contact. Let's say I'm looking at something like endpoint protection or a firewall upgrade. If I have a good VAR they will hopefully have a relationship with the major players in that space and can save me a lot of time figuring out if there's one clear better choice for my needs instead of me having to give out my info to 4-5 vendors and having them now SPAM the crap out of me. 

There is a level of trust needed though. I need to trust that my VAR really does have the best options for me and they aren't just going to steer me to the one that gives them the highest margin. I've dealt with quite a few who were 100% transparent about those things because they didn't want to jeopardize the longer term relationship.

"I hate to agree with the article, but I do think they're right. At the first whiff of a recession, employers are going to pull back every single inch of ground they've given employees. People forget that ""tech companies"" like the FAANGs and Microsoft print money and are in a fierce battle to attract and keep the best people on Earth. Only recently has that begun to spill over into other companies that are just ""users of tech."" I don't expect I'll keep my current arrangement (one day a week in the office, long commute but fine since it's only one day.) I also don't expect anyone else will long-term either.

Anyone declaring that this time it's different, they're part of the technerati, or whatever, hasn't seen what happens when the economy flips from amazing to horrible. We've been in a protracted expansionary period (at least in IT/technology) since 2009 or so. Companies have barely had to pay to borrow money, they're practically begging their cloud overlords to please please migrate and lock up their workloads, and there are tons of companies in FOMO mode trying to outdo one another. Eventually, companies will flip back to survival mode and IMO it's going to be a painful adjustment. Last time this happened (2001) there was massive offshoring and job cuts...I see the same once all the cloud providers own everyone's infrastructure. Lots of businesses who were just sponging off the near-zero borrowing costs or living off the stock/fintech/crypto bubble won't survive.

Enjoy it while it lasts...provide huge value to your employer and be the one they're willing to make exceptions for...just don't assume you're untouchable.

"I can kind of understand why from Microsoft's point of view.

The more users MS can get out of their sunsetting OS before the end date, the easier it will be for them to drop support once the deadline comes without much of a ruckus. But, we've all dealt with users who will not EVER install any kind of update unless somehow forced. Even if it's for their own good.

So we either have tactics like this, or we end up with botnets running unsupported OSes full of stubborn users. Microsoft is really sick and tired of seeing headlines about how unsecure their OSes are (without context that these OSes haven't been supported and users had years of warning). So, now we're at the point of MS taking off the kid gloves and cramming it down our throats.

"Two Things:

* Never underestimate the power of allowing almost anyone to complete a task with perfect precision in a very rapid manner. 
* Some time is worth more then other time. 

People tend to get caught in the idea of automating to save time directly, and so they assume if something takes an hour to automate, and saves you 5 minutes it needs to be done 12 times or you have wasted time. But not all things are this way. 

Some things are automated for precision. You want to ensure a task gets done the exact same way every time, over and over and over. Even if the running of that task took longer then doing it by hand you would still spend time automating it for a loss of efficiency. 

**Example:** A machine that made waffles. It takes 11 minutes to make a perfect waffle, you take 9 minutes to sometimes make a perfect waffle. 

Some things are automated because the time you spend now matter less then the time it saves later. Imagine a script that took you 5 days to write and would save you 5 minutes. But the 5 days it cost you was all during periods of zero issues, no outages, and little work.  And the 5 minutes was during the more important 5 minutes in company issue where the systems working meant billions in profits.",1649709145,sysadmin,mrbiggbrain,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15rz8/do_you_use_powershell_a_lot/i4c6xuw/

I plan to not care about stuff if the org doesn't care, but I'll share the list officially with the associated risk.

"This is the other half of the remote work piece I've been wondering about. We have talked ad nauseum about ""work"" from home and how workers have adapted or struggled to adapt to remote work. What I haven't seen has been any great discussion on ""manage"" from home struggles. I've been 100% remote for over 12 years so when the remote thing hit because of covid, nothing changed for me. My team and our managers were used to it, so business as usual. Other teams? Not so much. I'm aware of teams that had to do daily video stand-ups that honestly served no other purpose than to accommodate the void their manager felt at not being able to stare out his office door and gaze upon his cubicle kingdom. He may not have spoken to them in the office but once a week, but at least he SAW them daily and needed that visual cue to know they were really doing their work, deadlines and goals being met be damned. I've heard of other teams having an open group call they all dial into for the day to simulate working in the same room. That is totally management not adapting but at the end of the day, management will trump workers, at least in the short term. So if an entire ""generation"" of management struggled with remote work, it's no surprise they are chomping at the bit to get back to the old ways. It's their comfort zone. It's a shame because it was an opportunity for a fundamental sea change and maybe stop doing things the same old way we've been doing them since the industrial revolution.I guess all those goofy ""who moved my cheese"" type motivational quotes about how you will never succeed or excel unless you live outside your comfort zone only applies to the plebes receiving the pep talk not the ones actually giving it.",1649708371,sysadmin,dbl_edged,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15l5m/fortune_says_remote_work_is_over/i4c4w6p/

What working remote showed everyone is that there is no need for managers. Remote workers can manage themselves and get work done in a very efficient manner. Maybe I should say the style of managers or management that existed before the pandemic is what is not needed. Management should be the buffer between the customer and the employee. They should make sure the employee has all the things they need to do the work and stop customers from coming to the employee directly. They should get all the requirements and be able to communicate them to the employee while knowing what is already on their plate and not overburdening the employee. The manager should also be the first one to say no to any non-critical work that is not part of the current projects being worked on. In any management or upper management meetings the manager should sing the praises of his employees.,1649705409,sysadmin,grantnaps,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15l5m/fortune_says_remote_work_is_over/i4bxge6/

Tickets resolved x average response time x average ticket rating.

I think they are right. I have a job, but am looking for a new one and I see fewer and fewer remote opportunities. I see a lot of hybrid opportunities, but that will likely start being more days in the office and fewer at home.

"My goal is to save ***at least*** as much as I cost annually.  For the last twenty years, with two exceptions, I've hit that number every year.

There are dozens, hundreds of ways.  Squeezing down telecom/printing costs, automation of labor intensive processes, developing hardware replacement cycles that eliminate unplanned downtime (also, introducing the concept of ***planned*** downtime to actually perform maintenance tasks so that you reduce outages), standardized hardware configurations imaging and/or build tools.

**Time** is always going to be your biggest cost savings.  It's amazing how much a labor hour costs when you add up all the overhead.  Use that to your advantage.  One FTE is 2080 hours, calculate ROI at 3-5 years gives you &gt;6k or &gt;10k hours, so even at a relatively cheap $50/hr, preventing the need to hire another body can easily translate to $500k.",1649700890,sysadmin,ddadopt,/r/sysadmin/comments/u1b7br/what_are_some_ways_that_you_helped_your_company/i4bpa8y/

In my experience having good relations with management from in-office schmoozing doesn't save you from being RIF'd either. I've disabled more accounts of management bootlickers than I can count. On top of that IT is hard to replace and less likely to be cut (barring specific scenarios like an acquisition/merger), and it's easier for someone with IT experience to find a new job than many other professions.

"MsMpEng.exe on Server 2019/2022.  Anyone else seeing it suddenly eat up memory like Cookie Monster on cookies?  Started getting memory alerts across all Windows hosts Saturday evening, hasn't let up since.  Reboots, no help, give it a few minutes and MsMpEng will be eating up 1GB+ of memory.  Definition Updates?  I thought that had helped, and got a reprieve from the alerts but lo, they're back and no updates are pending.

Hosts are all fully patched/updated, have run the exact workloads they're running today for months and months, event-free.  Their memory graphs are a nice flat line (these are all non-domain joined service nodes, only job is to run various internally developed services/reports). A nice flat line, that is, until MsMpEng decided that RAM is delicious this weekend.

The services they run are in a specific path, and that path is added via 'Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath &lt;path&gt;', and nothing else is installed on these hosts. Docs for Set-MpPreference say everything under ExclusionPath (processes and files) is 100% ignored by Defender.  So all MsMpEng is monitoring is a pure default Windows Server installation, unless these recent updates have broken something and it no longer respects ExclusionPath.

Still working through things, and rebooting hosts once MsMpEng is using over 1.5GB of RAM (prior to this weekend, it'd run its normal 180MB-ish size across all hosts, for weeks with no bloat/issue at all).

"I can relate to how things get trickier once you factor in multiple time zones. Our lives were so much easier before we increased our international business. It was bad enough needing to add a few hours for West Coast. 

Those people have a legit problem but am I really expected to be on call 24/7 for end user issues? People in my own time zone aren’t allowed to text me at 10:00 PM for a basic issue so that goes for other time zones as well. Personally, I don’t want any end users ever texting me, even during business hours. 

Ultimately, I think you need to spell it out for this guy. He needs to open tickets and the clock on any ticket starts when YOUR workday starts. That will likely mean that all of his tickets may be a day old before you even read them.

"Seems like people are violently disagreeing about the same thing.

The job evolves. I think it should be clear by now that a lot of the traditional work done 20 years ago in maintaining servers and services isn't happening the same way. And not needing to do X doesn't mean that you do nothing, it means that you do more of Y and Z, or it means you can do X better.

Running an in house mail server meant managing the hardware, the redundancies, network connections, backups, spam filtering as well as practical things like provisioning accounts, setting up shared email addresses, hardware refreshes, software updates and upgrades and all that grunt work. In small businesses, a lot of that wasn't done or wasn't done well. It's been pretty easy to buy in mail services, and with much cheaper storage and more bandwidth it usually works out cheaper for a better service. Mail services scale *really* well, especially all that background stuff like hardware, security, spam, back ups, software updates etc. Scaling very much does mean fewer people are needed to look after mail.

So what do companies do now? Well, they get their sys admins to do different stuff since they are doing less mail ""stuff"". And that different stuff might be automating and integrating and orchestrating, so that there's even less of the hands on grunt work, and some tasks might even be done by HR pushing a button for ""provision new hire"" and it all ""happens"".

Mail is a relatively small change.

Something a bit bigger is the shift from fileshares to collaboration in the cloud, where documents aren't saved on a file server in 57 different edits in different folders with different permissions, but are ""just there"" on a cloud service where multiple people can easily work on a document together. That also means a cultural shift in the organisation. But it can mean that the need for file server disappears entirely in some organisations.

So, yeah, a sys admin will learn more about cloud services, about the specific concerns of using cloud services, and probably a lot more about coding, APIs, integration and automation. But organisations will still want someone to help *them* use these systems to do what *they* need to do.

"We said goodbye to WSUS and other third party patching software a few years back.  I've worked with WSUS, SolarWinds Patch Manager, BMC Asset Core, PDQ Deploy, and some others.  These solutions will always require dedicated people to maintain, approve, and deploy updates.  Plus, you're almost guaranteed to miss something, because Microsoft likes to make patching complicated and doesn't always include things like .NET framework or Windows Defender updates in their cumulative packages.  We decided to leverage the PSWindowsUpdate Powershell module instead.  Using this module is akin to clicking the ""Check for Updates"" button.  The device itself contacts Microsoft directly then downloads and installs the patches it needs.  There is no need to pre-approve or schedule deployments.  This method also picks-up things like .NET Framework, Windows Defender, and some other third-party updates for things like Firefox or Office365.  You can use a program like PDQ Deploy or setup scheduled task in Group Policy to kick-off the Powershell command at your desired time.  It will save you so much time.

c- INFRA (request rollback of s3 or whatever they use, dates and locations)  
d- AWS support if needed

"Results based management. For each task or each project set expectations, timelines and expected deliverables and communicate them clearly with your subordinates. Judge them by how well they meet these deliverables.

If your subordinates are unable to meet your deliverables, have clear and focused conversations with those individuals to understand what you can do to help them meet those goals without being confrontational.

Unless you are managing a group that bills time to customers, don't ever ask them how long they spend on a particular task. 

Always be available to answer questions and make sure everyone understands that you are there to help them.

Don't let people from outside your group or upper management engage your subordinates directly. Make sure to implement a ticketing system or project management system that will better allow you to help people engage the correct resources.

Don't be afraid to fail. And don't ever be afraid to tell your own subordinates that you screwed up so that they also feel empowered to admit mistakes to you.

I can see some extenuating circumstances where I'd take a job that required my presence 5 days a week, but I can't see any circumstance where I wouldn't be looking for a remote or hybrid job the entire time I was there.

If you're not at least hybrid you're going to *bleed* talent. And have a hard time finding any.

The MSP actually blocked Git and other tools via AppLocker, because they wanted their guys overseas to have the development.

The fix?  A huge shadow IT department.  Computers were bought as ""dongles for software to enable it to run"", routers and such were bought as part of the computer purchase, a deal was made with a restaurant that they would get a free, high bandwidth Internet pipe, if they ignored the CAT 6 cord plugged into their router, and the DevOps team worked on a network completely separated from the company network, and the laptops for it stashed in desk drawers, just in case the MSP decided to pay a visit (they tended to not to, and things like enabling a port on a router could take weeks, because they looked for a subcontractor to do it locally.)  This worked perfectly, and I still don't know how the manager ""laundered"" the deliverables to the company network, especially with the MSP doing everything they can to throw roadblocks in the path, be it setting max number of MACs to 1 on a VMWare cluster's trunk, not bothering to do `wr mem` so if a router reboots, it means a service call, and other nasty stuff.  Corporate didn't care, because they were so insulated from it, and loved the ""ROI"" the offshored MSP was giving them.

"We use Ivanti Security Controls in our environment.  It's a nice all around update tool.  We get Windows and a lot of third party updates through it.  You can go agentless patching for things that remain on prem (it also has VMware tie ins if you want to patch your VMs) but for your use case scenario it has an agent that can be installed on machines.  Said agent will then communicate with the main server to coordinate updates, and then, depending on how you set up groups/jobs it will download said updates from either your local server or directly from the vendor on the internet.

For workstations we've got it set up where anything at our main office hits the main Ivanti server.  We've got cache servers at various satellite offices that machines local to those offices will grab updates from.  Finally anything WFH will grab patches directly from the vendor.  It works well for us and about the only time there's an issue is when somebody doesn't turn on a computer for a while and it's way behind on updates.

Some folks bash Ivanti, but I do think it depends on which product you get from them.  Security Controls, from my use case, works pretty damn well.

"&gt;Made me want to ask this community - was remote-work a thing in your organization, before covid?

Not really.  We had one person that I know of who worked 1 day per week in the office, otherwise they were remote.  We had the infrastructure for remote work, we just didn't do it.  We have a very old school mindset for a lot of things.

That said, we have transitioned to a full choose-your-own adventure (department/manager permitting).  IT is now 90% or so fully remote, the rest being hybrid or fully in-office.  It's very nice.  Management saw the productivity increase and decided to save money by not extending our lease on one of the floors we were using.  They dumped some money into the remaining floor to spruce it up, and re-organize it for having less people and more hotel cubes/collaboration spaces.

My previous job was at a small MSP, where I wore all the hats (remote management, on-site projects, sales, etc).  We didn't have issues with occasional remote work, but generally I was either in the office or at a customer site.  I started working more remotely when it snowed even a little (no reason to suffer through stupidity on the highway) or when I needed less distraction.

I am pretty happy with my current situation.  I'm ""fully"" remote, meaning I have no permanent desk at the office, but I still go in to work in the datacenter as needed.

Them I discovered that one of our developers was complaining his system was slow and would stop receive new connections after only 100 users logged in. The old system I managed was fine with over 4000 connections.  
This is because I didn´t gave him a server only a VM to work on and the old system had a physical server only for him.  
I gave him a 8 core 8GB RAM and 300GB SSD VM, the old server was a HP DL380 G5.  
So they bought for him a HP DL360 G9 with Six core with 8GB of RAM.  
Still the system would stop receive new connectios after only 100 users logged in and was really slow. Like with 80 users would take 10s to change a single page.  


After some fingers being pointed I have the permission to see what the problem was.

"You are assuming our bad regulation was created in a vacuum free from powerful special interest meddling. Don't get me wrong, regulations can be a disaster. I'm aware many regulations we have are very bad or aimless. 

But that doesn't mean regulations are the problem...it means the humans making them are. Our garbage regulations that don't seem to help only hamper are a direct result of being influenced by lobbyists at every level of government. 

The reason our tax code is 1000s of pages long is BECAUSE of corporations. You should look into countries that don't have a ""for profit"" industry stapled to their tax revenue. Their tax code is short and concise. You don't have to pay a for-profit company that lobbied the government to make the tax code MORE confusing to handle things for you.

My point is that you are right, there are so many useless regulations out there. But when you start pulling threads you will find many of them were created with the intent to create a profit center, at the expense of the consumer. 

This is exactly what I mean when I say that corporations are writing the laws themselves and thats why they are so bad. Intuit/Turbotax got the laws written and overcomlicated through years of meddling in the government. When well-informed people, not profits, write legislation then you tend to get much better results from 100s of laws. Instead we have an automotive emissions restriction that makes automotive emissions worse. I wonder if there was an industry at risk when that law was written? Corporations for 100s of years have been claiming that making them follow the rules will destroy them. If that was true we would either still have 18 hr a day child labrorers, or corporations would be no more.

I only do it because I have 100% control over all projects and client messaging. No bloody middle managers in the way. I do have staff that cameo with me sometimes. I basically tell them they are happy to help me when they want but they mostly stay away because it's ""too hard"" and it's catastrophic to the entire company when things go wrong. I have a long IT history. Helpdesk for 20,000 people in the 90s, UNIX sysadmin during the IT bubble, software developer, security guy/network admin during the 2000s, most recently project manager, analyst and low code developer. Done accounting, legal (negotiate and write contracts), I've done engineering (quasi, since I can't stamp it... but literally that's all the engineers do), etc, etc. I've done all these things, usually to support an IT project of some sort.

"I bring my laptop to Interviews and either show them executed output of code I’ve written or actually execute it in front of them. Im not trying to be cocky here at all, but when you have over 20 years of experience as I do, it’s easy to show them. For example, I wrote an automated DNS update process where you drop a CSV in a shared folder, limited with privs, and the code I wrote would digest the CSV at an idempotent level (ie if forward was there it just added reverse, and vice versa), find any potential extra entries with the same IP/fqdn, then Email the creator of the CSV by AD lookup with a report of all the above, as well as success/failures. This was in a multi domain environment without trusts. I actually wrote a DNS powershell module as the core of this whole thing, forward are easy, reverse records can be a huge pain, especially if the zones weren’t setup properly, and therefore I had logic to find the most granular reverse zone, In the event the reverse record could be placed Into multiple zones. 

The whole impetus for doing the above was to allow the Unix side of the company access to manage their own DNS records without any access to AD directly. If you’ve ever been In A large Fortune 500 level company, this is pretty standard separation and if you’ve ever been in that type of env, there some strong rivalries.

"Agreed with both. There are jobs in the field where a company can get away with, for lack of a better phrase, bringing in newer/inexperienced hires for a low salary, because it's a ""learning experience"" or however they try to sell it. People will cycle out of the company most likely, for better paying roles, but that's fine; there's always people new to the field waiting for that first chance.

Also, the longer you stay in the situation, the worse it gets for you. I've listened to plenty of YouTubers and podcasters regarding professional advice, and one common theme has been ""don't ask for or expect a huge raise."" It's disruptive, and will make you less favorable in all likelihood if you are successful in negotiation, although yes there are exceptions. Companies want people to be quiet, while saying you can air your grievances which typically come back to haunt you.

"Unfortunately, you are looking at just the tip of the ice berg. The real problem, in IT and elsewhere, is that we have bad managers. Too often people are promoted because they are so good at doing the work they need a raise and the only way to do that is to make them managers. Just because you are good at the work, does not mean you are good at managing people. Add on to that the perspective of so many that managers should learn by fire or just do what their manager did and we perpetuate bad managerial ideas. So few companies have ""rising manager training"" and not many more have ""so you are a manager now"" training. 

Is it any wonder that people who know how to do a task but not communicate with people are bad at measuring and managing people from a distance? This claim that ""remote is the problem"" overlooks that too often these same managers can't manage any better in person.

Until we as an industry and as a whole change how we do things we will continue to be frustrated, fail, and burn people out. To be clear, no I am not saying MBA's are the answer as they often lack the same people skills, but are just better at looking at broad ideas and numbers. 

What is needed is actual people managers, training on what it means to become a manager, promotion paths for high performers that don't require them to manage people (especially when they are bad at it), and training for managers to improve and drive people skills. Learning that conflict is not bad unless it is not constructive is huge. So many mangers are afraid to tell someone ""this is what you need accomplish, and you are failing to do so"" until it is a critical issue and then they blow up. This idea that ""people should know"" and ""well that is how I learned"" is just crap. We don't believe in common sense in users why should be believe in it in staff interpersonal skills?

"I'd argue most regulations are entirely unnecessary.  Cumulatively between Federal, State, and local/municipal laws, codes, rules, taxes, and regulations there are likely to be quite literally millions of various draconian rules imposed on corporations and sole proprietorships and the like.  And I'm not necessarily referring to massive corporations like Microsoft or Amazon but think about for example a guy who is incorporated and fixes cars.  That dude has to comply with numerous laws and regulations and pays a ton of taxes just for the privilege of doing business.  

  
Years ago I took a trip to Greenville, SC and walked through the what I thought I was the very nice downtown.  The river - Reedy? I'm probably not remembering it properly - that runs through downtown is quite nice and there is a lot of activity, restaurants, cafes, an amateur league baseball field, etc.  

  
In the early part of the 20th Century and possible later 19th C. that river had textile dyes dumped copiously into that now-beautiful river and charming downtown area, effectively poisoning the river for decades.

  
Thankfully the City of Greenville elected to save the river and radically gentrify the downtown area that was once crowded with derelict textile warehouses and buildings.  It's a credit to the City to have that much vision. 

  
Anyway, all this to say am I glad there were rules and regulations to stop the poisoning of, for example, waterways?  Of course.  There have sadly been countless waterways - rivers, lakes, ponds, etc. - poisoned over the last 100+ years in the US and of course around the world there are still many many places where waterways, groundwater, and just general ground poisoned by terrible toxic chemicals like arsenic, heavy metals, etc.   Even the US Government - perhaps especially the US Govt - often did such things with impunity even if now their various three-letter agencies enforce laws that are designed to prevent such things from ever happening again. 

  
Will corporations, mega or otherwise, often act in their own self interest in the pursuit of profits?  Exploit workers, poison ground and waterways, flaunt rules and laws and regulations and skirt regulations designed to protect workers?  Absolutely.  

  
Regardless whatever they are doing they are doing it not because of the lack of  laws, rules, codes, and regulations.  So yea to me that doesn't seem particular healthy just as having what 100s of 1000s of pages of tax code doesn't seem particular useful or healthy.  

  
I also don't have any solutions for the various reasons you're hinting at - the continual poking and prodding and changing and altering of laws to serve various companies and interests and quite often to serve some politically or ideologically-motivated cause.  Politicians certainly have been known to do things to justify their existence and jobs.",1649689595,sysadmin,boethius70,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15l5m/fortune_says_remote_work_is_over/i4aw3cu/

&gt;Hybrid I can understand.  Come in a couple of days a week, sure, I get that.  
&gt;  
&gt;But beyond that, it's a very binary thing.  You're either expected to be in the office or you're not.   And if I'm commuting 2 hours a day (an hour each way) with UK fuel prices as they are, to me that's worth about £10-12k/year.

&gt;So - them's your options.  Pay an extra £10-12k for staff or accept they're not coming in every day.

"That makes sense.

My main conflict was you saying you have more degrees than a thermometer, then saying all academics was is memorizing facts and taking tests - which I know from experience is very much a cert thing and also from experience, very much not a graduate school thing.

Many modern undergraduate programs have expanded to include more complex work now, and the general progression of academics is fundamental theory, modern theory and practice, advanced theory, research and development.

Your typical new grad will have a bit more experience than previous generations, and even masters level now is often a partial mix of MBA which often require business partnership for capstones… but that varies depending on if the program is research or application focused (if it’s terminal or not).

All I am saying is that it’s pretty evident when someone is out of touch with current academic rigor, and it’s probably not a great idea to judge academic merit from that position. I made a guess on your certs because a lot of entry level are not useful, and I find people that have a couple of those will use that as a standard to judge all of them, which isn’t appropriate. Cert quality and usefulness varies wildly because it’s not standardized or regulated.

I think your stance is a dangerous precedent for future operation. Percentage of degree holders year over year continues to increase, even advanced degree holders are becoming more common. If you guide people into a career dismissing the importance of education, where it is becoming common to require a degree, you can be setting people up for a lot of stress and possibly failure in the future.

Things change, and tech is still relatively young. When organizations catch on that having a poorly educated IT department can cost them a ton of money through vulnerabilities or ineffectiveness, it’s going to become more and more normalized to require candidates to hold degrees.",1649688358,sysadmin,Typical-Ad-6042,/r/sysadmin/comments/u0ww55/is_a_masters_degree_worth_it/i4at1jw/

"I'm not very unfamiliar with this particular incident but I do work in the backups sector.

Usually you'll have multiple copies of your backups, 1 onsite in whatever dedicated storage for quick restores. One offsite (cloud or another datacenter or something) in case the entire primary site goes down (think 'fire in the server room' or 'really bad cryptolocker attack'), and then one in long-term storage like tape stored at a long-term-storage facility (amazon glacier, iron mountain, etc), and those are used basically when absolutely everything is completely fucked - like if you need to roll back the *entire organization* back to a certain point. Usually the case in the most fucked cryptolocker attacks (usually requires a really nasty virus *plus* bad security practices).

Of course, this all assumes good practices are being followed, and in my experience, best practices are simply not followed by a lot of people.

"&gt;  I know there's a philosophy of ""everything should handle text input/output"" in Unix/Linux, but I think PowerShell's object pipeline has shown there are better ways to do it.  

Well it's a platform thing, right?  In Unix/Linux everything is a file.  All settings and configurations come down to some formatted text someplace.  So text input/output makes sense.  

But in Windows you're always dealing with the OS API layer.  Configuration is controlled by the Registry or other non-text based controls.  So text input/output won't get you too far in the Windows world.  Really, this is one of the brilliant things about Powershell.  It treats everything as .Net objects and yeah, passes them down the pipeline.  But I don't know if that would be such an advantage in Unix/Linux.  There are times when I see how it could be (I have to parse out the pid to pass to the kill command, can't just send the object to kill) but overall it doesn't fit the paradigm.

"Did you solve this issue? I have this with every Win10 version when I want to sysprep it into an image. In my experience something which worked for the win10 version before, did not work anymore with the new one as the policies for updating store apps changed. Best would be as someone mentioned to do it via a VM, but if you can't out of reasons, here is what worked for me. 

It was a collection of things, some which have been mentioned here already, and maybe some you did already, but anyway: 

1. offline and in audit mode
2. disable fast boot and secure boot
3. disable encryption, e.g. Bitlocker
4. local admin account activated - no password
5. deactivate Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service
6. activate windows (maybe not necessary)

Even while preparing an image in audit mode offline, I had store related issues which were not evidently logged in pantherr. I would recommend using before you finalize your image and sysprep to remove the storeapps. I use in PS:

`Get-appxprovisionedpackage –online | where-object {$_.packagename –notlike '*store*'} | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -online`

`Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | where-object {$_.name –notlike '*store*'} | Remove-AppxPackage`

`Get-appxprovisionedpackage –online | where-object {$_.packagename –notlike '*store*'} | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -online`

If there is an error afterwards, check as already mentioned here in pantherr log and remove that app manually via above PS line.

i personally don't use it a lot, however the size of your company likely matters a lot.

found their logfile on my system, found the error in there. looked for a powershell example to monitor a text file for changes. the one i found simply spit out a single line saying the file was modified then terminated. threw that logic into a ""while ($true)"" loop, added some lines to reset the variables their sleep/print was using to detect changes, added my own if statement looking for ""*broken connection*"" and then had it run procdump64 on the vendor's program if it found it.

being comfortable enough with powershell to be able to look at code samples, **understand** what they're doing, and modifying them is a very useful skill. (this should go without saying, but don't run code that you don't understand).

looking forward, powershell could become MUCH more important in the future as more and more things transition to the cloud, since powershell is naturally going to be more relevant with azure than the kind of on prem stuff i typically deal with. since you say you're ""new to IT"", i'm going to assume that also is code for ""young"". being comfortable with powershell would probably be a worthwhile investment.",1649686836,sysadmin,reaper527,/r/sysadmin/comments/u15rz8/do_you_use_powershell_a_lot/i4apc2w/

Look at the US auto industry. The cries for environmental regulation were answered decades ago. The laws were so poorly chopped up that it has caused the opposite of what we wanted. Because the law was made to judge fuel efficiency on the basis of vehicle size then we get larger and larger vehicles sucking up more and more fuel.

"They acknowledged inflation?!

Most folks here still got the standard ""no more than 2.5%, but usually not that much and commonly bit less than inflation"" raises they been doing for a dozen years since our division was bought by $corporateOverlords.  I'm sure we have among the highest pay in purchasing power parity terms among all the divisions around the world; but we're also the most profitable division on a percentage basis.

I was in a group of 10% of IT employees who got the ""extra special pretty please don't leave"" 5% raise this year.

I'm 52, and I'm younger than 2/3rds of the IT staff.  They're clearly having persistent issues attracting and especially retaining younger staff.

(I did express sufficient displeasure that I've since gotten another 6%-ish; I still feel a bit under paid but they're getting close enough one promotion and small 4-5% raise would actually get me comfortable saying, ""Yep, I can stay here another 10 years and know I can comfortably retire if I need to.""  In my case, I see cloud initiatives being done at the $corporateOverlords level while the division is focused on on-prem legacy x86 infrastructure -- i.e. there is a big risk I could get laid off in my early 60s as that on-prem stuff goes away and have little practical cloud experience.

"This is mainly copypasta from my reply in another thread, but I've added to it.  


I've been remote working for 11-12 years.

Started off working for a company which was in a different country and over 60% of their workforce was remote. As we provided outsourced support it meant our 'office hours' were 24hrs a day as our teams chased the sun. I spent two weeks in the office to collect my equipment and meet the management team. After that, it was 100% remote for the 2 years I was with them. We had regular voice-chat meetings, video wasn't as big a thing back then, but we still got on well and just made sure that our documentation and processes were strong so that we could hand-off without worrying.

More recently, I worked for a mobile game developer. We were remote apart from meeting once a week. Being a small team of 16 it was easy to develop a relationship as we were all effectively departments of 1, so our own roles and responsibilities were easy to define.

My current role, I joined in August 2020, right in the middle of the pandemic.  I was interviewed and started my job without physically meeting any of me colleagues or the c-level team. It wasn't until I'd been there 3 or 4 months that we managed to meet up with anyone.

Since then, I've been remote and have only been into the office a handful of times. Even now that the office is open and we're being encouraged to go in twice a week, I've not gone in (and it looks like few others have to based on how quiet it is when I DO go in).  But in my case, the team I manage are based in Romania and Ukraine. My own superiors and the other dept managers are all based in Malta or Romania, so it wouldn't really matter where I was, office or at home, I'd still be working on Teams or Slack using video calls with everyone anyway.

We have met up a few times, and we've had a few days in Malta to thrash some things out face to face, and sometimes that IS what's needed. But for the day-to-day, remote works just as well for us.

I often say, don't consider a Teams or Slack call as some official, formal communication.  Consider it no different from someone tapping you on the shoulder while you're at your desk to bend your ear for 5 minutes.  Get into seeing it in that informal nature and it becomes easier.

A call is not something to be feared as a request for work or some heavy handed management spying on you, it can literally  be a ""hi, how you doing, how was your weekend"" sort of thing.  We do it on Social Media with our friends, so can we not translate that same level of informality  into our work environment?

I'm just as, if not more productive working from home. I'll often do bits and pieces at odd hours of the day or even at the weekend if something comes to mind and I'm not doing anything else.

If anything falls over, I can be far more responsive 'out of hours' with my full working environment at my fingertips.

For me, I can do the school run with my son and so spend more time with him.  
BUT, and I think there is a big but, I made the decision to go remote and so set up a defined working environment. I had a conservatory built on the back off the house which became my office. In there I have my desk,. filing cabinet, big screen, laptop stand, headset, speakers, decent chair and the ability to close the door to the main house. The door serves two purposes : keeps me separate when I'm working if I need to be, so no distractions or noise from the house, but also enables me to close the door on the office when I'm finished.

For those who've had WFH imposed upon them by Covid, and who don't have that dedicated work environment, nor have had time to set one up and get used to it, I can imagine it IS harder to be more productive when you're relying being sat at the table in the dining room, or worse still, on your lap on the sofa. Moreso if you're a family and more than one of you is WFH and competing for space and resources.

So IMHO, if it's done right remote working certainly doesn't diminish, and can help improve productivity, but I don't think anyone can say it's always going to be the case",1649686139,sysadmin,kickingtyres,/r/sysadmin/comments/u181ww/lets_talk_about_remote_work/i4anngp/

True, let us have the option to either come in or WFH. Problem solved.

Source: trust me bro. My company is posting record numbers, and posted record numbers during peak WFH.

"These are very good questions, and there are six decades worth of books trying to answer them.

TL;DR; Stability, Agility, Cost-effectiveness. Pick two.

You will see that across the decades, shifting paradigms have been popularized, trying to solve the issue of maintainability.

Common themes include monolithic VS distributed responsibility in components, strict VS loose processes, to refactor or not, and many others. You will see them come and go in waves.

The new paradigm is about solving the issues with the present one. Which leads to re-introducing the issues the present one solved.

Good advice is to never listen to anyone religiously promoting the current paradigm. DevOps is the answer to everything!!! Nah, mate, there are good things about it, but it's not without its issues. And it's not applicable to all problems.

Are we getting anywhere?

Well, yes, we are getting better as methodology and technology evolves. The problem is that so far, the complexity of the digital world has increased at the same pace as our evolution. At one point we will probably catch up and start making real progress.

There are also some things we can do, that has proven to be successful, no matter the paradigm. I'll put out two:

1. Focus on throughput rather than short time to market.
You will get more and higher quality functionality out there in a given period of time, if your main goal is not to have the shortest time from idea to market. Lots and lots of companies fail here.

2. Employ smart people.
Managing a huge and constantly changing ecosystem is difficult. To do it successfully you need really smart people, and you need to give them the power.

OS development at Microsoft is a good example of the latter. They have performed the miracle of providing a seamless journey from MS-DOS 1.0 to Windows 11 (and corresponding  server OSes).

"Early-days Atlassian had a strong appeal - their core applications integrated reasonably well and offered a good unified experience which was great for training and cross-team collaboration. It was really great at the time for reporting and troubleshooting project management and development workflow issues as well, before you'd have to do some forensic hunt over a range of tools or write some software to do that.

There were issues and tons of areas for improvement but these could have been fixed. Instead they hit it off and switched to some vertical acquisition mode, acquiring other companies and half-bakedly integrating these into their ecosystem so they could tick as many feature-boxes as possible for their shareholders, so now there's multiple tools that do the same job, the core issues remain unfixed, we lost the ability to host our own instances, and now it feels just like any other SaaS enterprise ecosystem that ticks a bunch of boxes that don't play cohesively together.

If they would just get their engineers more onto the core issues instead of trying to cobble a patchwork of acquisitions into the semblance of a unified whole things could be a whole lot better.
