You make a good point. Agile is about management to give up control, and allow a self-organized development team to become more productive. However, thats not how it usually works. Management wants more control, daily standups become exhausting, developers feel that they are just doing daily standups for the sake of reporting progress to the managers. 

You may argue that its not really Agile anymore at this point, but managers say it is Agile, and developers blame Agile for their misfortune.

The Agile Manifesto was written to provide insights on how to run a software project as a self-organizing, flat operational structure where developers and business people work together without having managers standing in between. All of the principles detail the things that need to be considered in the absence of management, who in the traditional organizational structure are responsible to ensure that those facets stay on track.

It's a somewhat useful and somewhat insightful document if you plan to operate your software project under a flat structure, but when was the last time you saw an organization not have managers or show a strong desire to get rid of them? It's simply not applicable in 99.999% of cases.

63,"That's something that would be up to the hardware, not visible in the instruction set. ""Instruction Chaining"" is likely to be a common implementation technique in high end RISC-V Vector CPUs.

If you want to do it in a serious way for very large amounts of memory you'd use OS calls such as mmap() and friends, not memcpy(), for which the vast majority of calls are very small and in-cache.

The D1 chip this code was run on is a very low end chip, in Raspberry Pi Zero class (not Pi Zero 2). You can get it right now on a $17 board and later boards may well hit $10 or less -- Pine64 was promising one, but it hasn't been seen yet.

Note that even the version using integer registers hits 2x the RAM bandwidth when working in cache, while the vector version (with registers twice the size) hits 3.4x the RAM bandwidth.

So it's not as if you could make the actual copy go any faster anyway, only load the CPU a bit less while you're doing it.

This C906 core takes 3 clock cycles per 128 bits to do most vector operations. The same company's C910 out-of-order core (which you can buy in the ICE SoC on the ICE EVB, which you may have seen videos of running Android) has twice as wide vector registers, doing 2 vector instructions per cycle.

The matter is most of time we learned the bad habit of get things done. Period.

If we started from principle avoiding the OO monsters inheriting, interfacing etc. We could avoid brain draining on maintaining, correcting and extending code, even if written by ourselves.

I regret not learn about functional programming, pure functions, avoid side effects and mutability. Without understand and apply these knowledgement in every piece of code we are prone to correct one bug and create two and have nearly undebugable errors or erros of difficult reproduction on development test environment.

A very dummy example: a function that sums do it. Only it. If it receives a variable it not changes it. It returns other. So you will always know that the problem isnt in it. Then you write a function that reuses it, multiplication, means, standard deviation etc. All the pieces developed the same way the sum functions. You get confident that the things are in place.

Now make these functions as classes passed as arguments, callbacks, changing references, interfaces them, extends them... When something goes wrong the bug may be anywhere, be functions, classes, interfaces, modules or even files. It spreads for third part codebase and become a mess.

Really, for who is starting, I strongly recomment, learn a strictly functional language as Haskell, even you dont work with it. It will change the way you create code in the most useful ways.

Your post, I like. Probably because it mirrors much of my experience and what I complain about to anyone they will listen. 

I describe myself as a Social Introvert. I enjoy talking with people, but it tires me the fuck out. Half a day of taking to people? I'll not say anything for the rest of the day. I joke about the gamut of mental issues in a development team. The methods that seem to be designed by and for people that do not fit the archetypal developer - stereotypes are sometimes resent and not always bad! 

Agile solves some issues in theory. It creates some too. Like everything, bad points need to match aspects that do not matter to those involved. Unless the team goes balls in with agile, it's crippling. If the team doesn't understand the aim, then you end up diverging. I could go on for too long.

But, pair programming has uses. I've found it works better remotely than in person. One screen of shared code (whatever is used to do it), since voice comms and a second screen each to look at whatever else is required.

104,"Basically there are two types of errors:

1. You know that an error could happen at some place. Think of opening a file which might not exist. Such errors should be handled by return codes. It is important that the return codes cannot be ignored. In other words you cannot forget about them. In C an expression can be used at the place of a statement. In this case C silently ignores the result of the expression. [Seed7](http://seed7.sourceforge.net) does not have this approach. There is no silent ignoring of expressions.
2. Programming bugs. These are of course not foreseen by the programmer. E.g.: The programmer just forgot that an [integer overflow](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/manual/errors.htm#OVERFLOW_ERROR) can happen at a certain place. In Seed7 these unforeseen errors raise [exceptions](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/manual/errors.htm#Exceptions). As shown exceptions can be [handled](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/manual/errors.htm#Handlers). If an exception is not handled the program is terminated. So if you forget to handle an exception you will definitely find out quickly. 

Regarding type 1 errors: You can open a file with:

    aFile := open(""fileName"", ""r"");

As you can see it is necessary to assign the result of [open](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/external_file.htm#open(in_string,in_string)) to a variable (`aFile`). Afterwards `aFile` can be checked for [STD\_NULL](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/null_file.htm#STD_NULL) with:

    if aFile = STD_NULL then
    ... handle error ...
    else
    ... handle okay case ...
    end if;

Of course it is still possible to ""forget"" about checking `aFile`. In this case a [STD\_NULL](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/null_file.htm#STD_NULL) would be used. But even then it is probably easy to identify the error. Reading from [STD\_NULL](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/null_file.htm#STD_NULL) returns EOF and writing to [STD\_NULL](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/null_file.htm#STD_NULL) just ignores the data written.",1649889040,programming,ThomasMertes,programming,Comment,254

159,"&gt; it was pretty much the CTO talking with the middle technical managers talking with the teams one by one.

log4j was especially heinous in that almost everyone used it. But it sounds more and more like the defacto expert on depencencies managment is your CTO. Alternatively it could be spread over the multiple technical managers. There may be an attitude change because of this issue if the latter is the case.

&gt; Well, there's big and small deps. Of course some things are more closely followed than others, specially because we track costs and that means particularly infra is tracked. In those cases, the CTO talks directly with the teams.

That actually is completely fair. That said, generally companies who don't track this find it easier to get absurdly small external deps (things that are a 3 line code). After getting bit a few times, they will stop doing it.

But yeah I agree. Some deps you want to be very careful how you use them, some not as much. And some pieces of code require very careful vetting of external dependencies, others just a heads up for tracking purposes (I've been focusing on the latter). The scenario you don't want is to find out there's a liability on your code that was very well known and has been abused by others, and the reason it's there is because some guy joined the company, 3 months in put in this dependency without telling anyone, and then 9 months later left the company.

To help with that it should be impossible to bring up dependencies directly. One of the great things about Bazel is that a hermetic build means you have to explicitly say which external dependencies you're bringing, so it's easier to audit. But at some point you need to also have someone who can help you understand what is happening.

&gt; I didn't say every member of the team is an expert. I said you go to the team which is ""the expert"" in the project they maintain as a group

I agree with this, but I'm not asking for an expert user of a library. Simply someone who is an expert on where the library is used, on how a product depends on a library, not why or what that library does. Simply someone who can answer the question ""where are we using the library"". Being an expert on dependency is being an expert on how you depend on something, not on what you depend.

&gt; And in that case I bet most just manually grep and hope for the best TBH.

Maybe, but honestly the person who would know what is the best way to do this, even if all they do is a grep and hope-for-the best is the expert on dependencies. Maybe no the expert we need, but the expert we deserve, a dark contact point.. jokes aside, it would be the best the team has, but they would, defacto, be on that role.

And that's the core issue. The fact that someone has to fix this, means that the role exists, just by the need. If no one can fill it, the business can't function on a trivial managerial task. Ideally a company realizes this and formalizes the process a bit to make the job easier, alas that companies acknowledge that people do jobs that keep them alive is not that common sadly.",1649882798,programming,lookmeat,programming,Comment,570

I work a lot on TypeScript code, and we make heavy use of `io-ts`, which pretty much takes care of all our JSON decoding for us. We have two errors, parse errors for malformed JSON strings, and decode errors for when the JSON doesn‚Äôt have the correct structure.

No need for other abstractions, really. Just that. But my point is we didn‚Äôt have to create our own bespoke abstraction layer over any of that.

I don‚Äôt have a problem with abstractions. I just think most people wildly overestimate their ability to create a *good* abstraction.

And many people don‚Äôt even know what it means for an abstraction to be ‚Äúgood.‚Äù People generally like to hide implementation details, and lots of people would assume that as long as the implementation details don‚Äôt leak out to the user, then it‚Äôs a good abstraction, which is short-sighted.

The problem is, most developers heavily neglect other criteria. Like how well it composes with other libraries/protocols/patterns.

A common mistake I see people make is trying to have one abstraction do way too many things. Usually it‚Äôs better to have a bunch of smaller tools that you can compose together to fit your specific needs, rather than one or two monolithic tools that try to do everything ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù Ideally you have a bunch of mostly ‚Äúpure‚Äù functions that work with a common set of data types.

Anyway, you get what I‚Äôm saying. Good abstractions are hard to produce.

190,"&gt; all this dumb, imperative logic steps are still there

By dumb imperative logic I've meant ""take from the database, put into the socket"" part, it's explicit. Interpretation details hidden, like tracing, instrumentation, async io.

&gt; So, i get that the programmer has, in theory, less work to do to achieve the goal.

Ok, so u/crimson_chin nailed in their comment, but I'll articulate that nonetheless.

The point is in disentangling what matters to you know from what doesn't. When you are writing logic as in the snippet above, you'd like to focus on business logic and business errors when you read and write it, you don't want to think about tracing or async io, you want to stay in one, well defined layer of abstraction.

That's why networking is built with layers,you don't have to think of RF jitter when you do the routing, you don't have to think of routing when you write network applications. Other domains are the same, you hide everything which is lower level under your DSL interpreter, and focus on what matters at current layer in which your actual problem lies.

&gt; What about new programmers, coming into the field and learning your meta language without learning the basics and metal works, all the things that are done for them?

Do network layers make people ignorant of radio signals and circuits? I don't think so, I think that if anything clearly separated layers of abstraction help with learning stuff on various levels better, than entangled mess. 

And sometimes it goes full Ouroboros and people define electrical circuits [1] [2] and machine codes [3] as meta languages.

Ruby belongs to category #2, and if you have a category #1 task you can gain a lot from doing it in Java instead (or any other category #1 language. Don't bikeshed this particular example) - maybe enough to cover the hassle of introducing another language. But if you have a category #2 task that for whatever reason even a Ruby enthusiastic would admit Python is more suitable for - the difference is not going to be big enough to justify using a language you are less familiar with, having to hire developers who know it, finding new libraries, not being able to use existing in-house code etc. Inter-category languages are not **that** different from each other in terms of their use cases.",1649877705,programming,somebodddy,programming,Comment,174

237,"I like this list.  I have two more items for it:

- Language support for concurrency at the thread and a sub-thread (in other words: like co-routines or ""fibers"" that split thread processing even further) and incorporate the locking and waiting into the language. 

[This](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4024.pdf) is a better discussion of the difference between fibers and coroutines.  I'm not snobby enough to demand a programming language has both of course, and I don't know of any language that builds both directly into the language, but I do want it to contain at least one of those.  Of course, that means that C++ itself is off the table for me personally even though the referenced paper which discusses these concepts in context of C++ and Boost.

Why?  Well, I have my last requirement for programming languages:

- I have to be smart enough to write reliable code for that language.  And quite honestly, this takes C++ and Rust off the table for me; C++ because I don't like how easy it is to run afoul of competing expectations with libraries and other unexpected side effects and is now too big of a language for anyone to really understand anymore, and Rust because the cognitive overhead of the language is simply too great. 

Golang I can handle.  C# I can handle.  I still prefer not to touch Java when it comes to concurrency though, simply because the language doesn't have enough support, but it's still far and away better than something like Python on CPython; although even that is ""not so bad"" compared to the numerous Electron style apps out there now that use large multiple processes just to start a single application.


Let's face it: We don't idolize programming languages.  We do however continually seek out languages and tools that mesh the best with how we think about problems and how to solve them.  I really love that we have more options than ever today, and that we're finally getting away from demanding heavy OOP in everything we do.  That's just a distraction when one considers the enabling features of programming languages in general.  It certainly won't solve concurrency issues for example, and it never really relieved me of any complexity; just the opposite actually.

For example, Python is reasonably good for most stuff, pretty damn great as glue for native extensions, but pretty bad by itself at being fast (you would need those native extensions which by definition are not written in Python). But in the end that makes it pretty damn great for data science where such extensions are widely available and pretty good for most backend programming where IO is the bottleneck.

288,"&gt;An array processor cannot perform the multiply until the load is done. The vector processor in contrast after 3 chimes start performing 3 different operations in parallel, with each operation processing 4 elements.

Uh, what? Obviously you can't perform a multiply until you have actually loaded the data. Also, modern CPUs are super-scalar with out-of-order-execution, so it's not like it's executing instructions one at a time, waiting for it to finish before executing the next one. I'm genuinely confused what the author is trying to convey here.

&gt;A processor which can do 4 integers in parallel, cannot have more than 128-bit vector registers. A vector processing CPU in contrast could have 1024-bit vector registers without any problems.

There is nothing preventing a microarchitecture from splitting fixed-width SIMD instructions into multiple ¬µops, Many common real-world examples of this exists, e.g. x86 CPUs supporting 256-bit AVX instructions while only having 128-bit SIMD units.

Overall this is yet another article ""comparing"" fixed-width SIMD with variable-width vector processing by only mentioning the advantages of the latter without a single quip about disadvantages.

As with most things in engineering there are pros and cons of different approaches and it's all about tradeoffs.

Anything that involves reordering data, matrix transposes for example, tends to be much easier with fixed-width SIMD, and reordering data happens to be very common in most applications.

If you're just going to churn through millions of FMAs with all the data neatly arranged, then yes, variable-width vector processing is great. But there's a reason why fixed-width SIMD has been the approach of choice for decades when it comes to general-purpose CPUs.",1649871757,programming,th3typh00n,programming,Comment,269

295,"&gt;Because it wasn't your example or a real one, but as an imaginary one that's easy to think of. A larger company would have more bureaucracy and a process to achieve the same goal, I chose tiny because it's a clearer example.

Valid.

&gt;So if there happens to be a log4j type issue in a library, Joe do you know which teams to bring you the table, who to talk to, what to do?

Really?  That was a big deal precisely because, other than some automated audits, it was pretty much the CTO talking with the middle technical managers talking with the teams one by one.

&gt;You aren't answering the question: who do I go to without having to do an audit (ie having a meeting with every team) myself? That can be an expensive process. Are you telling me any team could say ""we're hosting on Windows"" without telling anyone?

Well, there's big and small deps. Of course some things are more closely followed than others, specially because we track costs and that means particularly infra is tracked. In those cases, the CTO talks directly with the teams.

&gt;Well that's nice. But that's not the question. The question is: what teams are using &lt;insert name&gt; dependency across the company? Who do I ask?  
&gt;  
&gt;Who's the expert on how we depend on that across the company?

There's a big Slack channel to ask for that, no single expert. How appropriate that is will obviously depend on the size of the company. Your experience in FAANG will never match the experience of people in middle and small companies in that regard.

&gt;Without that I don't care how teams use it, what for, or how we could mitigate an issue. I can talk to the individual teams, but I need to first know who I actually need to talk to. If I just ""have to ask the teams"" it misses the point.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's cute, impossibly idealistic, but cute. There's a go-to to answer certain things, that makes them the defacto expert. I doubt your team wastes time ensuring every member has a perfect copy of the others knowledge and skills. The whole point of a team is that members specialize.

I didn't say every member of the team is an expert. I said you go to *the team* which is *""the expert""* in the project they maintain as a group. For big deps, as mentioned, some individuals in the team will be more knowledgeable than others. For smaller stuff it's pretty much everything goes. And it's like that in all shops I've been and in all shops my acquaintances have been.

&gt;Now that every team member is good enough to help and take on any part of the project? That's good engineering. But some are going to be the better choice for some problems, others for others.

We agree here.

&gt;And remember I don't need to audit code, just if a library uses something or not. At some places you can just run a query to know that, but most places are not going to build such tech.

And in that case I bet most just manually grep and hope for the best TBH.

&gt;Again you can't hire a dependency expert, you need someone to take the time and understand how your company uses a library. Not why they use it, not how that library works, just a list of the places it's used. That is someone who understands how you use a library, what you're dependency on that library is, not how that library works.  
&gt;  
&gt;And most places have it, it's more ad hoc, and won't use the same terms. In some places it's simply one of the responsibilities of the most senior developer, or the tech lead, or the CTO. Sometimes it isn't.

We agree here, finally.

&gt;Certainly there's places that don't track it in any way. They generally struggle because they waste a lot of resources on managing multiple dependencies.

There's a big difference between struggling and going bankrupt. A lot of places have their employees overworked because of issues that are hard or completely impractical to keep up with unless you work at a giant. That doesn't mean the company is not profitable.

We agree that having a go-to person for (at least) big deps makes everyone's life easier. I disagree that there's one in all successful (read, profitable) company and certainly that where there is that it's always a formal role rather than something much more organic (e.g., I don't have a ""title"" of go-to person for Linux kernel tech, but people who talk with me know I try to keep up so they tend to ask me first).

&gt;Even to this there are exceptions of course, but at this point it is a much smaller minority.

Up to this point, I think we're both talking about anecdotal perceptions, and specially we obviously come from different backgrounds that bias those perceptions. I personally don't think FAANG is at all a representative sample of the industry's state of affairs.

I don't have numbers and it may be specific to my country, but mine is that it's by far not the minority. If you have any numbers to share this can get more interesting.",1649871297,programming,miembro_maniaco,programming,Comment,878

Some years ago I prototyped an ""invasive"" Android app that modeled a PKG. It modeled user definable typed nodes and edges. There were 3 out-of-the-box components it modeled:

* people
* times
* places

When I try to recall things, it's often the case that I need to recall one of those 3 dimensions but can only remember the other 1 or 2. So a PKG here seems apt.

The app running in background built a timeline of all your stops (Google does too). Each stop was a node to which you could annotate more nodes. In particular, you could annotate *person* nodes, implemented thru Contacts app. Which is why I called it *invasive*. In fact, a phone's entire (Android) app ecosystem could be modeled as a PKG. (So you could annotate pictures to a ""stop"", for eg)

Honestly, I'm not sure where any of this is going yet. Since we already have pipelines, the key is to keep the pipelines fed with data. That's what a vector unit would be for. But I can't really see how variable stride vectors fit in with the type of load/store unit used on high performance processors. SIMD fits right in, vector seems like it doesn't.

Maybe it'll catch on in simple processors where load/store units just aren't as complex? This seems like maybe it would help get the most out of a low complexity load/store unit.

340,"It reads like this XKCD comic, but more judgey: [https://xkcd.com/198/](https://xkcd.com/198/)

What goal are you trying to accomplish? Usually, when you are trying to persuade someone of something, you need a ""value,"" an end goal that you hope everyone agrees is good, and then a reason why what you're advocating for maximizes that value. The value here is completely unclear, but it seems like you're advocating for ""spending less time advocating for things that don't matter."" Given that you're spending time advocating against it, that comes off as ironic and hypocritical.

I suspect that you're experiencing some form of communication burn-out, and are projecting it on everyone else. Writing is thinking, so if the thoughts aren't fundamentally interesting, the writing won't be good. But if you are trying to talk about your personal experience being overwhelmed with trite and repetitive comments, or caring about something like what PL is better, you can write a thoughtful essay about that, like the XKCD comment, but without the projection.

What is your thesis?  
* I'm tired of yelling about programming languages; it doesn't feel that important.
    * Then write about your tiredness.
* Which programming language you use isn't important.
    * OK, then what is, and why? Evidence, evidence, evidence.
* Old programming languages are better than new ones, actually, because of experience.
    * If this is your thesis, all of your evidence must point to this.
* Yelling on the Internet is a waste of time.
    * Ironic, so you should recognize that irony, given what you're literally doing.
    * You need to support this thesis, not the other ones I've listed.

Your article has an identity crisis, I think because you're expressing burn-out instead of actually making a point. If you do want to make a point, then I think you can make whatever point it is better. If your thesis is an emotion you feel, you can do that too, but it's rude to be so judgey about it.",1649868510,programming,thecodedmessage,programming,Comment,328

353,"&gt; Why do you assume it was tiny companies?

Because it wasn't your example or a real one, but as an imaginary one that's easy to think of. A larger company would have more bureaucracy and a process to achieve the same goal, I chose tiny because it's a clearer example.

&gt; At least in my company..

So if there happens to be a log4j type issue in a library, Joe do you know which teams to bring you the table, who to talk to, what to do?

You aren't answering the question: who do I go to without having to do an audit (ie having a meeting with every team) myself? That can be an expensive process. Are you telling me any team could say ""we're hosting on Windows"" without telling anyone?

&gt; Each team is an expert in their project here

Well that's nice. But that's not the question. The question is: what teams are using &lt;insert name&gt; dependency across the company? Who do I ask? Who's the expert on how we depend on that across the company? Without that I don't care how teams use it, what for, or how we could mitigate an issue. I can talk to the individual teams, but I need to first know who I actually need to talk to. If I just ""have to ask the teams"" it misses the point.

 &gt; Each team is an expert in their project here. Regarding ""library experts"", we pretty much audit all the same because there's no single expert.

That's cute, impossibly idealistic, but cute. There's a go-to to answer certain things, that makes them the defacto expert. I doubt your team wastes time ensuring every member has a perfect copy of the others knowledge and skills. The whole point of a team is that members specialize.

Now that every team member is good enough to help and take on any part of the project? That's good engineering. But some are going to be the better choice for some problems, others for others.

And remember I don't need to audit code, just if a library uses something or not. At some places you can just run a query to know that, but most places are not going to build such tech.

&gt; Nobody is talking about needs, but about viability. Proper experts is something most places don't have.

Again you can't hire a dependency expert, you need someone to take the time and understand how your company uses a library. Not why they use it, not how that library works, just a list of the places it's used. That is someone who understands how you use a library, what you're dependency on that library is, not how that library works.

And most places have it, it's more ad hoc, and won't use the same terms. In some places it's simply one of the responsibilities of the most senior developer, or the tech lead, or the CTO. Sometimes it isn't.

Certainly there's places that don't track it in any way. They generally struggle because they waste a lot of resources on managing multiple dependencies.

&gt; You're using ""expert"" to describe what ""responsible"" means, I think.

No. The expert just has to know, but isn't the person who should ""fix"" it. An expert on a dependency can call on all the people responsible for our dependency on a library (because they understand which teams depend on it, and can ask them to bring someone responsible to manage).

Honestly I'd rather have someone be the owner of the dependency. They have some authority to decide what is happening. They don't just track but analyze. They decide what is and isn't a valid use of the library inside our company. That would also make them responsible. But that is something most companies can't afford.

364,"&gt; Why we're using so many libraries doesn't matter, only the fact that we are. 

It does matter though, if one wants to do anything more than just complain about it. 

What the packages are being used for matters. The same guy that spams npm with packages like is-number, is-odd, etc. also is the author of the library for the best CLI user prompts, the entire ecosystem of markdown parsers and plugins, YAML parsers, etc.

Nobody is purposely installing `is-number` in their application. They can write that function themselves if needed. It's included as a transitive dependency of something that is not possible to write yourself, such as hot reloading or Markdown parsing. That's why it matters, and that's why it's worth looking into the dependency tree (as I have done throughout this conversation) to actually understand where these are coming from. And that's why it's possible to **accept** the current state of things, knowing that it is not ideal, but accepting it nonetheless. 

Want to create a standard library to reduce the number of dependencies and stop transitively using stupid dependencies like `is-odd`? Go for it! Write a replacement for a hot loader (`chokidar`) so that doesn't depend on `is-glob`. Create an ecosystem of linting tools to replace `eslint` so that it doesn't depend on `is-number`. Or create patches to these upstream dependencies.

366,"Expert just means ""authority"". What I'm saying is that you're an expert on a very specific thing, but not in everything. An expert driver is not a great mechanic. An expert manager is not an expert user.

And that's the core thing. An expert on a dependency is an expert on how we depend on it and how we don't. They don't need to be an expert user (who knows how to best use a library in code), they don't need to be an expert on the subject (who best knows the theory and knowledge in certain area). Now ideally the dependency expert is a decent user and knows something on the subject of the library, if they happen to be expert on those areas that's great; but the reality is that most aren't, and that's ok. You don't need to be an ambiguously defined expert, just an expert on *how a dependency is being used*.

&gt; So‚Ä¶ basically anyone who has imported and used the library regularly in the codebase? ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù is relatively meaningless in that context. Under that definition, most people would be considered experts on most of our dependencies at my company, which defeats the purpose of drawing a distinction between experts and non-experts.

The expert is the authority, the person who best understands where is *everywhere* that it's imported. If there's no one person who can answer for everywhere it's used (it can quickly get you the answer with certainty), then there's no person that knows how much you depend on the dependency.

Understand, when you use a dependency you don't need to audit every line. You don't need to understand the intricacies of how the library works. You don't need to be able to debug it. The whole point of using an external dependency is that it you trust someone else can do that for you. If you have enough resources to do it yourself, you could just as well create your in-house version (and this is why so many large companies end up suffering ""but invented here"" syndrome) and that's strictly better.

But the thing is, you need to understand what version, it versions, of a dependency are used. Say that I get news that lib foobar has a serious weakness that has been exploited to steal private information. I know we use foobar. I can start an investigation on what the impact could be (scour leak dumps to see if they contain any info of ours) and how to best manage it. That cost me a lot of man-hours and is a huge financial loss. But it turns out that the bug happened in foobar 2.4-2.6, which are used a lot, but at the company we only use foobar 1.6 because 2.x is backwards incompatible. Even if we had reason, we don't use foobar on secure services, which are run as separate processes on separate containers to increase privacy, so even then foobar wouldn't have leaked critical user information that wasn't already public.

Note the core thing I haven't answered in this story: I never say what foobar does. Turns out that dependency management is far more about where, when and what, not how or why a dependency is used. Ideally, given the sensitivity of the subject, I, as the company owner, would like to know quickly if I should do the expensive investigation or not (because if a user finds out and publishes that we had a leak before we do that can be a serious problem). So I need to find the person to best ask where, when and what uses of foobar we do across the code, the person who best knows and best can answer the question, the authority for that, the expert if you will.

No matter if multiple people can answer: one is the bigger authority, and, by the definition of the word, that makes them the most expert.

&gt; MANY companies do not have a CTO or TL position.

Never said ""all"", I have other alternatives. It could be senior if whatever. Instead of focusing on nitpicking look at the bigger message: most companies have their dependency experts by defacto, because they're needed.

&gt; That‚Äôs what it means to be a technical resource. If some of my coworkers know our build system inside and out, and then they leave the company, we have lost technical knowledge. Those people are technical resources to the company.

Let's just repeat this: choosing what tool to use is not just a technical decision.

If I use a quirky but well known build system, like Bazel, and we have one engineer that knows it's ins and outs, an expert on Bazel, and we lose them; we can recover the most knowledge by hiring a new person based on their Bazel expertise.

If we use multiple build systems (don't ask why, it's just what it is), and we lose our in-house Bazel expert, and it's bad enough that we can't keep using it (let's assume it's a really technically weak shop, where most devs don't even understand how to use build systems without guidance). Then hiring someone just for help with a small project that is still experimental would be a waste. It'd be better to make them switch to one of the build systems we have better in-house expertise for. The thing is: how do I know. I could ask, basically audit the company, get a gauge of the problem and then decide which of the two scenarios it is. That's an expensive way. I could have someone that keeps track of our uses of Bazel, and if it happened to be the guy that just left (wouldn't be surprising), I ask them before they go and make my decision based on the data they have. But it might be another engineer who tracks the many ways we build our projects and has an understanding of what build systems, compilers, etc are used across the company, even if they are not privy to the details of how or why, I don't need that. Finally I could guess, but then gambling is not the best way to make a business decision.

&gt; That‚Äôs definitely how many shops handle it, but that doesn‚Äôt make them an expert, unless we accept your loose definition.

Again the definition is ""someone who is knowledgeable and an authority in a subject"". When you have a dependency that word doesn't mean ""what we depend on"" (though people loosely use it like that in tech) but how we depend on it. An expert on heroin addiction and an expert on heroin are different things, and one is not a subset if the other. An expert on OpenSSH could explain how heartbleed works, an expert on our OpenSSH dependency can explain how heartbleed affects us. The definition does not have space to assume that one implies the other. Assuming that one implies the other is the looser (and I mean loose here, but trying to qualify beyond that) take.",1649865458,programming,lookmeat,programming,Comment,1169

386,"&gt;But who did the CEO of these tiny companies

Why do you assume it was tiny companies?

&gt; go to an ask ""how fucked are we""?

At least in my company, it was each team reviewing their own, plus I think the SRE team. There was no single ""library expert"". It's not FAANG but I wouldn't call it tiny.

&gt;That person is the library expert. In a larger company it's who the CTO goes to, and if we get larger it's at a lower level before we start getting to someone who can actually answer it (or knows how to research and get the answer). That's the library expert. They may not know how to fix the issue, they may not know what is the best way to manage it, but they can define the impact.

Each team is an expert in their project here. Regarding ""library experts"", we pretty much audit all the same because there's no single expert. It's just another issue because we care about our product and we debug our product and we draw conclusions from what we do in our product. The library is an implementation detail that may or may not break. I wouldn't call my project a web one tho, it's too far down the stack for that and it certainly is not done in JS.

&gt;If the CEO can't ask anyone this question, if they have no idea to start. Well you can see why this is going to be worse. It's easy to think you don't need this person, that's a terrible idea.

Nobody is talking about needs, but about viability. Proper experts is something most places don't have. Maybe for the bigger parts yes, if you do Rails you probably have someone who knows more about the framework than everyone else, but you most likely don't have an expert on that tiny module that does some trivial task.",1649864290,programming,miembro_maniaco,programming,Comment,318

394,"&gt;I work at a FAANG company, any external library needs multiple experts (or owners is what we call them). They have no idea about the source-code. They can debug issues, but generally they don't, instead people using the library do the debugging. But the expert decides what is needed to be allowed to use the library, and has a way to track everyone using it. If you want to push a fix and then pull the new update, the expert needs to give it approval. It's mostly ceremonial, but when shit hits the fan, the expert is the person who best understands how the library is used in the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;If someone joins the company, they think ""we should use library A"", and starts using it for their project, they become the de-facto expert on the subject.  
&gt;  
&gt;So all you need to ensure an expert, is arbitrarily choose a person to be the gate-keeper for that dependency. Just by having that role they will become the person most knowledgeable of how that library is being used. By the sake of being an authority on how to use the library they become the expert.  
&gt;  
&gt;People assume that an expert is someone who can answer all the questions. An expert is someone you can ask all the questions, they may not answer any, but they know how to forward them.  
&gt;  
&gt;dependencies rarely get as much review as in-house code itself and rarely there's an ""expert"" in them in place.  
&gt;  
&gt;You don't quite review the dependency. You trust the dependency to have a team that is sufficiently good at it (what that means is a separate issue). What you review is that you didn't have the library replaced by malicious code as a political statement. It's really more a sanity check.

All that seems to me like you're labeling ""expert"" on people who aren't, and that leads to problems. Having someone to blame doesn't make them any more of an expert.

&gt;What you do investigate and review is when in-house code starts using an external dependency. Unless it's being seriously misused (which again depends on your shop, and it isn't critical) it's more about just giving the ACK that the library is being used somewhere else.  
&gt;  
&gt;You're misunderstanding the issue here. An expert is an authority, generally by knowledge on the area. An expert on a dependency is an authority and understands a library only as a dependency, they know how much it's used, where and how. They understand if updating a version is a delicate procedure or something to take casually. They are the person who you contact first when a critical security bug is revealed on a dependency, and they will know who are the people you need to bring into a room.

You're using ""expert"" to describe what ""responsible"" means, I think.

&gt;You can also have expert AI-developers, or expert statisticians, etc. etc. They may recommend using a library, and you may choose to follow the advice and let them import them. Then they could also be your library dependency expert, as well as an expert user.

Yes, and again, this doesn't describe the common case in the slightest. I'm not denying some places have it. But you make a blanket statement of how people work that isn't remotely close to the reality of most shops. Again, I'm glad you work at a FAANG with those resources, but the one who stated ""everyone is doing is wrong"" is the one describing ""the right way"" a way that isn't reachable to most.

&gt;But it's perfectly fine if your expert on a library is not the most expert user. Maintaining a library and it's versions is something very different from actually using it. Lets understand what are the skills we are talking about here.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's on-calls, who will do whatever is needed to keep the system. Then there's the expert that will tell you what the impact is. You may or may not have an expert that can help you fix the problem in-house.  
&gt;  
&gt;Think of a library expert like a driver. They can tell you when the car needs to go to a mechanic, even if they can't fix it themselves. They may also tell you who is going to need to get a cab to get home now that there isn't a car. Just like driving a car doesn't need to deeply understand how the car works, just understand what happens when it doesn't, being an expert dependency maintainer doesn't require understanding how an external dependency work, just what happens when it doesn't.

I can agree with this definition as a middle point, and still it doesn't describe most shops.

&gt;What is thorough? Just having a couple people check on the guarantees and limitations of the library and say ""looks good enough""? I think most can do that.

Yes. And ""looks good enough"" is so vague in most cases it gives close to no value in terms of security or measuring expertise.

&gt;Having a deep analysis understanding what is going on inside? It kind of misses the point of a third-party library. The places that could get away with doing this deep analysis, almost always prefer to make their own in-house solution (that may be open-source), it's about as hard but you get the flexibility to modify the library as you want.

We agree. But then they're not experts IMO.

&gt;I agree that it's impractical. I disagree that it's what I'm proposing.

Well, only you knew what you were proposing and your choice of words conveyed a different thing. Note, what you propose *is sane*. I'm not denying that. But it doesn't sound the same as in your original post.

&gt;And this is the misunderstanding. This is fine for a hacky project, where you are exploring things, understanding problems, and mostly just trying to get something out.

Note what I mention is about nested dependencies. There's some amount of complexity that adds up because your dep uses a dep that uses a dep. You need to trust each step and have an ""expert"" in each step. That may scale when you have hundreds of devs, but when you have under, let's say, 30, it stops working.

&gt;But you don't build a house the way you build a bikeshed :). When you get thousands of dollars on the line, if not millions, you ensure first that you won't lose that money, then go to get more. A small review process, when you bring a new dependency, the reviewer will ask you why you think it's ok, you make your argument. If the dependency is already used elsewhere, you bring the guy who

I think one big difference is dogfooding.

They didn't tell third parties to use Cocoa until they had multiple Cocoa apps ready. Nor Carbon until they had ported Finder to Carbon as a PoC. And they mostly continue with that to this day.

484,"Part of that is the fault of Javascript as a language, with its anemic ""standard library"" (which basically means a handful of global functions and global objects that have methods and prototypes). It's a lot better now (though it's still lacking a lot of basic stuff), but for a long time it was not unreasonable to want to pull in some utility functions to make your life a bit easier.

IMO, the better route was to have a couple of mono-packages like Lodash that combine a lot of functionality into a single package, plus a tree-shaking build tool so that you didn't actually bundle way more code than you need. That at least lowered the number of entities you needed to trust and vet, and in general kept the cognitive load you needed to understand your dependencies down.

But in general I still ""get"" why people would reach for things like leftpad when tools like NPM made it soooo easy to add packages willy-nilly. It's not surprising that people thought ""hmm, I could a) spend 5 minutes writing this utility function, potentially missing a few bugs or edge cases that will give me a headache later, b) spend an hour writing and testing this silly little utility function to make sure it's 100% ship shape, and then maybe some additional time later to maintain it, or c) spend 10 minutes now finding, installing, and learning to use a package that does it for me, and trust that they've covered the edge cases and will maintain it"".

486,"I just checked a fresh create-react-app, and it pulls 7 direct dependencies. 4 of those are for the testing library and for hot reload / dev environment, so it's odd to me why that would be a prod dependency and not a dev dependency, so that feels like either a bug or some strange reason why that's the case.

Of the 3 remaining dependencies (react, react-dom, web-vitals), there are 3 additional transitive dependencies (loose-envify, js-tokens, scheduler) for a total of 6 dependencies. Those 3 additional deps could be ported together as a ""React standard library"" but I'm not sure about those specific 3 packages as they're also used outside of React.

Note that I'm **not** saying that a create-react-app is not bloated. The react-scripts dev dependency has a crazy amount of dependencies to do hot reloading, dev time bundling of SASS/SCSS, minifying JS, transpiling to older browser versions, providing debug symbols for developers, an HTTP proxy server, etc. Arguably, react-scripts **is** the standard _development_ library for React.

However, when I think of _standard library_, I'm thinking of runtime features and I'm not sure that the development dependencies qualify. I'm not saying that your idea doesn't have merit, there could be value in some sort of library for each of the popular frameworks but at the moment I'm not seeing where the space for that is or the details of what would be in it.",1649856610,programming,Tubthumper8,programming,Comment,234

538,"Generally I agree, compared to development from the 80's and 90's you have a large swathe of usable languages that produce quality software.

Having a ""good"" language helps to produce quality software but what ""good"" means varies to the team doing the development, the goals, and it's backing IMHO.

You have a few groups of ""programmers"" too, ones that will spend most of their time doing CRUD development, ones that will work on low-level systems, ones that will work on high-level  UI's, ones that will work on mathematics, and ones that focus around data-science (and likely other more niche groups).

Today we have a dozen or so generic languages that do everything ""well enough""; building quality code is possible with constraints, performance is tolerable, and the learning curve is low enough to have a continuous churn of available programmers for a healthy business.

Unlike a few decades ago, even the specialist languages have just enough capability to support most everyone (yet again, with constraints though) and communities have bounded together to make said languages do REALLY well in those specific areas.

I wouldn't recommend Rust to everyone, I also wouldn't recommend something like Java / C# to a team doing embedded development (it's possible, but it's not easy).

Minecraft uses immutable vector instances everywhere and forget about them instanty - however they use it in such manner that escape analysis cannot work. (aka, they juggle references all around) GC is overworked, having to clean up even around 1gb of these per second.

666,"&gt; I think HTML is a terrible language for client application design.

Oh, I agree.

I bring it up because it, too, is an example where other DSLs have been embedded. Text editors these days can handle such hybrid syntax highlighting OK, so I'm not sure this is a big problem.

What I will say is that XAML starts to feel _cluttered_ very quickly once you add things like styles. I really wish Xamarin Forms's optional approach of moving styles to CSS had been invested into more. It feels like something an intern built once and then nobody picked it up. (I even made a few minor PRs to improve it slightly. But it needs more love.)

The general ""let's have curly braces inside XML"" stuff in XAML is‚Ä¶ fine. It's not very attractive, nor intuitive (syntax like `&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=""{Binding DataContext.IDToolTipInfo, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=UserControl}}"" /&gt;` is absurd), but if anything, I wish they would _add_ to that and allow lambdas. Blazor does this better. Just let me do `&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=""@(ctx =&gt; ctx.GetAncestorOfType&lt;UserControl&gt;()"" /&gt;` or something.

&gt; But CSS and JavaScript had a completely different development history. They were not developed by the same people or at the same time.

No, but even if CSS had been developed in conjunction, I don't think embedding portions of it as a DSL inside HTML is a poor choice. It works fine both for simple cases (inline `style` attribute) and complex cases (separate file).

&gt;I would claim that the reason why XML was used was because it was still in vogue in 2006.

Yes, that definitely played a big role. Lots of stuff they did in XML in the early 2000s has since been redesigned in JSON or YAML instead. (For example, early .NET was big on XML-based `.config` files; now it's big on JSON-based configs.)

But I think XML is a perfectly valid choice for a hierarchy of controls in a user interface for the same reason it's a good choice for a hierarchy of elements on a document (HTML): because you _have_ a visual hierarchy. That's why we get things like Dev Tools for HTML and the Live Visual Tree for XAML. Works great.

&gt; They should have just made a language that was strongly typed all the way because bindings are not strongly typed

They have a long way to go, but the XAML editor _is_ now aware of the actual properties in the bound type. If it cannot infer that type, it warns you and suggests you explicitly annotate it. It's not statically typed (you can lie about the type and set a different one at runtime), but I wouldn't classify it as weakly typed.",1649843360,programming,chucker23n,programming,Comment,444

However, I have some feedback on how to improve the article:

The figures about the chaining of functional units look nice, but they are confusing for a few reasons. In the first of those figures (the one just before ""First Clock Cycle""), the legend for ""Data Flow"" shows a yellow color, but there is no yellow color in the figure. There is a green color at the ""Address Flow"" arrow, but no legend. It's probably an earlier version of that figure, and it becomes clear comparing it to the subsequent figures, but I was confused about it for a moment.

However, I'm still confused about the unit after the data flow arrow. It's not labeled, and I don't understand why it has an arrow pointing upwards as well. Does it write to all those v_i?

Overall, the operation performed in the figure is not something I recognize and it would have been good to explain what it does first.
If it's a non standard operation, maybe it would be better to use something more common, like a dot product or whatnot.

Lastly, the part about ""Advantage of Vector Processing over GPUs"" would be a lot more convincing if there were examples where they are superior. The advantages are briefly outlined, but it would be a much stronger argument if there were examples to point to.

Sadly as the spec was only rarified in November and it takes 18 to 24 months to build a chip there is not yet any system available that runs RVV 1.0 code. Probably several companies had chips virtually ready to go, barring any last minute changes in the spec (which there weren't), so maybe we'll see something around the end of the year or early next year for boards.

Which is pretty quick. ARM published the finished SVE specification in August 2016 (and SVE2 in April 2019). I don't know of any reasonably cheap SBC with SVE available yet. Is it in the new top of the line phones with ARMv9? I don't know.

What mere mortals can buy right now is Alibaba T-Head's C906 single-issue core in the 1 GHz Allwinner ""D1"" chip, in a variety of boards starting from the $17 LicheeRV and a $28 Pi CM3-compatible card sold in the DevTerm Kit R-01 and also stand-alone if you have an ARM-based DevTerm already.

On mobile, they have a reputation problem, and they deserve it. Nobody goes ‚Äúyou know what we should do? Switch **to** Xamarin Forms!‚Äù Too many long-standing gnarly issues have remained. MAUI will be better at some point, but not by much, and the inevitably messy migration means some teams might actually choose it as the moment to transition *away*.

Their dogfooding is still bad, suggesting higher-ups don‚Äôt get it or don‚Äôt care.

On macOS, they‚Äôre moving to Catalyst, away from AppKit. This is a bit puzzling because, in roughly the same time period, they‚Äôve moved their VSMac IDE *to* AppKit. It‚Äôs also worse than I had thought. As of the previous preview, want a checkbox? Don‚Äôt use CheckBox, use Toggle. Catalyst will show that as a checkbox. It won‚Äôt show CheckBox as a checkbox, because that one is custom-drawn by MAUI. Radio buttons? Catalyst apparently isn‚Äôt aware those are a thing. Those are always custom-drawn, and as of the previous preview, [they look incredibly bad.](https://twitter.com/chucker/status/1510401307814862852) (left: Xamarin Forms, whose text looks worse, but at least it has radio buttons!) If you use Catalyst without MAUI, one workaround is to use SwiftUI. So far, I haven‚Äôt quite succeeded at embedding that. There‚Äôs also always hoping Apple improves the controls situation, but at that point, you‚Äôre cutting off even more users with an older OS.

At this point, it‚Äôs impossible to recommend MAUI if you also want to target Macs, unless you really don‚Äôt care about good UI at all (at which point, just use Blazor and make it a hybrid web app, oh, and also, that one will support radio buttons!). If you‚Äôre only interested in mobile, MAUI might be a decent choice‚Ä¶ next year, when the kinks are worked out.

I still like writing UI in XAML especially now that Hot Reload has gradually been getting better. I wish they‚Äôd invest more in CSS-based styling. I wish they‚Äôd make refactoring in XAML a *lot* better.

764,"Async in Rust is far more sensible - it's much harder to lose track of errors because exceptions aren't the preferred way to report them. Panics are basically only for ""this should never happen and I don't know what to do now"" kind of errors. Otherwise, functions explicitly return their errors, and the compiler will prompt you to do something with them. So it's always very obvious that errors should go somewhere. There's no callback hell since it's been futures (like promises) from the beginning, and the async/await syntax is now so established that it's universal.

It doesn't really have any of the issues that make async in JS suck, though it does have some of its own - for example, sometimes the type system doesn't like certain things in async, or the internal types just get very long and slow things down, there's the inability for traits to have async functions, though boxed futures are ok, and there's a library that will allow you to write async functions in traits and just convert them. Probably the biggest issue it has right now is that the compiler errors for async code are not nearly as clear as they are for most other Rust code, and you run into messages that are sometimes cryptic, and issues like pinning.

Still, it's also basically optional. There are some libraries that provide their sync interface on top of the async internal code and just give you a window into it, and others where there are just alternatives available if you want to use a sync I/O model or an async I/O model. Worst case, you can just call into a reactor and wait on its handle or on a channel.",1649835184,programming,wishthane,programming,Comment,286

They're still used primarily because of millions of LoC of legacy code and inertia.

Yeah, sure, they ""work,"" but newer languages also have the benefit of hindsight. If you really know C, then you know damn well that language could be improved upon. Same with C++. Rust is basically ""what if modern C++, but we didn't have to give half a shit about compatibility with C or older C++ code?"" plus a healthy dose of Haskell in the type system.

For the last option you should probably check which languages and tools are most in demand where you live.

JS can be used for web development, backend systems, desktop applications and with React Native also for mobile apps. It can be used to create games but the games will probably be simpler than C++ or C# allows. There is also some IoT support.

Java can be used for web development, backend systems, desktop application (but I don't agree with the author that it is the mostly used language for this, that is probably c#), and mobile apps (for Android).

C++ can probably be used for everything but it is a hard language to learn and master. Basically anything you try will probably take a lot more time to learn than the other languages.

I don't think Python is suitable for games, mobile apps or IoT. It works for the other things. I don't even think it is very good for large backend systems but of course you can use it and some companies are using it for that. It seems to be easy to start with anyway.

823,"&gt; Language can often be reduced to syntactical sugar.

Most likely you're familiar with the languages in one family, enforcing one style of programming. If you'll switch from some procedural C/Go to OOP Java/Smalltalk or metaprogramming-rich Lisp or Meta-languages like ML/OCaml/Scala/Haskell you've notice the differences.

Practical example, imagine you are writing microservices, you are doing very typical dumb imperative logic like get the data from one place, put it into the socket and so one. But you need tracing and instrumentation. In Meta-language such program can look like this:

    do
      users &lt;- usersDao.get
      records &lt;- users
        .map { user =&gt;
          recordsDao.getRecordFor user
        }
        .transact
        .mapError {
          case NotFound =&gt; NoRecordForUser user
        }
      _ &lt;- response records
     
Where the whole program is written in an imperative object language, terms of which describe the computation and are manipulated with meta language (e.g. Scala or OCaml). 

This allows you to hide tracing, concurrency management and other implementation details under the hood of interpreter, the part which implements object language. So the program you see above contains all the needed tracing, it just passes the spans implicitly via monadic context. 

In Go or C, this would be cluttered with manual span passing, error checking, everything has to be done explicitly since the logic and interpretation details can't be abstracted from each other.

And in OOP world things are quite different too, people model programs as FSMs communicating between each other.",1649831853,programming,Freyr90,programming,Comment,236

851,"I'm not OP but I have similar experience and for me lately, if I get a choice, it's usually Rust. I've had applications in several languages continuously maintained over the same period of around 5 years now (if you count Rust), and Rust certainly has it most together with things generally just working and updates and dependency management, including libraries and the whole ecosystem, being pretty painless. Multiple versions of the same dependency can coexist in your application, and while they won't necessarily be compatible with each other, as long as you don't need to pass things from upstream version X to version Y of the same library for two different dependencies, it works perfectly.

I like using Scala but hate managing dependencies in it. Updating stuff is like herding cats - eventually you find the formula that works but it takes a while. Still, it's a good second choice, particularly as it's a little more dynamic, certain patterns are easier, and the JVM has good libraries for basically anything you could ever want.

I still like using Ruby for small stuff and scripts. But over time I've found that anything without good, strict typing is just shooting yourself in the foot in the future.

For the same reason I really prefer not to use JavaScript (even TS) if I can. Just end up with too many issues maintaining stuff, and the ecosystem rewrites things so quickly that you end up having to do a lot of edits to match library API changes, many more than feel at all reasonable. Still, sometimes I just have to.

900,"&gt; I'm saying most companies don't have an expert in any particular library, and in most places nobody knows the source code of libraries, and most places use libraries precisely to count on someone else having done part of the work.

I work at a FAANG company, any external library needs multiple experts (or owners is what we call them). They have no idea about the source-code. They can debug issues, but generally they don't, instead people using the library do the debugging. But the expert decides what is needed to be allowed to use the library, and has a way to track everyone using it. If you want to push a fix and then pull the new update, the expert needs to give it approval. It's mostly ceremonial, but when shit hits the fan, the expert is the person who best understands how *the library is used in the company*.

If someone joins the company, they think ""we should use library A"", and starts using it for their project, they become the de-facto expert on the subject.

So all you need to ensure an expert, is arbitrarily choose a person to be the gate-keeper for that dependency. Just by having that role they will become the person most knowledgeable of how that library is being used. By the sake of being an authority on how to use the library they become the expert.

People assume that an expert is someone who can answer all the questions. An expert is someone you can ask all the questions, they may not answer any, but they know how to forward them.

&gt; dependencies rarely get as much review as in-house code itself and rarely there's an ""expert"" in them in place.

You don't quite review the dependency. You trust the dependency to have a team that is sufficiently good at it (what that means is a separate issue). What you review is that you didn't have the library replaced by malicious code as a political statement. It's really more a sanity check.

What you do investigate and review is when in-house code starts using an external dependency. Unless it's being seriously misused (which again depends on your shop, and it isn't critical) it's more about just giving the ACK that the library is being used somewhere else.

&gt; Let alone cases where being an expert in the library pretty much means having highly specialized people. 

You're misunderstanding the issue here. An expert is an authority, generally by knowledge on the area. An expert on a dependency is an authority and understands a library *only as a dependency*, they know how much it's used, where and how. They understand if updating a version is a delicate procedure or something to take casually. They are the person who you contact first when a critical security bug is revealed on a dependency, and they will know who are the people you need to bring into a room.

You can also have expert AI-developers, or expert statisticians, etc. etc. They may recommend using a library, and you may choose to follow the advice and let them import them. Then they could also be your library dependency expert, as well as an expert user.

But it's perfectly fine if your expert on a library is not the most expert user. Maintaining a library and it's versions is something very different from actually using it. Lets understand what are the skills we are talking about here.

&gt; No. You're equating having no experts in each and every dependency with not having on-calls and code reviews. That would lead to bankruptcy.

There's on-calls, who will do whatever is needed to keep the system. Then there's the expert that will tell you what the impact is. You may or may not have an expert that can help you fix the problem in-house.

Think of a library expert like a driver. They can tell you when the car needs to go to a mechanic, even if they can't fix it themselves. They may also tell you who is going to need to get a cab to get home now that there isn't a car. Just like driving a car doesn't need to deeply understand how the car works, just understand what happens when it doesn't, being an expert dependency maintainer doesn't require understanding how an external dependency work, just what happens when it doesn't.

&gt; My argument is that most places don't (and can't) make a thorough review of all deps, because it's absurdly impractical. 

What is thorough? Just having a couple people check on the guarantees and limitations of the library and say ""looks good enough""? I think most can do that.

Having a deep analysis understanding what is going on inside? It kind of misses the point of a third-party library. The places that could get away with doing this deep analysis, almost always prefer to make their own in-house solution (that may be open-source), it's about as hard but you get the flexibility to modify the library as you want.

I agree that it's impractical. I disagree that it's what I'm proposing.

&gt; And environments where it's easier to depend on external code make it easier to end up with several levels of implicit deps that make it even harder to audit.

And this is the misunderstanding. This is fine for a hacky project, where you are exploring things, understanding problems, and mostly just trying to get something out.

But you don't build a house the way you build a bikeshed :). When you get thousands of dollars on the line, if not millions, you ensure first that you won't lose that money, then go to get more. A small review process, when you bring a new dependency, the reviewer will ask you why you think it's ok, you make your argument. If the dependency is already used elsewhere, you bring the guy who reviews all new use-cases of that library, the expert on that library ('s use) and have them also give it approval.

If you build your solution the way you'd build a prototype, it will explode on your face. And it'll be too expensive. After all there's a reason companies stop doing this quickly enough.",1649825848,programming,lookmeat,programming,Comment,1040

954,"&gt;Wait you mean that there are companies where if the system goes down, sometimes they'll just sit on their hands or twiddle their fingers while whistling?

No. I'm saying most companies don't have an expert in any particular library, and in most places nobody knows the source code of libraries, and most places use libraries precisely to count on someone else having done part of the work. When the bug is in the library, most places either look if upstream solved it, work around the issue or switch libraries. Because most libraries are external.

Note I'm not at all shitting on NPM and related stuff, I'm pointing out that dependencies rarely get as much review as in-house code itself and rarely there's an ""expert"" in them in place. Not at least at the level you describe where you'd talk to them about bugs in the library, rather than misuse of it.

Let alone cases where being an expert in the library pretty much means having highly specialized people. An expert in TensorFlow doesn't just need to be a good programmer, it needs to be a statistician to truly understand the problem domain that this friendly framework abstracts. An expert in NumPy would need a very solid understanding of linear algebra, floating point representation and operations, memory layout, data structures, all while keeping in mind the idiosyncracies of both C, Python, Cython and probably FORTRAN. Good luck finding such an expert that doesn't happen to be part of the upstream project.

&gt;Places that don't have this go bankrupt because of an outage. Basically it's a business that has a perfectly possible situation they simply have no way to handle. This is what you're saying. I'm sure they exist, I doubt they do for long enough to be of any notable count.

No. You're equating having no experts in each and every dependency with not having on-calls and code reviews. That would lead to bankruptcy.

&gt;And for that, let's bring this back to the original argument. NDB is a library that is severely misused by a lot of people, resulting in a series of mishaps. Contrary to your argument there are a lot of places that have very sensible and decent, if humble and simple, release pipes.

My argument is that most places don't (and can't) make a thorough review of all deps, because it's absurdly impractical. And environments where it's easier to depend on external code make it easier to end up with several levels of implicit deps that make it even harder to audit. I'm not saying it's intrinsically a bad thing, it's got its pros and its cons.

&gt;It's easy to be edgy and say ""everyone is doing it wrong"" and then just go deeper into that, but I know a more of people working in tech, and beyond the guy who is working on a IT dept for a company, their focus being configuring systems and keeping everything running, who may have a script or small tool they built in the side, a lot of places end up having a good enough solution.

975,"Everything trades some problems for different sets of problems. There's no silver bullet or free meal.

What I mention of not being suitable in older times has to do with one of them, which is sloooooooow build times. Like, for big stuff it can get comically slow. While there are optimization in progress that can make a huge difference, it's always trading something. Those optimizations IIRC mostly sacrifice storage, which now abounds but back then was awfully expensive. In terms of toolchain resource usage Rust isn't even in the same ballpark as C. But what C has of cheap, it has of risky.

The main reason it's slow is the reason why it helps solve problems, it puts a lot of work into making sure stuff types, and typing Rust is hard because it also involves guaranteeing lifetimes and guaranteeing only one thread can at any point write to an object.

It's much more effort intensive than high level languages, but it gives me some peace of mind that it forces me to contemplate all error cases, ensures lifetimes are correct and all that compared to using C when I'd need to use C (and, unless you're programming for fun, I think you should only use it when otherwise you'd use C).

Note I'm not a guru either, I had a little bit of interaction at my job and for some personal ""scripts"", but nothing really big. My experience is probably the same as any newbie in the language, a non-trivial learning curve but some clear wins in ergonomics. I don't consider myself an evangelist of Rust. It's a significant improvement over C that we now have the privilege to use thanks to machines now being able to keep up. FWIW, I keep hearing ADA had all the niceties of Rust decades ago, but I think there was a lack of free high-quality tooling that discouraged adoption.

What it solves is precisely issues you'd have when programming C, memory leaks, out of bounds accesses, undefined behavior (Rust only allows UB inside unsafe blocks, safe code won't build if it triggers UB), lack of a good library of data structures (rolling your own gets old fast and is error-prone, and dealing with external dependencies is annoying at best), all while being pretty much a match performance-wise and being (almost?) as powerful as C. To fully replace C you'll need to write unsafe code, tho, and in those blocks it's up to the programmer to make sure none of the dirty parts leak to safe code. Let's say Rust mostly encapsulates the problem, as it's impossible to truly eliminate it.

Regarding big projects, there's always Firefox having parts written in Rust (it was created specifically for that), there are some big-but-hobby projects I know of as well, such as Redox, a Unix-like OS (I think for research?) that's been in progress for at least 5 years IIRC, there's Hubris which is an OS for embedded (I think that's more focused in production actually).  Firecracker, the micro VM AWS uses for their EC2 instances, is implemented in Rust. Somewhat shyly it seems we might soon see some Rust in the Linux kernel, tho don't expect a full rewrite even in the coming decades (it's not even on the table, but rather they're evaluating allowing it for drivers and other places).

Then, where I work there are teams working in some crypto verifiers or something like that (I'd give more details but I don't remember what is already public and what isn't, so I'd rather not breach contract; it's not my team in any case, so I may even be inaccurate if I do), an embedded project for gas meters for agriculture, bare metal in microcontrollers, my own work is about real time ad bidding and we have some services written in Rust. I'm not sure any of those count as big (probably not), but they're real-world profitable applications, so I think they're still relevant. FWIW, the bidding ones handle *a lot* of data, so they just might count as large-ish scale too.

But, there are some things which can only be learned by making much larger projects, which require new heights of organization. Those are things I don't have much experience with.

I'm not entirely sure what the main point of the article was and I'm not sure that I agree with the clear points you *did* make.

&gt; Why do I need validation?

I don't. I could give two shits if you like Rust. I like it because it's pretty much the language I would have designed if I were smarter. It has pretty much all the features that I think are neat and groovy in a language. I'm not doing this because I want some sort of external validation and I recognize that other people might have a different calculus and want different things so I'm not going to go out into the street and try to convert people, but if someone says ""I want C or C++, but without the ability to shoot myself in the foot"" then we have something. If they want to program web pages then you *can* use Rust, but I don't know that I'd recommend it.

If the article had been ""A defense of older languages"" then you might have something. There are lessons to be learned from C (which isn't really all that old, tbh) and Fortran (which really is) and I've seen modern programming languages that make mistakes that make me think that we haven't learned much in the intervening decades.

Or talk about how these neat new features require additional cognitive load and how maybe the benefit isn't worth the cost (writing Rust is *hard*. At least at the beginning). That's possible.

Obviously you're going to pull in production dependencies because I'm sure it's very rare to use React from a `&lt;script&gt;` tag, but it's interesting that React out-of-the-box doesn't mandate anything. I don't think it would be possible to build a ""React standard library"". 

Angular installs 11 direct npm dependencies on a new project (no additional transitive dependencies). 9 are under the @angular organization (including zone.js) and the remaining two are `rxjs` and `tslib`. `rxjs` is a popular library outside of Angular as well, so it's probably not possible to include that in a theoretical ""Angular standard library"".

1118,"You seem to have a weird definition of prescriptive. Where have I prescribed any particular pattern, except for encapsulation which isn't a DDD pattern, but a basic design principle. 

DDD has plenty of concrete patterns, which i didn't bring up because I'm not prescribing anything but speaking as generically as possible. DDD has very specific patterns like Aggregate Roots, which define a specific organizational pattern for designing compound data structures, ensuring data integrity by only allowing manipulation through functions on the Aggregate Root. DDD also prescribes that Aggregate Roots should only be instantiated through Repositories. There are some other concrete patterns like Context Mapping, which specifies that data should not be shared between Bounded Contexts, but instead there should be a formal mapping to ensure that Contexts stay Bounded.

You're only talking about Value types, which can be shared because they are literally vocabulary. 

The actual business processes are coordinated by Entity types, which hide state, which is the engine that drives the business process. However state is defined (mutable or immutable), it must be hidden to ensure that business processes operate independently, by ensuring that no business process knows too much about others.

This is why static methods are useless in languages like Java except as utility functions. Functional programming languages have other ways of encapsulating state, particularly through closures.

Also, thinking of classes as nouns is not a particularly useful way of looking at classes. Ward Cunningham came with a much better formula called CRC (Class-Responsibility-Coordination). Classes are participants in business processes, each having a specific responsibility. Methods define how the participants coordinate with each other. Thus, classes define business processes. 

Which boils down to the point I've been making all along. I don't care about data, or more specifically I care more about defining the business processes, which is the essence of DDD. Data plays a supporting role, in that data is a carrier of business value that has no independent importance on its own.",1649813010,programming,_shorug0ru_,programming,Comment,328

1167,"You misunderstand me. I really like DDD, but your version of it is extremely prescriptive, whereas my version of it is way more *descriptive*.

There are no concrete *patterns* in DDD. There are only *objectives* and a few *principles* to help you find a reasonable path to achieve those objectives. Patterns are more language-specific and style-specific. Data encapsulation is a pattern, not a principle.

 When it comes to data types and the distinction between domain types and implementation details, I think you‚Äôre right about the concept of hiding implementation details. But IMO you should very rarely hide domain-related types. Just expose them. They want to be known and understood. You don‚Äôt need to worry about whether or not you should ‚Äúsupport‚Äù them. You support them already as part of your domain.

To the extent that you feel like a class is too tightly coupled with concrete data types, perhaps you would be better off using the module pattern with a bunch of static functions. That way you don‚Äôt have to think in terms of a noun with its own specific operations, and can instead think about sets of tools for cleanly manipulating your data. If you‚Äôve used Haskell, this is almost the default way of doing things.

If you want to know what I think about specific patterns in OOP languages, I think this video roughly sums up my views, although I don‚Äôt agree with everything he says:

1284,"&gt; ""helping people grow""

There shouldn't be any irony in this. Many new grads don't understand how to plan their career growth, how to balance work/life, or even how to do basic financial planning, especially if they are the first in their family to enter a high paying field like software engineering.

Part of being a manger is teaching all of those things. (One of my managers would always tell his college hires to not go out and buy a fancy new car!)

&gt;  ""large influential, customer focused, product decisions""

Writing code is what we all do. Designing software that people want to use is a much, much, harder problem.

It is cross-discipline, and it also involves being able to understand the needs of users, who may have very life experiences than you.

To give an example, I designed a feature that helped alert parents when it was time to re-apply sunscreen on their children. No kids, living in Seattle, I worked hard to design a user flow that was all about helping make a real positive impact in the lives of people who were living a very different lifestyle than me!

But I only had the opportunity to do that because I had played politics to get myself into a position where when leadership said ""do something with UV"" I was able to make a proposal like ""we should do UV monitoring and tell people when to re-apply sunscreen"" and then push that proposal through to completion, including business logic, sitting in UX design meetings, and assigning an engineer on my team to implement it.

1326,"&gt; Look dude, literally nothing I said implied that I‚Äôm discarding the ‚Äústories‚Äù of how the business operates.

Really?

&gt;&gt; No story-telling.

.

&gt; What do you think it means to model domain types?

What do *you* think it means to model the domain types?

According to DDD, there are two types of domain types: entities and values. 

Values are data without behavior. The don't tell any stories, but bundle related data together that are related in a context. Such as a point having X and Y coordinates.

Entitles have behavior, and tell the stories.

In OOP, this is done through classes (reference types). In other programming paradigms, it's something else.

&gt; You don‚Äôt have to make your code read like a story of business processes

You should. That's the Ubiquitous Language, which tells you what the code does in context of the business.

The DDD book gives a good example of why this is important. Consider a batch job to run some calculations on accounts. The programmers wrote the batch job in the way that made most technical sense to them, but it read like anything you see in an accounting context. Of course it didn't, because the programmers didn't understand accounting principles. 

The business asked for an enhancement, but the enhancement doesn't fit with how the batch job was written, and the programmers were saying that it will take a good amount of time to refactor the system to work with the requirement. The business didn't understand why, it's a simple enhancement.

One programmer decided to go to the bookstore and buy a book on accounting principles to understand what the batch job was supposed to be doing. As it turns out, the business was right. It should have been an easy enhancement. If the code had been written in a way that made accounting sense instead of programmer sense, it would have been easy to add the new feature.

&gt; YOUR CODE and THE MACHINE it runs on are literally part of the business domain

The machine is an implementation detail. It shouldn't be relevant to the business logic, since you can literally swap out the machine. If the business logic isn't portable across implementations, you've instantly created legacy code that will probably take major rewrites to move to another platform, incurring an unnecessary cost to the business.

&gt; You cannot abstract away an entire database.

This statement doesn't make any sense. If I have a Point class, does it matter that the point might be stored in a database? If I have some code does some calculations on points, but doesn't deal with storage, does it matter that the data is ultimately stored in a database?

The database is abstracted away *all the time*. There will be places where the database matters and there will be places where it doesn't.

&gt; It turns out YOUR domain as a software engineer is managing data.

Yes, and also the business processes.

&gt; But I guarantee everyone on your team will need to look inside those methods to figure out what they are doing

Yeah, so? I look into the methods of a lot of things. I have to deal with a lot of abstractions, not just the ones in the software that I'm writing, but also in the frameworks and libraries that I'm using.

&gt; the lack of visibility at the level of data types

Data types aren't databases. 

Most of the time, I don't really how the libraries I use are implemented, just as long as they work. As a Java developer, I access the database through JDBC, but only rarely do I actually care about what the JDBC driver is doing internally.

&gt; prevents people from understanding the actual process that is happening

At which level? Most of the time, I don't need to know what happens in the full stack. I don't have visibility into the internals of the operating system or the internals of the database either.

The point of abstractions is that you can isolate details to the level of the problem you're solving. Otherwise, the signal can get lost in the noise.

Back in the bad days of JSP, people would mix presentation, calculations and queries into the same JSP file, and depending on how badly the JSP page was written, finding the part that I actually needed to change, and changing it without breaking something unrelated could be a nightmare. It turns out isolating presentation, calculations and queries makes figuring out what's going on and changing things a lot easier.

&gt; Honestly all you need is a plain user object and a couple of functions that take a user object to give you the data you need for the next stage of the process.

What process? In which context is this data being used, and what business process is being served by it?",1649802746,programming,_shorug0ru_,programming,Comment,812

Not saying in some cases it isn't like that, but for the most part I think it's because everything we build at a time, we build with the tools available at that time, and most projects really predate current trendy languages. You can't just throw all your current OSes that had millions of dollars invested and covered lots of corner cases that you're probably going to rediscover if you rewrite, all of your financial infrastructure, all of the bigger backend systems, etc. Reality is most of the actually profitable work around is maintenance, it's not inventing but keeping something working. And that something isn't Rust/Elixir/whatever better language we have now.

I specially find the ""if they spent more time writing it they wouldn't need to praise it"" argument uncompelling. Rust wasn't born out of someone's whim, it reflects the fact we needed better tools to deal with actual problems for which the tools were designed with different tradeoffs in mind (Rust might be all magnificent now with our multicore multigigabyte computers, but it wouldn't have ran sufficiently fast in a NeXT workstation when Doom was in the works, because it has just too much work to do). More experience writing concurrent code will still not make you immune to data races and deadlocks in the way ensuring single ownership formally does (I'm aware there are some ways to trigger bad behavior regarding this in Rust tho, but it's still much more ""planets align"" than C's problems).

I do share the argument of not using systems languages outside of the domains where they are appropriate. The case of the static site is a marvelous example because the real optimization comes from not performing any kind of dynamic operation in the backend at all.

Rust people say atomics are synchronization. Everything I seen says data synchronization is locking data between two points which isnt what happens in rust

1514,"Hundreds of things are going on here, all of which deserve separate discussion.

1. **All languages suck, but some suck more.** C has null pointers and C-strings and fucked-up integer sizing bugs; plus it pushes you to develop your own structs every time you need a data structure‚Äîa hundred more lines, just to make a hash-map. Haskell, which requires 14 language extensions to be usable, can be extended in such a way that type inference is literally, formally undecidable. Scala's compilation times are atrocious. Lisp's problem can be summarized in nine characters: "")))))))))"". Python is a slow, glorified scripting language. And these are the flaws in the good ones, that actually fill their niche well‚ÄîI haven't even listed actual bad languages (e.g., Javascript, Java, C++ if you use OO). These things are old and crufty but, as the OP contends, they mostly work... uh, most of the time.
2. **Maintenance is made worse by ""improving"" a language.** When a language is upgraded, more things become possible and writing code in it becomes more pleasant‚Äîif you're working on new code, you prefer today's C++ over that of the mid-2000s‚Äîbut maintaining code in it often gets worse because now there are more dialects and even idiolects‚Äîand, if the MBAs have hired Scrum monkeys, also idio**t**lects‚Äîwithin the field. Java is a lot less horrible than it used to be, due to modernization, but the maintenance burden hasn't changed much, because all the shitty ways of doing things are still very popular in enterprise circles.
3. **The ""best"" programming language depends on what you're doing.** If you're dealing with business logic that changes all the time, you don't want to be using C‚Äîit's intricate, it's potentially unsafe, and it's too difficult for the types of programmers who (quite frankly) can't get themselves assigned to anything better than business logic. If you're writing an operating system or a 3D game, don't use Python. It's very domain-specific what the ""best"" language is‚Äîand I say this as one who used to be an aggressive functional programming enthusiast, but who aged enough to appreciate the value that ""other"" languages provide. Getting the language right matters a lot, but it's not always the same one. Most programmers don't know enough to make this call; in the corporate world, the percentage is probably 1 to 2 percent. (In FAANGs, maybe 3‚Äì5 percent. Maybe.)
4. **Using the wrong language causes pain, but is rarely fatal to the business, so executives don't care.** Getting your PL wrong is going to cause a lot of issues: bad source code, slow execution, unreliable toolchain. These issues will lead to workarounds and kludge mitosis. Legacy burdens will grow quickly. You know who doesn't care? Product managers and executives, who define success as being able to get promoted away before anyone figures out the clever ways they have externalized costs enough to call them out on the messes they have made. No one whose definition of success is having his boss's boss's job in 3 years cares about code quality. These people are terrified of ""weird"" languages that will make it difficult or expensive to hire programmers, but they are not afraid of making generally poor language decisions if their choices are the same as everyone else's.
5. **There is, unfortunately, a political aspect to this, which is all most managers see.** Software shops tend to have a Pareto distribution in terms of productivity‚Äîbut instead of it being ""80/20"" it might be 90/10. The 10% of programmers who appear to be doing 90% of the work‚Äînote that the metrics used to assess productivity are usually extremely flawed, and gameable‚Äîwill continue getting the best projects with the greenest fields, and they will continue to beat the productivity metrics. The beta losers (even if they do a lot more work than it appears) will continue getting maintenance jobs where they keep up with changes made by the alphas (and because they have to invest time and energy in keeping up with what others are doing, they have less of a chance to make their own imprint). The status ordering usually isn't correlated highly with actual talent or skill‚Äîunless there's an extreme talent inversion, any ordering is metastable‚Äîand the most effective way to reshuffle it with yourself on top is to drive adoption for a new toolchain that you already know better than anyone else. Thus, even if you're advocating for a PL change or rearchitecture on solid technical grounds, the manager's ""instinct"" is going to tell him that you're just doing this to lead the team‚Äîand that's not a good look. Managers are used to this; every software team seems to have at least one programmer who says every week that the whole codebase sucks and needs to be rewritten from the ground up‚Äîand he may he even be right, but it doesn't matter‚Äîin Rust or Clojure or OCaml. Software engineering is full of scabs who have no sense of worker solidarity, and thus every software manager hears ""Our code is unusable garbage written by unemployable morons, and I have just the solution to all your problems"" about three times a day.
6. **Even if a PL change will solve all technical problems, there's a good chance of this ruining your life.** There's something like Amdahl's Law here, where you reach diminishing returns because the inefficient, ugly piece of work doesn't budge even when you speed up everything else. Perhaps your miracle language QRS really *will* improve developer productivity by a factor of 10 (more likely, with those ""10x"" functional programming languages, it's 1.5-2.5x). Guess what? Now you're spending less time doing real work, and more of your time will be eaten up by justifying work to the boneheads in charge. Oh, and half your team will be fired, because productivity gains haven't gone to workers since the 1970s‚Äîthey go into executive coffers. Maybe the people using ""bad"" languages and writing software that requires massive support teams were the smart ones all along.

TL;DR: No programming language can fix capitalism (which truly is a blight that ought to be nuked into oblivion from orbit). If you want to be a great programmer, you'll have to learn a bunch of them, and multiple paradigms‚Äîeven the ugly ones like OOP that you'll only learn to understand why they suck‚Äîtoo; no shortcuts there.

What do you think it means to name your functions appropriately? All of that is just assumed. OF COURSE you care about how the business operates.

BUT‚Ä¶

You don‚Äôt have to make your code read like a story of business processes. You simply don‚Äôt. And that CERTAINLY should not be the criteria for how you create abstractions.

At the end of the day, your code runs on a machine. YOUR CODE and THE MACHINE it runs on are literally part of the business domain, and part of the business domain is making their machines do the correct things and send data to the correct places.

You cannot abstract away an entire database. Trying to do so will only lead to suffering down the road. It turns out YOUR domain as a software engineer is managing data. That‚Äôs the core responsibility you have. If wrapping things up with classes so you can write `User.authenticateSelf().assignToCategory(‚Äúblah‚Äù)` helps you reason about your code, then you do you. But I guarantee everyone on your team will need to look inside those methods to figure out what they are doing, so while the abstraction does declare your intent, the lack of visibility at the level of data types prevents people from understanding the actual process that is happening, which they need to know in order to write their own code.

1578,"He does not get to the root cause. Here it comes:

At some point in the development, the developer wants better tools.

This begs the question, using what tool, should you write the better tool?

And how should the better tool be designed?

Normally, people will use something close to the most low-level they know, as long as it's not overly difficult (e.g. assembly). E.g. they will use C++ (or C#).

That is, *if they know C++*.

Modern web developers know JavaScript. And that's it. Maybe PHP. *They don't know C, Pascal, Ada, C++, or whatever.* Maybe they are on Linux, where C# isn't an obvious choice.

So they write their tools, which should improve on JavaScript, *in JavaScript*. And it will be designed *like JavaScript* (e.g. TypeScript, React JSX).

And herein lies the problem. This creates thicker layers than necessary.

Further, as they only know dynamic languages, they, 
- do not know
- do not care
- are afraid of
- are struggling with
- do not appreciate
and
- are unable to be productive in
static languages.

Thus, the tools they write, to solve the problem with their dynamic language, is written in the problem language, and layers on top of the problem language, thereby thickening the problem. 

The new tool will be designed in the same way as the old tool (as these programmers do not know of other ways of doing things), and will have the same problems as the old tool.

The only solution is better education of programmers (teach static and dynamic typing, teach computational complexity, teach parsing, teach asm/C/LLVMIR output), and higher standards for reliability and performance.

That way, when programmers make new tools, the new tools will be better.",1649793319,programming,tabbekavalkade,programming,Comment,287

1659,"What does ""extension"" mean in context?

It means inheritance. Not extensibility in general, but specifically class style inheritance like what you see in Java and C#. (This is where Java got the `extends` keyword.)

Back when Meyer introduced the concept of OCP, inheritance was still a relatively new and people wanted to use it as a solution for every problem. 

The problem Meyer wanted to solve was fragile base classes. When people added a new method to a class, it could potentially break all of the subclasses. 

So Meyer's idea was don't change the base class. When he said ""Closed for modification"" he means don't make any changes to the class. You can fix bugs, but you can't add, remove, or alter functionality.

So how do you add new functionality? You make every class inheritable. Then you put the new functionality in a new subclass.

Again, look at Java and how they made every method virtual by default. This was very much a 90's era idea of OCP and extreme inheritance.

****

Then the backlash happened. People started shouting ""prefer composition over inheritance"" because they couldn't deal with the overly deep inheritance trees. Some even said we should ban inheritance entirely.

***

And then Robert Martin revived it when he threw together his 11 principles of OOP. (Yes 11. He discarded half of them because SOLID was such a cool acronym that he wanted to focus on it for his branding.)

I'm not even sure Robert Martin understood what Meyer's OCP meant. He could have been just used it because he needed to pad out his blog post.

***

Since the original OCP design patterns are no longer accepted, the term has been redefined to be something vague about extensibility in general. Take any extensibility pattern, even ones that have nothing to do with inheritance or even OOP in general, and SOLID fanboys will say its OCP.",1649791228,programming,grauenwolf,programming,Comment,317

You do know there are five concepts and that's just an acronym, right?

the L from that one is from: The Liskov substitution principle is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called strong behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1988 conference keynote address titled Data abstraction and hierarchy.

So I'd like to know how you think of an article ""introducing"" the concept when neither of those concepts were new in any way when Bob ""first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns"".

2. One new sentence

Repeat a few times, then the song is over.

For example, *Stormy Monday* by T-Bone Walker is literally just the lyrics below, but it's a two and a half minute song because the lyrics are said slowly and there is plenty of instrumental music before, after and between the verses:

1750,"&gt; Drinking the OOP koolaid has caused nothing but pain for basically every enterprise OOP-based project I‚Äôve ever worked on.

I'm not talking about OOP. But, for what it's worth, what has caused pain in most enterprise projects that I've worked on is the lack of OOP. Particularly, the [Anemic Domain Model](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html).

&gt; Most server-side software is basically just moving data from the database to the client machine, and vice versa.

This perspective is fundamentally the problem. Most server-side software is implementing business processes. Everything you stated serves the business, and must fit in the narrative. Not a single thing you mentioned has any value outside of how it is applied to solving a business problem. A data validation framework is an intellectual curiosity until it is applied to solve a problem. Which means the narrative must be clearly articulated.

You might as well say that economies don't exist, and it's pointless to talk about macroeconomics, because at the end of the day, the ""economy"" is just a bunch of people moving pieces of paper around which have perceived value.

The projects that went really well basically abandoned half of the OO design patterns in favor of keeping things dead simple until it was absolutely necessary to put it behind an abstraction.

Most server-side software is basically just moving data from the database to the client machine, and vice versa. The rest is mostly decoding/encoding, validation, and authentication. When the data is being transformed by your program, you should use domain types and understand what that data is used for and where it needs to go. And that‚Äôs about it. Following those rules alone will cut down the number of classes/interfaces you have by more than half, probably more than 75%. And your entire program will be easier to understand as a result.

On the front end, it‚Äôs a similar story, although your data types include DOM elements (or ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù DOM elements. This is why I prefer React over other FE frameworks. Everything you do in React is just transforming your domain-level data into DOM objects for display. No need to have a bunch of ‚Äúdoers of things‚Äù and ‚Äúmanagers of things‚Äù except in a tiny handful of cases. It‚Äôs just an arrow from the business data to the data you need for UI presentation, plus a little bit of form logic for user input.

1781,"&gt; You just don‚Äôt need little object machines that tell a story. 

The little object machines are meant to manage state. If you're not doing OOP, that's fine. Other programming paradigms will have other ways for managing and encapsulating state. That's a story that still has to be told, but other programming paradigms have other ways of telling the story.

&gt; Notice how the core ‚Äúabstractions‚Äù in this scenario are literally just the domain types, the names for data transformations, and the frameworks that support the types of computations you want to perform.

Yes, exactly. Which require forethought to come up with, which is the entire point.

&gt; No story-telling.

Yes, there is still story telling. That's the point that you are missing. The ""story"" is what the business does. Most developers never bother learning the story. So they don't capture the story in the code in whatever form they are using. And if you don't know the plot, you can't add to the story in a coherent way.

&gt; It‚Äôs all about the data.

No, it's about the business processes.

&gt; My main beef is with unnecessary data encapsulation. 

Data encapsulation is a corollary to business process encapsulation. 

&gt;  If you encapsulate all your data, you will have no idea what is going on. 

When you interact with other teams (or even other people in general), do you need to know everything that is going? Or, do you make agreements with people, come up with a contract for the interaction, and let people fulfill the agreements without worrying about how they do it?

That's the point of encapsulation. By hiding data, you are only exposing information on a need to know basis. This means that you don't become dependent on particular implementations, allowing those implementations to freely change as long as the contract is fulfilled.

&gt;  But if your data becomes opaque, then your system‚Äôs behavior and purpose becomes opaque.

Opaque is good. No one except those involved in the sausage making process need to know how the sausage is made.",1649786275,programming,_shorug0ru_,programming,Comment,342

A lot of my music is old mp3's (remember, this is over the course of decades, predating streaming services) and some of my music is out of print and not available on streaming services.  I've been able to cobble together some of my library into playlists in my Napster streaming service account in recent years and made them shareable, but admittedly, there are some tracks in there I haven't purged yet, so the curation's not as good.

I realize Napster's pretty unpopular as a service, so this is perhaps not useful to most, but here is a link to the ""everything"" playlist that pulls in all the stuff I've found matching my main library (around 80 tunes, but for some reason it doesn't show all the music on the public side):

[http://us.napster.com/playlist/mp.283104622?ocode=social\_user&amp;pcode=social\_user&amp;cpath=Link&amp;rsrc=playlist](http://us.napster.com/playlist/mp.283104622?ocode=social_user&amp;pcode=social_user&amp;cpath=Link&amp;rsrc=playlist)

A lot of my mp3 library is made up of recordings of ""Music from the Hearts of Space"" radio show, which has been playing electronic and ambient music since the 80s, and the albums they've released over the years.  It's not all fit for purpose, but most often it's non-vocal.  They have a subscription service that lets you listen to their archive shows.  I recommend these episodes to start:

* 457 - Plasma Waves
* 346- Ice
* 415 - Between Two Worlds
* 551 - Wunjo Revisited
* 568 - Urban Source Code

1866,"Just to clarify, I think DDD is very compatible with what I‚Äôm talking about. You can have data types. You just don‚Äôt need little object machines that tell a story. You need to transform data in the following permutations:

-	raw unknown data to domain types
-	domain types to domain types
-	domain types to data that is formatted for the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù (DB, file system, external server/client, the React Virtual DOM, etc.).

Notice how the core ‚Äúabstractions‚Äù in this scenario are literally just the domain types, the names for data transformations, and the frameworks that support the types of computations you want to perform. No need for a huge mess of classes that are intended to act like little robots doing abstract jobs. No story-telling.

It‚Äôs all about the data. You take the data you *have*, and you figure out how to transform it into the data you *need*, and to the extent that an abstraction helps make that process more clear, by all means use it.

My main beef is with unnecessary data encapsulation. If you encapsulate all your data, you will have no idea what is going on. Stick to raw data classes/structs and functions that transform them. For non-domain data, like interval counters or bookkeeping for some algorithm, hide that all you want.

When code is written at a low level of abstraction, when new features are added, the next developer has to reverse engineer the business context and without any other abstractions to guide them, only add to the mess.

2 - The only nugets I depend on at the moment are mongodb drivers, azure sdks, postgresql drivers, mysql drivers, and so on. None of which have idiotic left-pad like dependencies, because in contrast to javascript, .NET is a professional platform and has an actual stdlib, hence trivial one-liner packages don't exist.

3 - updating nuget dependencies is generally done in a per-package basis, and ONLY when it is actually required due to some bug fix or feature in a newer version that that you actually need for your code.

4 - hijacking nuget packages cannot be done like you could (until very recently?) do in npm. A package id is owned by an author.

5 - Doing the ""similar name"" trick is harder in nuget because of the naming convention. It's not like you will install some packaged named ""foojs"" or anything like that.

My point is people are almost universally BAD at writing abstractions, especially on their first pass at the problem. No matter how good you think you are at it, you‚Äôre probably not great at it.

Out of curiosity, how are you defining a ""comparable"" Ruby project? You're running Ruby in the browser somehow?

JavaScript runs **everywhere**. It runs in modern browsers, in old browsers, in Android WebView, in Android browsers, in iOS browsers that are actually all Webkit because Apple, on the server with multiple different runtimes, on desktop applications, on IoT devices (yes really, if performance isn't critical then the event-driven nature of JS is a decent fit), and bundled with native mobile applications (ex. React Native). More diversity in where the code runs is going to naturally lead to a more decentralized language and ecosystem.

Possibly you think JavaScript's ""standard library"" is too small which leads to the proliferation of packages. What would you define as the ""standard library""? Do you mean NodeJS standard library?

More pressure to avoid the massive transient dependency trees that cause this problem.

But no liability doesn't mean they're not at fault. It just means they don't bear the responsibility.

&gt; And yes, devs should exercise some caution in their dependency choices. But that's easier said than done.

Sure but my point being is that the ""they're at fault"" comes with an implied ""ergo we don't have to change our ways"", and thus nothing ever gets done about it besides some fingerpointing at the ""bad evil dev"".

There were more talks on quantum computing (one) than talks on monoliths (zero). Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith. 

Ye, because building a simple monolith CRUD is such a riveting topic for a tech conference. I can't think of a single reason why you'd talk about more complex things other than bias against monoliths.

An extensive backup doesn't mean quick to restore.

Depending on what was actually run, the ""normal"" backups might have been deleted and now you're at 48 hour turnarounds for getting the data from amazon (assuming you konw what data you need). AWS has internal limits too, this stuff is _slow_ to create at a small to medium scale, it's probably hours of terraform scripts run in batches to try and avoid any fallout to anyone who has already been restored.

Services like RDS have limited replication when starting up, so they're likely unusable for hours at a time as they're being brought online, and once your infra is online, _then_ you can begin to import data and app state.

2322,"&gt;So, how does that take weeks?

Because a restore of a product made up of 20 different add-ons isn't as simple as:

    cp ./backup ./prod

When everything is decentralized - across multiple databases and systems - the restoration has to go in stages to make sure that every system stays ""sane"" at each step relative to every other system so that the end result functions as intended.

I get that from [Track storage and move data across products](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/track-storage-and-move-data-across-products/):

&gt;**Can Atlassian‚Äôs RDS backups be used to roll back changes?**  
&gt;  
&gt;We cannot use our RDS backups to roll back changes. These include changes such as fields overwritten using scripts, or deleted issues, projects, or sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is because our data isn‚Äôt stored in a single central database. **Instead, it is stored across many micro services, which makes rolling back changes a risky process.**  
&gt;  
&gt;To avoid data loss, we recommend making regular backups. For how to do this, see our documentation:  
&gt;  
&gt;Confluence ‚Äì [Create a site backup](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-a-site-backup)  
&gt;  
&gt;Jira products ‚Äì [Exporting issues](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/export-issues)

It's often a question of aesthetics, of cleanliness and academic purity under the guise that it makes you productive. And so more often than not, people fit the domain to the paradigm rather than fitting the paradigm to the domain.

I wouldn't say it's just a FP thing. I think thats a wrong way of describing it. It's an industry thing. Functional just happens to be the stick most of the time.

2368,"I guess I have a problem with how you are defining ‚Äúintuitive.‚Äù

As a practical matter, people find certain concepts intuitive purely out of familiarity and inertia. That‚Äôs all about the context of an individual and a situation they find themselves in. It‚Äôs not inherent to the language itself. Those are qualities that are specific to the individual.

It‚Äôs just like learning Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese with ease, and then slamming into a wall with Japanese. If you‚Äôve ever taken a course on linguistics, you‚Äôll know that, under the hood, all human language families have essentially the exact same semantic structure, but the grammar is merely shifted around, and words have different physical manifestations. All human languages are fundamentally equivalent. But they have evolved over time in a tree-like structure of ‚Äúfamilies,‚Äù and it‚Äôs usually easier to learn a new language if you stay within your linguistic family.

I think programming languages are similar. They are all capable of expressing any kind of logical proof (assuming infinite time and space). The only difference is that, out of all the infinite ways to construct a programming language, a tiny handful have some direct correspondence with physical systems. And those are the languages we find most practical and useful.

So if you happened to learn one of the more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù programming languages early on (presumably to get industrial work done), as most people did, then yeah, you, as a person, might find other imperative languages easier to learn than functional ones. But that‚Äôs more a function of you and your circumstances, not something inherent to the language itself.

Anyway, I happen to know both imperative and functional languages pretty well, and in some cases I find functional programming ti be a better fit for the kinds of things I want to express, and yes, on a *real computer*. And performance is rarely an issue. Was it hard to learn a functional language at first? Absolutely. It took me a year or so to become comfortable with it, in contrast to the two week learning curve of C# or Python. But all it took was getting over that first hump with ReasonML (basically just OCaml with C-style syntax), and then other languages like Haskell and Lisp just cam naturally.

And just to give you a sense of where I‚Äôm coming from, I work for a company that uses TypeScript and Haskell building cybersecurity software. It works great. We make plenty of money. FP is an asset to us, not a liability.",1649754970,programming,ScientificBeastMode,programming,Comment,418

2379,"The issue here is a fundamental difference in perspective. I'm coming from an engineering perspective not an academic one. A descriptivist versus a perspecriptivist so to speak. I need the computer to solve a problem as quickly as possible in the simplest way. And whatever works, works. The formal system of computation doesn't matter, just what is practically applicable. So in a sense a turing machine is not an accident. It was the simplest possible solution to the problem at the time based on the resources available. (I also suspect its the simplest because it's actually easier to write aswell which is partly why it was chosen). It was the better option.

Formal systems of logic really has nothing to do with it. Because computers aren't actually turing machines. They are just based on them. Really they are a mutation of theory based on what is practically possible and based on certain goals.

So yes, imperative is more intuitive because it produces simpler solutions based on the fact the hardware is designed for that. The hardware is designed that way because it's the easiest way to design a computer. It's not just a matter of fashion. That we chose turing over lambda. It's a matter of neccessity. Lambda calculus is incongruent to how computers are currently constructed.

So is it really an accident? It turns out that cosmically speaking, turing machines are actually easier to make and program based on our current circumstance. 

The equivalence you are talking about only exists at a high high level. But even then I suspect imperative was chosen because it was actually the easiest to write.

From my perspective, nothing about the laws of the universe mandate that Turing machines as we understand them today are necessary for computing *in general*.

At the end of the day, it happened to be useful and so we, as a society, settled on the most useful thing we could think of and implement at the time. And thus it carried forward to the present day.

But from a cosmic perspective, to the extent that *logic* has any real basis in the laws of the universe, imperative and functional programming languages are perfectly equivalent. It just turned out, by an ‚Äúaccident of the history of the universe,‚Äù that we found mechanical‚Äîand later electrical‚ÄîTuring machines to be the most feasible way to automate computation.

But it wasn‚Äôt the first way we figured out how to compute things. Another model exists: the biological model. The animal brain (and potentially other biological systems) are capable of computing as well, and we don‚Äôt yet have a machine equivalent of that yet.

All I‚Äôm saying is that you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúimperative languages are inherently more intuitive because hardware is what it is.

2386,"Why do people insist on using the word ""architecture"" when talking about their system design? Does it make them feel more important?

For distributed systems, complexity is the enemy of reliability. I interview applicants for engineering leadership roles and the most common mistake they make is to _add_ components when they run into trouble (which just creates more failure modes) instead of backing up and trying to solve the problem in a different way. In other words, the way they think about the problem is the problem.

Engineers often add requirements to their designs that are not strictly necessary, but which they believe are important. A person can make a pretty good career out of fixing systems like this; start by asking, ""ok, what MUST it do?"" Often the list is fairly short (the more years something has been broken or failing, the shorter that list becomes).

All that said, engineers sometimes ""simplify"" something that they believe is overly complex, but only because they don't understand the problem fully. This can lead to them, over time, piecemeal re-creating the design they replaced or, alternatively, building something worse.

For example, an engineer decides they can simplify a system by using ""a new, simple configuration schema"" only to find themselves writing their own LALR parser generator because their schema can't be parsed by YACC-generated parser.

This is a common starting point for the ""inner platform effect"", whereby a ""simplified"" abstraction ends up being as fully featured as the system it abstracts, but with new idiosyncrasies.",1649752688,programming,shines4k,programming,Comment,253

I‚Äôm saying functional programming languages are semantically equivalent, aside from their bespoke specializations around practical use cases. C is great for low-level CPU instructions, JS is great for targeting the document object model in your browser, C# is great for higher-level networking code, and OCaml is great for compiling languages.

Each of those languages excels not because of hardware being what it is, but more *generally* because each of them is an example of *specialization*. Each of them incorporates some practical outside concepts as first-class citizens of the language. And for C, that just happens to be low-level CPU interactions.

What I meant was that programmers care about the results of their computations, how simple it was to achieve those results, and how quickly they obtained those results.

My thing is, there isn‚Äôt anything special about *hardware* in that sense.

And in that case, JS is your friend, because (at least in the browser runtime) it has the DOM as a first-class citizen of the language. Any language can work with the DOM on some remote machine if you try hard enough, but JS is king of that domain.

And even when it comes to hardware, it‚Äôs fair to say that C has retained its semantic relevance, but that isn‚Äôt necessarily guaranteed. C was created before multi-core processing, and it could have been the case that C‚Äôs language semantics worked perfectly well for single-threaded systems, but had no way to express a multi-threaded control flow. It just so happens to work great(-ish), partially because CPU manufacturers happened to care a lot about how programmers would interface with their components.

GPU programming is also a thing. That‚Äôs one major blind spot for C when it comes to interfacing with hardware. It‚Äôs just not a great semantic fit for that specialized device.

Meanwhile the senior dev. of a different team had a habit of using magic numbers because he was too lazy to convert fixed sized arrays into dynamic lists or maps and any number chosen was just big enough to ""fix"" a crash for a month or two, which actually resulted in binaries that ran out of memory just reserving memory for static structures. For two other devs. I could assume that any bugfix had to be copy pasted to multiple other locations because fuck dry, fuck libraries, just getting things done (TM).

Linux uses a unified filesystem node cache. All of the files and directories, once loaded from their respective filesystems and until they are pushed out due to memory pressure, reside in the file cache.

The kernel does its own path traversal in that system, and it will go step by step through it since it's possible to mount files in multiple places, bind directories in multiple places or even in loops, traverse symlinks, start from various different directories if different roots have been set. And all of that can stretch across any number of mounted filesystems that point back and forth into each other with those mounts, links, etc.

Once it loads a name, the slash at the end would probably check that it is a directory, but it wouldn't actually traverse anywhere ( not sure with symlinks, you'd have to check ). For most cases, though, it wouldn't ask the filesystem for a new node. So if you return a file node, and then it hits the slash, it's just an error. If you return a directory node, and then it hits the slash, its just self-references.

Big companies are more inclined to teach leadership to create a framework for the company culture.  Smaller companies aren't so ridgit and sometimes people do what needs to be done, which can focus on less on team personal growth and more on individuals contributing.

Does the author think that people should read this article and then use linked lists in Python? If so, the author is mistaken.

On modern hardware, linked lists are almost never useful. In practice even doing thing like removing a single element out of the middle of a vector-like structure, like a Python list, is _still faster_ than removing it out of the middle of a linked list. The only way to win with the linked list is to have a pointer in hand to the exact element of interest to remove, and while that's possible, to work with linked lists _entirely_ in terms of such API is somewhat uncommon. As soon as you might traverse an unknown number of nodes of the linked list _even once_, you've lost on modern hardware.

Basically, there's never a reason to use linked lists anymore. Those who are the exceptional cases already know when this is not true and can handle themselves. Anyone else who is not certain, you should basically never use a linked list, because even when the algorithmic complexity seems favorable, the constant overhead is brutal murder on modern, real machines. The crossover point to when the linked list algorithmic complexity will finally outperform a vector-based representation is generally _larger than your entire RAM_.

2832,"The only thing NPM is guilty of is having a dependency resolution strategy^(1) that eliminated barriers to deep, convoluted dependency trees. JavaScript itself is a bigger contributor to the problem, in that (at the time NPM was released) it:

1. did not have proper classes, so most packages exported a small number (possibly only one) of functions
2. did not have a rich type system, so everything simply relied on duck typing objects

Together these meant that, since all you're doing is using functions that operate on a handful of common data types (array, object, number, string), there's no reason group related functionality modules - `foo()`, `bar()`, and `baz()` can all be in separate modules since they don't need to share type definitions or anything. The function `bar()` takes an object that behaves like a `foo` and doesn't care if it got it from the official foo module, or is actually a MongoDB connection manager monkey-patched to have foo-like properties.

2839,"They were mostly java games which decompiles to pretty readable code, now since it was obfuscated and minimised a lot of useful stuff like function and class names would be completely stripped but I don't recall ever having an issue where the decompiled code couldn't just immediately be recompiled back to produce the same output. Since Java decompiles pretty fantastically so what I was doing was, like I mentioned, a lot easier than what this guy is doing. 

Often this was a first step, at the time (early 2000s) the Japanese phones were far more capable than the European ones so often you had to spend a lot of time after you had it running trying to get it cut down to the point that you had something playable. A simple example of the thing you might do would be a lot of the Japanese phones supported reflection and rotation for sprites while many of the EU ones didn't so you would have to extract the sprite, create mirrored and rotated versions of it as needed and re-encode it onto the phone. You would then find that you had more sprites than the phones could handle so you start seeing which ones you can prune, which ones work fine, you would then run up against draw call limitations where you might only be able to render 20-30 sprites per frame so often stuff like background graphics would just have to be pruned. Finally you would end up doing localisation stuff to extract all the japanese text and do the usual EFIGS (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish) localisations.

The occasional times we worked on actual compiled games, like Brew games for example we would just go through the hassle of getting the source code. You could get it but it just ended up being a slow painful process of working your way through a lot of objections and even then you would just get a version of the game. We never once got access to something like source control for example, you would just get a single build and have to work from there.

2952,"Sort of. I would hesitate to be dogmatic about it, because software design depends a lot on the context and the goals you have.

Here‚Äôs what I (a random dude on the internet) think about it:

Hiding your data is almost never a good idea unless you have a brilliant abstraction over some complicated &amp; *very* well-defined procedure. I would boil it down to: ‚Äúpremature abstraction is the root of all evil.‚Äù

When you make an abstraction, sometimes all you‚Äôre doing is putting a veil over something that is inherently complex, and rather than making the procedure crystal clear to the next programmer, you hide it all underneath an abstraction that partially covers their use case, and they ultimately have to look inside your abstraction to figure out how it works, in addition to trying to solve their original problem.

So premature abstraction wastes time upfront with the design &amp; implementation of the abstraction, and it also wastes time down the road when others need to unwind your abstraction to get their work done.

The other big thing is this‚Ä¶ In general, if you can ***see*** the data flowing through the control graph, then you have a better chance at actually reasoning about the overall system you‚Äôre working with.

Some systems become so large that this is a lost cause anyway, and in that situation it‚Äôs important to not abstract away *everything*, but only the highest impact parts of the code.

But you have to be careful. Adding wrappers and layers and adapters and abstract interfaces and shared base classes‚Ä¶ all of that just multiplies the amount of code in the codebase, making the problem of ‚Äúfitting the program in your head‚Äù many times worse than it needs to be.

So yeah, I‚Äôm general, the way to do this is to stop thinking about ‚Äúobjects‚Äù and ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù that ‚Äúdo some job‚Äù in your program. Instead, you just figure out what your data *currently* looks like, then figure out what you *need* the data to look like, and which machines/components need that data in that format. And then your program basically writes itself. You just transform the data according to that schematic.

The biggest realization for me (at least in OOP languages) was that *very few things can be modeled as actual objects*. Most parts of your program are actually *processes*. So most of your classes should be *processes*.

To the extent that you write classes at all, you should be thinking about the class as having a specific *lifetime*. You instantiate the object, call its method to begin the process, update the internal state as necessary, and finally produce a result and discard the object. It‚Äôs not an employee doing some job‚Äîit‚Äôs an encapsulated procedure running on a computer.

Everything else should just be static methods or free functions, using function overloading for any polymorphism you think you need (and you probably don‚Äôt need it very much).",1649697733,programming,ScientificBeastMode,programming,Comment,487

This is harder to do when talking managerial roles. While you can give a software engineer things you would normally give a senior software engineer, it's awkward to have an IC manage a team without having them with a managerial title.

unicode had no choice.

In longer form, the reason unicode exists in the first place is to be one charset to rule them all. And that means it has to support everything more or less. People were already mucking with character sets to get emoji (remember DOS 8859-1 smileys?), so if unicode didn't include them then it wouldn't be the common character set because people would have used different incompatible ones.

1. ""VP of technology"" at a tiny startup for two years.  I was 30 and hired a team of 4.  I made a few mistakes, but we were all young and not having to please anyone above me was helpful. 
2. Team Lead at Microsoft for four years.  This was a huge jump - new role, new org, new product, new tech, and starting out managing eight people.   Things that helped:  studied like crazy ahead of time, not knowing the tech (because it forced me to trust my team).   Things that hurt:  not knowing how to manage up, not understanding what meetings are for in a large corporation.   I eventually quit to go back to being an IC.   I like leading a team, but the corporate part of managing stressed me out. 
3. Technical partner for another startup.  Formed a team of mostly of pretty sharp interns.  Again, things are better without someone above to please - feels much more like a team effort.   Biggest mistake was letting myself get talked into a platform change in the middle.  We still published a game, but it cost us a year.   
4. Team manager at Adobe (current).   I was a member of the team and was promoted.   This time I was blindsided by working with senior developers.  Totally different breed of person and I'm learning some hard lessons about how to manage.  

Overall thoughts:   

* People skills are critical.  This is really tough in the programming world because so many people are on the autistic spectrum (including myself).  I've made people skills a study for the past 30 years, so this has helped.

3146,"&gt; Thats why i said a javascript file (.js) :D (There is actually a difference).

OK, I somehow missed that, but that's still not an Hello World in Javascript because the browser is just displaying the source code as is, not interpreting it. You can't execute Javascript code like that, and if you use any other extension (that the browser does not specifically handle) it'd show the same thing.

&gt; My point still stands: Using one example to compare languages based on how long / fast it is to type is ridiculous

Agree, and specifically the Hello World example is terrible for that. Hello World is important for teaching a language, because it basically says ""this is the scaffold for a simple program. We will explain what it means later, but for now it's just something you have to write each time, and the actual code goes inside"".

Java really is on the verbose side of programming languages, but the reasons for that are only partially related to the reasons why it's Hello World is longer. Hello World gives an ""unfair advantage"" to scripting languages like Python and Javascript because you can write one without declaring a function but in real life programs you are going to want to declare functions anyway. Also `System.out.println` vs `print` is not that much a sign of verbosity because more complex programs will mostly write to files/streams/APIs, and you'd usually use a logging framework for logging, so having a shortcut for writing to stdout should not be a dealbreaker.

The only part of Java's verbosity that really gets hinted in the Hello World is having to write the class - and it's not even the main reason why Java is so verbose.",1649689170,programming,somebodddy,programming,Comment,288

3209,"&gt; What is your background I am curious to make such bold claims?

Mainly Computer Vision, Graphics/Datastructures and Machine Learning.

I've written a few console homebrews in my early programming years. I got fascinated by how the exploits on the PSP work (I learned about how they work and tried to exploit my own software to run arbritrary code etc). I have also looked a little into Mario64 rom ~~hacking~~ modding long long time ago when the dissasembly was just about to become a thing, but most people where happy to modify only the assets.

I rarely use C nowadays, but I have written software for the exomars rover where you have to deal with extremely slow hardware that makes your 20 year old phone feel like a quantum computer. I have also *some* OS kernel development experience (enough to implement some syscalls and virtual memory management, but not enough to write an actual OS).


&gt; It just seems like you think anyone is capable of this, but it's not the case and this person is a genius in his own ways.

I honestly think *anyone* can do this with enough time (/money) and most and foremost dedication.

The guy has spent so much time on Mario64 romhacking that he memorized stuff like game shark codes or important hex addresses.

Not calling him Einstein doesn't imply I would call him dumb either.

I just want to encourage non-geniuses to give it a try.

Kaze is smart and extremely passioned, but at the same time I feel like people from different background and experience could potentially do much more (if you don't restrict yourself to the N64 hardware).

Should enterprise code be written the same as mathematical modelling code? Everyone would say no but no one ever talks about what the difference would be.

Yup, I see this all the time. People shooting themselves in the foot by deliberately adding un-necessary complexity in order to conform to the latest pattern/framework doing the rounds in the industry.

Anecdote: I saw one case where a team was tasked with building a financial product application system, they decided to use kafka for the message bus, even though we had a perfectly functioning message bus (rabbitMQ), and architect what was fundamentally a request/response system using an event driven asynchronous architecture driven by kafka streams. When the project started they didn't even have any kafka infrastructure in UAT, so they couldn't deploy anything for 3 months whilst the infrastructure was being sorted. All this happened against a deadline, so unsurprisingly things got panicked, and rushed+hacked as soon as the infrastructure was ready.

The reason comes down to ‚Äúderivative works‚Äù and its definition.

Compiled code is protected as a derivative work because it is created from original source code. Likewise, decompiling it again produces another derivative, and in the SM64 case they were even able to recover the original code. So it is also protected by the  original‚Äôs copyright.

Lastly, that brings us to Kaze‚Äôs work. It is, again, a derivative work. Even though he contributed a lot of his own work, it was still derived from Nintendo‚Äôs code. It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúclean-room‚Äù project because he worked directly from Nintendo‚Äôs recovered source code.

3383,"Everyone here is missing the point. Most people had the JRE installed, and most people could successfully run Java Applets. That wasn't the problem.

The problem was that the founders of Java at SUN had this weird notion that Java must be *permanently* portable, and that it must never do anything to compromise that. 

In other words, Java is *always* compiled ""on the fly"" for your target CPU and platform, even including the entire SDK. You're not so much ""loading"" an applet as compiling it AND all of its libraries every time.

In the days of mechanical drives this caused enormous delays, up to a minute or more just to load a site with an applet. As you can imagine, this was very, *very* user unfriendly. The wait time was just not palatable.

SUN countered this by saying that the runtime ""caches"" things, but this only works in memory and only within the security sandbox. So if you keep reloading the *same* applet over and over, it's reasonably fast -- but nobody does this. If you occasionally navigate to some corporate page with a huge applet in it, it'll be slow every time -- this was the common scenario.

For comparison, Silverlight, Flash, and the .NET Runtime *all* precompile things to some degree. The standard library at a minimum is compiled for the target processor and loads very fast.

Google (not SUN!) developed a workaround for Android: they started the runtime + SDK, took a memory snapshot, and used that as the base for new app launches. So starting an app on an Android phone is more-or-less just ""fork"" and then loading some app code. This is nearly instant. 

Similarly, Microsoft .NET has the NGEN tool that precompiles installed apps so that they launch nearly instantly.

This extends to the server space as well. A typical ASP.NET enterprise web application launches in milliseconds to seconds. Maybe 10-30 seconds in the worst case for really heavyweight apps. Meanwhile I've seen web app startup times of **half an hour** for some frameworks, which is just absurd. Literally 100% CPU load on all cores while the JRE recompiles (from scratch! every time!) the entire stack of frameworks, middleware, and application. It's madness.

THIS is why Java failed on the desktop, and to some extent the server space as well. An idiotic philosophy that was aiming for a JRE where the CPU could be hot-swap replaced with a wildly different model *at runtime*, which obviously is something that would never happen. But *someone had a vision* of ""network computing"" where JRE apps could ""move between desktops and servers"" like packets.",1649669765,programming,BigHandLittleSlap,programming,Comment,436

A supply-chain attack refers to specific and deliberate threats like Depedency Confusion, not merely having a transitive dependency with a known vulnerability. 

The SolarWinds hack was a sophisticated state-sponsored hack that involved compromising the companies entire network and covertly injecting malicious code into their remote management software during the build process. Their remote management software was heavily used by governments and large companies to manage their IT resources, meaning they were able to push malware to thousands of companies.

Sublime Text 4 is what I would recommend to people if they don't mind with the nagging that they will receive as part of the evaluation version (the full version costs $99). It's fast and clean.

I haven't used Cuda Text for long, but it's faster than VS Code and looks like it's more powerful than Notepad++ or at least comparable. Worth a try.

Even though it's only done once, a long wait to download and install the JRE before being able to even start loading the web page content is a big hurdle for those looking for a quick game or small webapp.

Probably due to the above size, Flash Player was very quick to start up whereas the JVM was (and still is, really) a hog. Memory-wise Flash Player beats JVM again with Java well-reviled as a massive memory hog.

For the quality of animation/experience, Flash webpages were very small due to the use of vector graphics which cuts down sizes and results in much smoother rendering. I don't have experience with the Flash animation side of things but the tooling was supposed top notch with animation tweening and lots of built-in support for game and animation requirements. I'm guessing here but that would be things like sprite intersection, mouse and keyboard feedback, ray intersection.

From the capital E Enterprise side of things which I was in, Flash Player's enterprise framework Flex was second-to-none. Every sort of control you could imagine- date picker, combo, list, accordion, alignment primitives to nest containers and make controls stick to one side of the page or the other, dynamically resize as the page/container resized and with smooth performance. All styleable with standard CSS so a cross-site theming update could be done in a few lines.

Event handlers were written in ActionScript 3 which bears incredible resemblance to early TypeScript- optional strong typing, first-class support for XML (dates things a bit but super useful back when APIs returned XML not JSON), packages, classes, for-each, all things completely lacking from JavaScript at the time and Java didn't have them all- e.g. for-each loops came in Java 5 which was 2004.

Flash/Flex supported async HTTP calls and had its own densely-packed binary messaging format called Action Message Format. If the server end supported it you could cut down network usage by ~80%. Very similar to gRPC or Protocol Buffers these days although used client-server not just within server-side networks. It also supported bidirectional real-time communications with BlazeDS so something like a chat application could be written with instant message delivery rather than polling the server constantly for updates, which would always be late.

Flash/Flex supported a small amount of local storage for saving settings or small save game files/entries.

So to summarise Flash compared to Java Applets at the time, Flash was

- Faster to download
- Faster to start-up plugin
- Smaller page size == faster to load pages
- Better animation tooling
- Better standard UI widget library

And on the Flex/Enterprise side we had access to features that Java mainly didn't have and JavaScript would take decades to include:

- Async communication AKA AJAX
- Bidirectional communication AKA WebSockets
- Fully fleshed out flexible language AKA EcmaScript 6
- Small local storage AKA LocalStorage API
- Compressed binary messaging protocol AKA gRPC

Imagine having all of those features at a time when Java Applets took a minute to even start up and JavaScript was tripping over it's own shoes to the point where trying to implement simple things like AJAX in a cross-browser cross-OS fashion was an incredible struggle. It was like alien technology.",1649648288,programming,BinaryRockStar,programming,Comment,651

3580,"The most glaring omission is the ability to easily and accurately synchronize audio and graphics. In Flash you could import a track of audio and put frames of animation exactly where you want them to happen. You could be sure that it would always be exactly in sync, even if it had to drop frames to make that happen.

In JavaScript, you have to throw a lot of code at the problem to even come close to approximating this, and it's still not good enough to maintain lip sync for cartoon animations.",1649647988,programming,spacechimp,programming,Comment,92

The underlying concept is that a class is a *process*, not a *thing*. It has a lifetime, and a set of states that change over that lifetime before it is discarded.

If you do things this way, you kinda get half the benefits of immutability while still retaining the power and performance characteristics of interior mutable state. The fact that you deliberately discard it means you‚Äôre less likely to run into weird, unexpected states over the course of a long-running process, which is the main benefit of immutability. And then only a handful of objects actually last the full duration of the program.

So, if you follow an arbitrary rule to only define one method on a class, you‚Äôre more likely to write your code in this way.

You are spot on though about the cause of bad software being incompetent management and business driven engineering. Good Professional unions address this by ensuring that practitioners of a profession only ever report to others licensed in that profession.

So there was little incentive for anyone to come up with a killer Java applet.  Looking back, that was arguably the responsibility of Sun's marketers, but Sun was busy selling racks full of servers to soon-to-be-failing dot coms.",1649636366,programming,emotionalfescue,programming,Comment,102

Nobody cared about software engineering and it could be the wild west because (mostly) nobody died as a result of bad code. That software which did control man-rated equipment usually undergoes much more strict controls for liability reasons.

Ask an average homeowner if they want their handyman to build a nice looking deck, they'll say yes, that's the deck we want. They don't have the knowledge to know about bearing load, and they have huge party, and the deck becomes overloaded and lots of people die. It happens more often than you think. 

Generally some old stuff is safe to build over. It won't harm the end result. 

Some stuff is harmful to the end result, but it isn't catastrophic. Like bowed walls, they can be overcome with the right techniques such as floating a wall, or removing the old stuff and starting from a fresh plumb and level starting point.

Some stuff is downright catastrophic, but it takes time to accumulate. Think of a leaky shower pan that slowly drips water through the membrane and into the floor beneath it. It may be weeks/months/years before you have an issue, but when you do, it'll be super expensive to replace, because the damage is so severe and complicated. Or something like polybuteline plumbing, which may never cause an issue, but might just spring a catastrophic water leak unless it's ripped out and replaced. How expensive that gets depends on a lot of factors. 

Some stuff is immediately catastrophic, like a gas leak in the presence of a spark.

As engineers, we have a hard time classifying technical debt into these categories and managing risk due to the nascent nature of our profession.

Honestly, since I recently became a homeowner and have been researching construction techniques, I see the need for a universal ""building code"" for software. it's also made explaining certain types of technical debt easier to people who can understand things like leaky faucets and unlocked doors.",1649634467,programming,engineered_academic,programming,Comment,339

3672,"I dont think this is the issue. There are very similar issues even in construction (clients pushing for short termism, contractors being more than happy to oblige and collect the money and run).

The issue isnt a skills issue. Almost anyone who can produce bad code that works is capable of producing good code that works. You can certify people but the second they hit the real world and clients being unreasonable and not knowing what they really want all the skills in the world wont make a difference.

I think the real issue is that middle managers need to understand coding a bit better. Not necessarily to be coders themselves but to at least understand some core concepts, tradeoffs and principles.

Any large scale construction project is managed in conjunction with architects who as part of their training must be educated somewhat in building and construction. Problem in our world is these managers running billion dollar code projects can just come with no idea about programming.

Even technical platform managers often have no idea about the intricate details of the platform they manage. These guys can definitely code but see their management role as being hands off and high level. Basically the whole stack needs to move up one level and i think the root cause of the failure to do so is the money guys not respecting programming enough.

Current:
Dev - knows their shit

Senior dev - either really knows their shit or starting to become hands off

Platform lead - high level, is a coder but doesnt like being in the trenches so he can be seen as management material

Project lead - non technical, no idea about coding, doesnt really do anything

Business lead - no idea about coding but understands how to make money in the industry

That varies from school to school, but the goal is the same. It is not about preparing people for the workforce, directly. The consequence is that the people who come out of well designed programs tend to be better prepared for the workforce. Particularly at learning and adapting. 

Undergrad is just foundational. Naturally, little was ""programming"" (not much of work is ""programming"" either). I did take many courses where we needed to use programming to do our coursework. Towards the latter years it was almost 100% of my courses required programming to do the work. 

But that's not relevant, because all the code I wrote in undergrad was shit, and virtually every student whose code I've reviewed since then has been shit.

What's hard is the foundational knowledge to understand software engineering practices, and the ability for me to hand a paper or textbook to a colleague and expect them to understand it (and vice versa).

One thing I see going differently is niches. Some companies will actually use your code for 20 or 30 years. As opposed to ""tech"" companies who can and will change codebase when they scale past a certain point anyway. Then the question is is the programmer internal to the company, do they come every year, do you have a or several departments which can code?

How do we do a leadership change in companies so they know about this. Can we list cases where the companies lost millions of dollars in non edge cases spread over several of them?

Not only that the new generation of programmers need to know this aswell and start practicing it.

The biggest companies have the talent who know this and often have the financial incentive to fix it. But the companies as you have pointed out are not there yet.

I never want to work with this person ever.

This is such utter BS. It absolutely does matter, and the time it takes to write quality code is not that much longer than it takes to write bad code. You just need to hire well.

You can transform organizations though converting legacy code to higher quality microservices.

The problem with this line of thinking is the false assumption that no matter how bad things get, there will still be people willing and qualified to step into the role.

Legacy systems are like a superfund site. They are caused by carelessness want take a lot of money to clean up. And they prevent new profitable businesses fron springing up in their place.

My current job pays extremely well. It is laid back. We cannot keep developers for more than 6 months due to our legacy codebase. We are at a loss for a solution.

My current job has a big deal with a client. The request is time sensitive. The code quality is so bad we cannot even add simple features without weeks of development.

We lose our on money EVERY DAY because someone down the line said ""code quality doesn't matter"". It does. It is the difference between adapting to a changing environment and stagnating until someone eats your lunch.",1649616152,programming,h0nkycat420,programming,Comment,225
3810,"""Legacy code is the code that makes money""

This is actually true if you give it a thought - only code that makes money makes it long enough to become legacy, other code is discarded. I always tell that to new hires - learn to work with legacy code, embrace it. It's probably the best code as it stroke the best balance between long-term maintainability and time-to-market and do-the-useful-stuff.

Yes it's sometimes tedious to work with it but it is REALLY precious and valuable knowledge to come to a team maintaining legacy code and fix it.

Also it's arguable *the easiest*. You inherited ""crap"", you can only make it better or fail trying. No one will blame you for leaving crap after 2 years if you got crap in the first place.

Frankly I love working with legacy code, $$$ is great, job security even greater, cash flows are steady, no one questions the need for the software existence, if you make it better (which I usually do) you're praised as a hero if not - then who cares, you move on to the next project.",1649615954,programming,scodagama1,programming,Comment,186

3815,"+1 to a bunch of this. Amy's team is probably the original developer or longstanding owner of this legacy code.  Of course they own it, they wrote the last major enhancement one year ago and have owned the code area for five.  It fits with the rest of their responsibilities and code ownership, and the ""legacy"" accrues over time if you aren't deleting code as fast as you write it -- no one does.

Everyone owns more code than is actively worked on at one time but may get called up at any time with requests from other teams.  Ideally these dependencies and feature gaps are recognized early so Amy's team can consult well before it's a blocking dependency and schedule appropriately but realizing late happens all of the time.  That too should be factored into Amy's team schedule but Joe's late-breaking blocking issue doesn't automatically become Amy's top priority.  A month is a short amount of time in the grand scheme, especially if the request needs non-trivial investment from Amy's team.

Maybe an experienced engineer from Joe's team takes a swing at authoring a change that can satisfy their requirements.  It's investigated well and reasonably authored, but doesn't robustly solve the problem or doesn't consider all relevant aspects.  Amy's reviewing engineer will own this code once submitted, not Joe's engineer.  They shouldn't take a PR they wouldn't submit themselves just because it unblocks Joe.  I was in this situation late last year and after more back and forth, reviewing the source feature's requirements and range of scenarios, there were other factors that hadn't been incorporated into the design and the design was changed appropriately instead of taking a code change.  This non-change took more than a week's worth of my time over a month, all well-intended but ultimately resulting in no new code in our component.  

Could it have been resolved before getting to me? Sure. Could it have been resolved by design before it got to Joe's engineer? Sure. It just didn't work out that way.  The design was ported from another platform and hadn't considered the resulting variations of how it would interact with a component that didn't exist on the first platform.  Joe's engineer doesn't own or think about that component so it slid through until it got to us (who happen to own it since it's a shared component).

I mean having maintainable code becomes increasingly important when you have turnover, since you need to be able to onboard developers quickly to be able to start working on it. Putting in place standards and enforcing them is something the lead should be doing.

&gt; Most simply inherit already poorly written code. Providing tests and fixing all the legacy code will take tremendous amount of time which will impact the velocity of feature development.

You know what also impacts velocity? Developers constantly having to put out fires in production and not being able to deliver any new features because they're either constantly bugfixing or working around the limitations of the code.

I understand that you can't just stop everything and go on a refactoring spree for 5 years, but this is something that the business needs to figure out. What you're talking about works for very short term growth, but you can't build a sustainable business without caring about code quality.

3831,"I've been around the industry long enough to have worked on a good mix of failed/successful projects at different companies.

My anecdotal experience has been that when a project flopped that was staffed with well meaning devs and the problems were development related, it was most often because the devs got lost in the engineering.  Specifically over-engineering and being too clever, especially early in a project's lifecycle before the problem space has a had chance to fully reveal itself.

At the most extreme end, I have seen months wasted up-front ""getting the architecture right"" or building a framework before a single line of feature code is written. At the less extreme end, over-abstraction and rigid application of principles in a misguided attempt to adhere to clean code rules and checkboxes. The people involved are trying their best but have gotten sucked into the idea that code must be written a certain way or its wrong.

The successes (when in the dev team's power) were mostly characterized by keeping things as simple as possible, especially at the start. Many people hear simple and conflate it with unstructured spaghetti and 5000 line files, which is not true, that is also a problem.

3839,"It's not so much that Amy's team won't facilitate changes in the legacy code, it's that the responsibility has been tacked onto her team. They're probably the longest-serving and most experienced engineers, which is why only they can review the changes properly.

But because they're the most valuable engineers, the team has been assigned to the most important feature development in other areas. Ownership of the legacy application is not officially their role, but by default nobody else in the company is capable of owning it, so they do. But only by default.

Which is why Amy's team have not assigned any time to reviewing changes to the legacy code base this quarter. Because that's not their real job.

This is a really common problem in all sorts of areas. A process or system which is considered low-maintenance or otherwise very stable, ends up becoming ownerless through staff churn or promotions or whatever.

Eventually an issue crops up, someone offers to help - in the interests of keeping things moving - and does so. Every now and again a few queries trickle in, but this person takes them and handles them. From their point of view, they don't own the system. They assign no time to it. They're just helping out. From everyone else's PoV they do own it. So when it comes time to make changes or the system requires a lot more maintenance for whatever reason, the non-owner becomes a bottleneck. They're still taking the tickets on the system but deprioritising them because they have ""real work"" to do.

It's important that every system has an owner. No matter how niche or rarely touched on, someone has to be in charge of it.

In this case, nobody should be going to Amy asking for changes to her system to be reviewed. The change to the system should have been part of her team's goals for this period, and they make and manage the change. If Amy's team don't want to work on that system or management don't want their most expensive engineers on it, then ownership should be handed to someone else and Amy's team cut out of the loop. The new team will eventually learn how it works, and release changes to prod without fucking everything.

They expect a strong frame and good craftsmanship as a given. The thing is that as a customer of this craft or professional discipline, I do not have the expertise myself to perform the work. If a marketplace for professional services is to be fair and efficient, then I either have to be an expert myself to determine exactly what I want and what services I should expect, or I should be able to trust a third party to vouch for the professionals qualifications.

You'll use different functions of these components throughout your application. 

Some of these components you wrote yourself for use in more than one area of the application.  

Many of these components already exist in the world so you use those that others have written, maybe even open source.

For example if you needed an interface to a SQL database.  Many versions of that already exist and can be easily imported from a repository of existing artifacts/libraries/packages. 

Maybe every time you build your application you pull those packages from their original repository.   Maybe you collect and manage your own set of packages in your own cloud based repository.  

When the *version number* of one of those packages is discovered to have a vulnerability, it is reported to many databases of known vulnerabilities.  For instance MITRE tracks and numbers them.

They get severity scores called CVSS.  They get common vulnerability exposure numbers called CVEs.

If you have or are using one of those packages in the places you are referencing them from at build time ... they exist in your supply chain and are fed into the finished product.

Think of it as an assembly line building a car. The storage bin where you have stored all the brake pads has all cracked brake pads in it.

The friend I mentioned is also pretty happy with his install, apparently KDE is a lot more flexible than the Windows shell.

However if we refuse to acknowledge that there are problems, we can't fix them.

I've shared the series done by LinusTechTips where they actually render their system unbootable by doing some really basic things like installing Steam. It's one of the highest profile and most extensive looks into Linux as a desktop OS, and they actually demonstrate how difficult it is to get an actual Linux system working and on par with what they have on Windows.

The friend I mentioned is quite capable technically and even then it caused him loads of headaches. It took him a couple of months of from-scratch installations, but he managed to do it and it became his OS of choice due to the flexibility of KDE.

However let's not kid ourselves and say that it's just familiarity or inertia, there are legitimate usability issues with the Linux desktop that really need to be fixed.

And for every person that's aware of it, there are at 10 that aren't aware of it so it kind of needs to be hammered into people that this a huge vulnerability in the language. For a badly written app (and let's be honest, most node servers are not produced to a high standard) there's the potential to escape the node process and gain full access to a server. It's a really fundamental issue with JS that's made worse by node's lack of security controls. That's made worse by JS committing to maintaining backwards compatibility, and really the only fix I can see is a new `""use strict;""` that removes some of the dynamism from JS.

3982,"It's not so much that Amy's team won't facilitate changes in the legacy code, it's that the responsibility has been tacked onto her team. They're probably the longest-serving and most experienced engineers, which is why only they can review the changes properly. 

But because they're the most valuable engineers, the team has been assigned to the most important feature development in other areas. Ownership of the legacy application is not officially their role, but by default nobody else in the company is capable of owning it, so they do. But only by default.

Which is why Amy's team have not assigned any time to reviewing changes to the legacy code base this quarter. Because that's not their real job. 

This is a really common problem in all sorts of areas. A process or system which is considered low-maintenance or otherwise very stable, ends up becoming ownerless through staff churn or promotions or whatever. 

Eventually an issue crops up, someone offers to help - in the interests of keeping things moving - and does so. Every now and again a few queries trickle in, but this person takes them and handles them. From their point of view, they don't own the system. They assign no time to it. They're just helping out. From everyone else's PoV they do own it. So when it comes time to make changes or the system requires a lot more maintenance for whatever reason, the non-owner becomes a bottleneck. They're still taking the tickets on the system but deprioritising them because they have ""real work"" to do. 

It's important that every system has an owner. No matter how niche or rarely touched on, someone has to be in charge of it. 

In this case, nobody should be going to Amy asking for changes to her system to be reviewed. The change to the system should have been part of her team's goals for this period, and they make and manage the change. 
If Amy's team don't want to work on that system or management don't want their most expensive engineers on it, then ownership should be handed to someone else and Amy's team cut out of the loop. 
The new team will eventually learn how it works, and release changes to prod without fucking everything. That's what you have non-prod environments and testing for.",1649601398,programming,seamustheseagull,programming,Comment,388

What you have to worry about is code that requires huge operational overheads to keep it running. For example, at my old job the legacy code was so bad that we had a team of people who would edit the projection database whenever it messed up, because that was easier than fixing the deficiencies in the short term.

[Seed7](http://seed7.sourceforge.net) can do this also. Libraries like [bytedata.s7i](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/bytedata.htm) and [bitdata.s7i](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/bitdata.htm) allow accessing data at the byte and bit level. But Seed7 has not been designed to do UNPORTABLE systems programming.

&gt;It is even possible to write such code that can be portable across different targets as well.

This is not special to Ada. In many languages it is possible to write portable code. Unfortunately most programmers don't care and this results in unportable programs. Seed7 takes [portability](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/faq.htm#portable) more serious. In Seed7 it is hard to write unportable code (see the [design principles of Seed7](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/faq.htm#design_principles) for details).

Seed7 can also work with different layouts of a data structure. The [cpio.s7i](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/cpio.htm) library is such an example. CPIO headers can be ascii or binary. And a binary CPIO header can be big-endian or little-endian. The [cpio.s7i](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/cpio.htm) library works with all these header variants.

The [tiff.s7i](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/tiff.htm) library is another example. A TIFF file can be big-endian or little-endian. The [tiff.s7i](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/tiff.htm) library has no problem in supporting both encodings.",1649592532,programming,ThomasMertes,programming,Comment,195

It doesn't, if we're talking about C# or Java. The client code only cares about the methods it actually uses.

Go look at the origin of ISP. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle#Origin

Note how they are talking about ""redeployment cycle of an hour"". What does that mean?

I'll tell you. The article is talking about C++ compiler times. The ""interface"" in question isn't a C#/Java `interface`, it's a C++ header file. (Every wonder where the term API came from?)

The idea behind ISP was that if you break up the single large header file into smaller ones, each client could reference only the header it needs. This reduces the chance that any particular client, i.e. class, would need to be recompiled. It only cares about the header file with the subset of methods it is using.

C# and Java compilers don't work that way. So ISP, as originally defined, is irrelevant.

It's this absurd combination of a dev team that actively despised their most active users, amateurish software development mistakes, ridiculous financial problems and heavy-handed solutions, privacy violations by multiple parties simultaneously, lack of transparency, a public who didn't even understand what it was (is it a video game? A fancy word processor with a text prediction tool? A personalized erotica generation app?), I could go on.  Some fun facts:

 * AI dungeon was hacked at one point (that's a whole other story).  They discovered at that at least half of AI dungeon stories were NSFW.

 * Before AI dungeon dropped OpenAI, they were also strong-armed by OpenAI into filtering out certain kinds of NSFW stuff (e.g. noncon, underage, bestiality).  The filter they made was so non-functional that it not only stopped the generation of all numbers between 5 and 18, dogs, cats, horses, and watermelons, but it actually made the offending content even more common in outputs, even in non-NSFW stories.  One explanation I heard was that the AI would use euphemistic language to get around the filter (even for SFW content), and that would beget more euphemisms, until the AI was convinced of the subtext that you were in love with your horse all along.

 * Less than a month after the filters were put in place, users from 4chan (who used AI dungeon primarily for erotica, and were a huge part of the core AI dungeon community) stood up a functional replacement called ""NovelAI"" with tons the features they had been begging the AI dungeon devs to implement from the very beginning, open-source models from EleutherAI instead of OpenAI, and a focus on privacy.

4135,"&gt; SP: This is a fun one. Originally it was a trick to reduce recompiles in C++. The ""interface"" was header files. By breaking up one massive header into four smaller ones, you reduce the chance that the header you care about is the one that's changed. Useful yes, if you are already in the position of having a ""god object"" that you can't break up. But certainly not a situation that a Java or C# programmer will ever be in because they don't have header files. So instead it has transformed into something vague about interfaces existing.

Dude, really. You know nothing.

""This principle deals with the disadvantages of ‚Äúfat‚Äù interfaces. Classes that have ‚Äúfat‚Äù interfaces are classes whose
interfaces are not cohesive. In other words, the interfaces of the class can be broken up into groups of methods.
Each group serves a different set of clients. Thus, some clients use one group of member functions, and other cli-
ents use the other groups.""

4137,"&gt; But no one explains what it's supposed to mean. How do we know what a ""responsibility"" is? A feature that's a ""single responsibility"" in my mind might very well be composed of 10 responsibilities in someone else's mind.

""What Is a Responsibility?
In the context of the SRP, we define a responsibility to be ‚Äúa reason for change.‚Äù If you can think of more than one
motive for changing a class, then that class has more than one responsibility. This is sometimes hard to see. We are
accustomed to thinking of responsibility in groups. For example, consider the Modem interface in Listing 8-1. Most
of us will agree that this interface looks perfectly reasonable. The four functions it declares are certainly functions
belonging to a modem.
    
    Listing 8-1
    Modem.java -- SRP Violation
    interface Modem
    {
    public void dial(String pno);
    public void hangup();
    public void send(char c);
    public char recv();
    }

However, there are two responsibilities being shown here. The first responsibility is connection manage-
ment. The second is data communication. The dial and hangup functions manage the connection of the modem,
while the send and recv functions communicate data.
Should these two responsibilities be separated? That depends on how the application is changing. If the
application changes in ways that affect the signature of the connection functions, then the design will smell of
Rigidity because the classes that call send and recv will have to be recompiled and redeployed more often than we
like. In that case the two responsibilities should be separated as shown in Figure 8-3. This keeps the client applica-
tions from coupling the two responsibilities.

If, on the other hand, the application is not changing in ways that cause the the two responsibilities to change
at different times, then there is no need to separate them. Indeed, separating them would smell of Needless
Complexity .
There is a corollary here. An axis of change is an axis of change only if the changes actually occur. It is not
wise to apply the SRP, or any other principle for that matter, if there is no symptom.""

4139,"&gt; One of the things that infuriates me so much about SOLID is people like you falsely attributing anything good to SOLID.

&gt; You can't show any good code that is actually written with SOLID in mind. But that's ok in your mind because you just claim the work of people who don't believe in it.

Go ahead, show me that it does not work. Show me good code that does NOT follow SOLID. We can go letter by letter, come on. :)

Frankly, I don't expect much from someone who doesn't discern between 'faith' and 'values represented by faith'. :)

&gt; To everyone else in the world, a principle is a ""a fundamental truth or proposition"". It is stricter and more widely applicable than a mere rule. 

And for engineers it means ""a general scientific theorem or law that has numerous special applications across a wide field."" I can throw around dictionary too, see? But act of writing in itself is not an engineering feat, neither it follows fundamental truths.

Tell me, have you actually read Agile Software Development? Do you realize, that there are PAGES written for each principle; do you realize, that they in broad terms a re-naming of something that was proven time and time again? You are arguing a NAME, you do realize that? If it was ""Five heuristics that form a good acronym that either predict good code"" instead of SOLID principles would it be acceptable for you?

You can argue that Martin is not a good person, fine with me. You can argue that SOLID principles could be worded in a better way. You can argue that they are not well defined (At least if you actually haven't read the source, but I'm not fooling myself). Neither one of his works are perfect. But all of them, in broad terms, survived both the scrutiny and the test of time.

SOLID comes from 2002 if I remember correctly. You surely CAN provide me with an alternative, who teaches these things in a better way and has at least similar traction in programming? I have a better idea - put your money where your mouth is - write a book! You sure do seem to write a lot for reddit. Then you can show me research &amp; your sources (As Martin do) and we'll see how good of a programmer you are.

Boot camps are a 3‚Äì6 month affair. People start. They learn hyper-relevant programming concepts and frameworks. They graduate. This supplies the industry with juniors who have tooling and pipeline knowledge while usually lacking some CS depth. 

University undergrads are usually coming from a 2-4 year program. Most of them are CS (of course dependent on locality), so the courses are theory-based. Students are still be taught that every function needs a comment to document it - including bog standard accessors/getters/setters. But the difference is that all of those years allow for a breadth of exploration that gives students more tools. Sometimes those tools are shallow bits of knowledge, but just having the awareness can go a long way. 

I‚Äôm a CS grad. I spent a few weeks with Scala, because I kept hearing about how great functional programming is. I took a course on security and cryptography. I have yet to write any crypto for a company, but certain usage patterns with authorization, their libraries, and how data/tokens are handled have helped me identify bad security practices. Regex engines are really just automata generators* with extra features. I worked on a project that used Spring Webflow. Instead of a rest controller with endpoints, forms would POST to this framework. It was XML docs that mapped out the application from state to state. There was a set of states that need to be refactored, but they could end up looping if not careful. I recognized that I could treat it like a grammar to put it into Chomsky normal form to ensure that it always ended in a terminal state.

4213,"&gt; I keep seeing criticisms of SOLID, without specifically stating what they are criticizing,

That's part of the scam.

The reason SOLID 'works' is because nobody believes in SOLID, but instead use it as an excuse to do whatever they want.

Consider the principles in use versus their origin.

SRP: People say ""you have to know when to apply it"". Which basically means it has been reduced to ""A class should only have one reason to change unless you think it should have more than one reason to change"". That's not useful advice.

OCP: If you read the original literature on OCP, it was a specific way to prevent breaking changes by making all classes inheritable, and never adding methods to an already published class. Nobody believes this any more. But rather than abandon OCP, people instead pretend it means ""Do whatever you want so long as you can call it extensible"". Again, not real advice.

LSP: This is the only real principle in SOLID, and it's a very good one that should be followed 100% of the time. But since the overall rule of SOLID is, ""You need to know when to apply it"", LSP ceases to mean anything. ""A subclass must always obey the contract of its parent class unless it doesn't"" isn't advice.

ISP: This is a fun one. Originally it was a trick to reduce recompiles in C++. The ""interface"" was header files. By breaking up one massive header into four smaller ones, you reduce the chance that the header you care about is the one that's changed. Useful yes, if you are already in the position of having a ""god object"" that you can't break up. But certainly not a situation that a Java or C# programmer will ever be in because they don't have header files. So instead it has transformed into something vague about interfaces existing.

DI: There's two terms with this abbreviation. And two definitions for it. Dependency inversion, which is when you change the dependency chain from A -&gt; B to B -&gt; A. And dependency injection, where you basically acknowledge that constructors exist and you can pass an interface to that constructor. But no real guidance on when you should use either DI. So again, the developer is left to do whatever they want.

In conclusion, SOLID only continues to exist because people ignore the meaning of SOLID and use it as a generic justification for any design. If they were forced to use a strict interpretation, they would quickly abandon it.",1649562074,programming,grauenwolf,programming,Comment,422
4214,"&gt; SOLID stands already addresses this, with the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

In what way?

SRP says nothing about abstractions. Absolutely nothing at all.

ISP, if you ignore the original definition, deals with abstract interfaces at least. But an abstract interface is not an abstraction. It gives you the same API as the underlying class, or at best a subset of it.

An actual abstraction simplifies things. For example, replacing a bunch of file-handle code with the `File.ReadAllLines(path)` function.

4238,"Regarding future-proofing I kinda mean both things.

I find that most developers are extremely bad at predicting the future. They spend a lot of time building abstractions and layers on top of more abstractions and layers, trying to account for every edge case‚Ä¶ And then we end up spending *even more* time undoing those abstractions because we needed to do things very differently than expected, or one of the foundational layers wasn‚Äôt doing everything we needed it to do, and we had to move heaven and earth to make the necessary changes.

I‚Äôve seen some codebases with like 200 class types/interfaces that all fit together somehow to essentially fetch data from a database, do a few calculations, and send it to the client. That could literally be 1-3 classes, max.

So many developers are terrified of the idea that they might need to modify an existing piece of code. But the real cost of doing that is only magnified when you have tons of layers to wade through, because each time you inevitably change something closer to the ‚Äúbase class‚Äù or whatever, those changes cascade outward through the system, and it‚Äôs pure hubris to think you can totally avoid doing that.

Therefore, when you keep things as minimalistic as possible, the modifications might seem painful, but you can at least keep most of the moving parts in your head all at once, and you get through it. And that‚Äôs way better than the horrible 1-month refactor that you would have to do with all the abstraction layers piled on top.

One thing to consider is that ‚Äúabstraction‚Äù is often equivalent to ‚Äúdeliberate tight coupling.‚Äù Sometimes tight coupling is what you want. You sometimes want 5 components to share a common abstract behavior because they are logically connected, but that‚Äôs actually pretty rare.

4296,"&gt;A ""responsibility"" is related to the reasons to change. For example, a common example is a report. The presentation aspects of a report are one set of reasons a report can change and the calculations are another set of reasons. It is common wisdom to separate the presentation aspects from the calculation aspects, because you don't want changes to the presentation to effect the calculations, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep code that changes together together. Keep code that changes separately separate.

&amp;#x200B;

Often times reports require both new data and new layout. SRP would be entirely satisfied by solution that keeps them together as methods in the same class. We would need extra requirements to move them to separate classes.

Its not all that controversial. React and other component based UI frameworks showed how bringing together CSS + HTML + JS + local state results in better developer experience.

First paragraph of my replay is NOT my invention. Found it on the web. Robert Martin when describing SRP is also using equivalent description.

This version is superior because it explicitly names change and thus focuses developer on time dimension.

I think is important for people to truly understand what this means, and why principles are not the problem, and why demonizing principles is misguided.

During WW2, during the island hopping campaign in the Pacific Theater in with the war with Japan, American forces built forward operating bases on these islands, landing supplies in cargo planes. For this operation not to be a complete disaster, obviously you need air traffic control and ground crews, who perform very specific tasks to ensure that the planes land safely.

When the war was over, these bases were abandoned. But some natives who didn't understand why air traffic control and the ground crews performed their ""rituals"", thought that if they did they rituals, the cargo planes would come back with the supplies. The natives recreated the artifacts of air traffic control and ground crews to perform the rituals, but alas the cargo planes did not return.

Principles like SOLID are like air traffic control and ground crews who operate within a larger organization, they provide guidelines to help improve software quality and maintainability. But, if the principles are mindlessly applied, software quality and maintainability are as likely to come as that cargo plane.",1649544366,programming,_shorug0ru_,programming,Comment,202
4322,"I partly agree with you and partly agree with other commenters -- my comment was to point that there is a fundamental difference between credit scores and difficult to validate algorithms for hiring -- it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.

I agree that discrimination has happened in the past with banks.  My point is that there is at least a financial incentive to address that discrimination and it's easier to detect.

With hiring using AI/ML as a scoring mechanism, there's little to no incentive to correct discrimination in the algorithms as it's harder detect the discrimination due to the size of the parameter space and harder to tie that discrimination to the bottom line of companies.  Also, using a subtly biased algorithm gives an element of plausible deniability for organizations that do want to discriminate.

I agree, in theory AI/ML \*could\* make hiring more fair.   However, AI/ML can also make the system less fair while also providing plausible deniability.

 think the disagreement in the larger discussion comes from whether it's even possible to fully validate that these systems are fair.

Personally, I feel the current situation is wrong.  I would be OK with using these systems if/when we can fully validate them but not before.

4330,"&gt; Like if you stop trying to package everything into an opaque box that meets all the unknown potential future needs of the system, then you end up writing code that is way simpler to reason about, and it happens to execute way faster.

Those ""opaque boxes"" are abstractions, and can never meet all potential future needs of any system, which is why no system is designed that way. That's literally what the I in SOLID stands for, Interface Segregation Principle and probably S too, Single Responsibility Principle.

To put it another way, how much do you care about the implementation of the device drivers that you use? Or the implementation details of the probably hundreds of libraries that are used in modern programs.

&gt; This habit of ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù and what essentially boils down to ‚Äútrying to eliminate the entire concept of implementation details‚Äù is basically the footgun of the entire software industry.

No, that's not it at all. ""Future proofing"" involves two concepts. 

First, instead of building a giant system that does everything, build a bunch of smaller systems that do very specific things and combine the parts using interfaces such that the components of the system interoperate in predictable ways. That way, the system becomes ""future proof"" because you have to replace parts of the system instead of rewriting the system from sractch.

Second, and most importantly, divide the system into parts that change for similar reasons, which requires a higher level understanding of the requirements to understand what can change and how. Unless you know absolutely nothing about the domain that your program operates in, there are very few ways that changing requirements can surprise you. 

One of the most important changes I did to improve the software quality in this one system I was talking to the business analyst to get an understanding how the business works. It turns out, shockingly, that none of the previous developers of this system actually bothered to understand the business and added features based on what made technical sense instead of business sense. This meant that we were constantly getting surprised by new requirements, and the code became a Christmas tree of special cases. I reorganized the code based on what I learned, creating data structures and functions modeling the business (using SOLID principles) and the code became much simpler and much more ""future proof"", because new requirements fit more neatly into well-thought out abstractions.",1649543111,programming,_shorug0ru_,programming,Comment,405

While there are those kind of people, there are the kind of people who question ""dogma"" because they don't understand what they are questioning.

For example, when you say that terms like ""responsibility"" and ""module"" are not ""well defined"", are you reacting to what the author of the post is saying and the author didn't well define it? What have you read on the subject that would lead you to believe that these terms are not well defined?

I noticed that instead of asking for more authoritative sources, you just dismiss the terms out of hand.

For example, I can tell you that ""responsibility"" is a synonym for [cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_\(computer_science\)) (which also applies to modules). It's just a catchier way to say the same thing. I first read about this in Grady Booch's book [Object Oriented Design with Applications](https://www.amazon.com/oriented-applications-Benjamin-Cummings-engineering/dp/0805300910/ref=sr_1_3?qid=1649537225&amp;refinements=p_27%3AGrady+Booch&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3) written in 1991!

&gt; The problem stems from the fact that there's not enough rigid definitions to go by to judge the application of those principles.

4507,"&gt; How do we know what a ""responsibility"" is? 

A ""responsibility"" is related to the reasons to change. For example, a common example is a report. The presentation aspects of a report are one set of reasons a report can change and the calculations are another set of reasons. It is common wisdom to separate the presentation aspects from the calculation aspects, because you don't want changes to the presentation to effect the calculations. 

What you would ideally like to do is create two boundaries, one boundary isolates the presentation aspects, and another boundary isolates the calculation aspects. The process of creating these boundaries is called defining a ""responsiblity"". And the ""single"" part is that one boundary is *only* about presentation and the other boundary is *only* about the calculations.

&gt; A feature that's a ""single responsibility"" in my mind might very well be composed of 10 responsibilities in someone else's mind.

Every project has an architecture, and dividing out the responsibilities is the product of the ""mind"" responsible for defining the architecture. Every architect (if we're allowed to use this term) will have a different intuition about the division of responsibilities that makes sense.

&gt; Let's take this article, we have a bunch of subclasses of CPU, Monitor and Keyboard.

The article is dumb. It defines a bunch of classes without defining the problem that is being solved and why these classes are being created.

I'm sympathetic though, because these principles require intuition about the context to apply properly, and it's kind of hard to define a principle in isolation stripped of the context without resorting to stupid examples. Like hierarchies of animals and the sounds that they make.

&gt;  I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to make subclasses

The reason to create sublcasses should be viewed in light of a principle, such as OCP. For example, I have often made use of the [template method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern), which is one way to implement OCP.

With the template method pattern, you are defining common behavior and stubbing out extension points with abstract methods. This is a common way to achieve code reuse. But, when you use OCP, it is even more important that you follow SRP, because if the common class has too many responsibilities, the side effects of changing base class behavior will be significant, because its subclasses will now be impacted. So, you should limit the number of reasons the base class has to change based on the side effects you are trying to control (aka, the single responsibility).

Ultimately, high level principles are hard to describe in concrete terms. My favorite example are the large number of monad tutorials, where everyone thinks they have found a better way to explain what a monad is (a monad is like a burrito...). A monad is a simple concept, but is so abstract that it is hard to put into words without sounding like word salad. The best joke though is this:

Now - the fact whether it is registred is not the important part. Trademarks and names have some protections even unregistered, it is just harder to enforce the - especially in international cases.

With that in mind - courts, especially in US, have a very practical approach to these problems. For anyone who works with software licences it is clear what GNU AGPL is. It is enough.

The main reason why this doesn't matter is that this is looks like a mistake on neo4j part. Given what they say now their intent is clear, and they have right to protect things they licence despite making such mistake.

I wouldn't say ""way bigger"" since package managers make many things faster and easier than on windows, but yeah, there's a lot of details that work out of the box on Windows and not on Linux. And it's a pain.  
  
But there's another side to it. My experience with Windows 10 has been pretty bad and it's not getting any better. Firstly I don't want to use ""OS as a service"" that I have no real control over as a work tool, and secondly I have encountered many bugs, deprecated drivers for not that old hardware etc. on W10.

To expand upon what I was saying before: factors such as address, income, and criminal record correlate to race _because_ systemic injustice has pushed people of color into segregated neighborhoods, lead to wealth disparity between white and black demographics, and disproportionate sentences against black Americans as opposed to white Americans. Training ML systems on this data shows the computer these correlations, and any model worth its salt will absolutely pick up on those trends.

What we need is to replace the broken systems that have created this injustice.

4679,"Hi: disgruntled former employee of one of these AInHR companies here.

This is a common refrain from the folks inside these companies, and in practice it is a very reductive argument.

_In theory_, building a model then identifying which features correlate to protected classes and trimming those features out would be optimizing a process to remove bias and make the system less discriminatory.

However, it is never that simple. Using your example: it's true that a person's race should nit factor in to a hiring decision, so it seems like if you take out the question responses to race and ethnicity from the ML tool's training set and input, discrimination on that couldn't happen, right? Except, especially when taken in aggregate, many other factors in soneone's application _will_ correlate to their race: [their address](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), [their income](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618815441), [their criminal record](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/). So now, factors which you would be hard pressed to argue should _not_ be evaluated for their loan qualifications end up being discriminatory anyway.

This is why understanding racism and other forms of mamrginalization as systemic oppression is so important. The issue cannot be addressed by trying to filter out the surface level biases -- a large scale, systemic change must be made.

ML based products for hiring _cannot_ be audited as you describe, for a number of reasons.

As many others in the comments have said, auditing the data and decision paths for ML models is complex work, that is often an entire project for any particular use of the model. In this case, that would mean any individual candidate's complaint would need extensive data science rrsearch to determine what really msde the decision happen. With the volume of candidates going through these interviewing processes, this _cannot_ logistically happen with how the ML systems are built and understood at this point.

But even if that process were made more plausible (through research or refinement in the tools), it still would never occur because of capitalism. The ML models developed by these companies are proprietary software that are kept hidden from public visibility to protect IP. Or at least this was the practice at my former employer, and many other assessment companies we saw as competitors. When complaints were made about the system being discriminatory, the company response would be that their data scientists were hard at work to remove those biases.

Yet at the end of the day, I stick to Windows when I don't have to or need to use Linux, I don't see a difference between the two operating systems in terms of performance (though if you're on a potato, then the difference might be obvious) and even outside gaming, Windows supports things like MS Office and a lot of content creation tools that, even though I only use them occasionally, I find myself missing when on Linux.",1649510968,programming,NamerNotLiteral,programming,Comment,202

What this means os that the HR teams who purchase this software aren't committing themselves to hiring exactly who the algorithms say to hire, they just have numbers that are supposed to imply who makes more sense to take further in the interview pipeline.

Which is not to say this is not still an awful practice: what this means for candidates is they have opaque, inhuman steps in the interviewing process that they get literally zero feedback on why they did well or poorly. Frankly, they probably don't even know if they did well or poorly, just that they didn't get the job. On the HR side, meanwhile, they have a pipeline sifting through _a lot_ of candidates at a time -- the largest companies we were working with would have thousands of candidates taking our assessment phase _per day_ -- and screen out the vast majority of those right at the start -- only maybe three or four of those people would go on to the next stage.

There's a certain level of sense to it: in theory resumes are useful to be a short summary of a person's past experience so you can get a quick overview and narrow in from there. In practice, a lot of HR teams use resumes as a pre-screening step, filtering for specific key words or phrases, excluding very qualified people simply for not having the specific checklist of things that their process is looking for.

4707,"I would rephrase the title of the referenced article to : the number of web apps will increase by 80% by 2024 and most of this increase will be attributed to low code/no code frenzy. 

I would add that low code/no code, because it is accessible to any Dick and Joe out there, is an enabler for the proliferation of useless apps. Studying programming and programming language is an investment- an intellectual investment- and the good apps that you see out there are the result of putting together many building blocks, from visual structure, design, behavior, SEO, and data structuring and optimisation. Each of these aspects typically are translated into dedicated languages, for good reason.

Once you have made this investment, you are responsible for integrating a wide variety of considerations to your project. Digitisation is not a goal but a means to attain a serious business objective.

Business developers mostly have costs in mind, and are very frequently intellectually confronted to the (useful) technical complexity of applications and implementation. This is humbling and thwarts the idea of ‚Äúself-made man‚Äù. And no-code/low code has given them the illusion that 1) this complexity is useless and 2) this complexity can be taken away and enable business developers to engage their digital strategy just as brilliantly (or more so!) by themselves than with the support of engineers. 

I believe that this message was received by non technical entrepreneurs as an ego-booster : this is natural. A typical average so called entrepreneur has many ideas, conceptual ideas, good sometimes, but statistically mostly bad, and they love to dream of ‚Äúdoing it themselves‚Äù because again, statistically, they are bad at project management and delegation, and mostly don‚Äôt have the financial means and, in some cases don‚Äôt want to bother or have failed to effectively raise seed cap to afford engineers.

No code and low code is an enchanting illusion. Many people went ‚Äúhah! You see, we can actually get rid of these so called expensive engineers. I can do just the same without having to learn programming languages.‚Äù

Nothing could be more wrong and backwards.

What these Bubble.io and other platforms have done is to take a complex adult task - that is, speaking with concision in sentences that are contextually appropriate and well connected to one another - and reduced them to legos that represent only the verbs. They then went to toddlers with the legos and said, here, we fast tracked it for you. You can speak coherently with just these legos, have fun and to hell with these arrogant adults! 

So now immature babies (metaphor) are spreading bad apps and taking up server ressources (bad for environment). We don‚Äôt need more apps out there, we don‚Äôt need more poorly equipped middlemen, we don‚Äôt need yet another platform enabling the proliferation of redundant applications, more middlemen that don‚Äôt know how to get anywhere without relying on other middlemen -who feast on this- like Zappier and Integromat- because they don‚Äôt want to be bothered with the idea of integration and API‚Äôs (in the era of microservices!!!). We need businessmen and real developpers to work together, and have the investment that this collaboration represents filter out bad ideas and force a higher level of concern in identifying what solutions already exist and if they are worthwhile. We need responsible applications designed with a proper 360 degree view of what IT is to enable optimisation and security. You can‚Äôt build an app responsibly if you don‚Äôt know the first thing about how a program interacts with a browser and database; the fact that when a Bubble.io tells you that they take care of the heavy lifting for you so you can go and focus on their poorly responsive, non-migratable environment- and that you take it at face value- is the fundamental problem.

Yes, developing a digitised business is complex. You cannot skip that part (either investing in learning or in engineers). Learn your languages, be responsible, and stop being fooled by companies who sell you simplified environments that cannot thrive or scale in the long run. Short thinking is incompatible with intelligent and responsible business strategy.

I had all the physical rules to simply and quickly create augmented training examples since the signals are common channel electrical signals.

Problem: management kept asking me to predict and guarantee model performance on broad sets of unseen target classes.

I kept explaining to them that despite extremely high accuracy on the augmented training set that generalizability would be bad to impossible without collecting at least a handful of examples from the unseen targets. Management kept not getting it and kept making promises to clients without any willingness to spend an FTE on data collection.

So I left.

The company just kept believing its own bullshit and I couldn't have a real discussion about what would get a model across the finish line.

There was one more major problem too. Our other ML classifiers were built on data from physical simulations 1) scaled down and 2) built entirely from minds of the engineers not from data and 3) the physical model was meant as a sales piece not for research.

- daily stand ups should be about ""asks"", ""helps"" and ""FYIs"", not going over a board, since the board should be visible to everyone at all times (project it on a screen next to the build pipeline status or something)
- just estimate stories on small, medium, large and nothign else... Anything more granular doesn't make sense and results in long discussions on whether a story is 2, 3 or 5 points. If anything seems larger than large, split it up. Most importantly: keep track how long the team takes to get a small,medium or large story released (preferably in production). Whenever a PO brings a new story in, estimate it quickly using S, M or L and he will very quickly get a good idea on how long it would take to release, so he can prioritise and plan future releases, although I would argue you should move to full CD and deliver each story into production separately.
- pair programming, when done right, is the best way to deliver high quality software into production. Its the best way to share knowledge on code (code reviews become obsolete) and when combined with test driven development it allows you to be very confident with code quality. The idea is to switch very often between driver/passenger and even switch pairs within the team. Good resource: https://youtu.be/RCDfBioUgts
- a Product Owner is a role that can be picked up by anyone, sometimes the manager or sometimes the designer role is mixed with PO role and done by the same person. The PO priorities the stories based on effort and business value, least effort with highest value coming first. A designer makes sure the story is designed according to the requirements of the end user of the product, in terms of UI flow, useability and functionality PoV, maybe just the REST API specs if you're building an API.

Often bad incomprehensible papers are incomprehensible *because* they are bad and not worth reading. And a lot of the time papers leave out critical details so even if you do make the effort to decode what they're saying you still don't have enough information at the end to use the idea.
* Code is rarely *deliberately* incomprehensible. People just aren't good at writing clear code or they don't care. On the other hand papers are often written in a deliberately obtuse style to make them sound cleverer. Makes understanding it all the more annoying.

In the hiring space, ML is merely a form of recruitment automation - that is, doing exactly what the manual system does, just faster and more consistently. 

Unfortunately in recruitment, as in many ""people making decisions about people"", there are inherent biases in the system based on race, religion, sex, sexuality, nationality, etc etc. Some conscious, many unconscious. 

Thus, when you use ML to automate the process you don't get a process that finds and picks better candidates. You get one that's better at picking the same candidates humans would anyway. Thus you get a system that's still racist, just faster. 

There are some who scoff at the concept that computer systems and algorithms can be racist. But it's well established as a fact now in the AI/ML field. When the training models used are biased (nearly always unintentionally) then the output too must be. 

This was demonstrated starkly when the first object recognition libraries started appeared. People with black or very dark skin noticed the algorithms would completely ignore their existence in pictures. They'd pick out all the white people, but couldn't see the black people. 
Turns out that when your big tech engineers are 99% white and Asian and they test their software on themselves, then your software develops an uncanny biase towards white and Asian norms.

4809,"&gt; Not just in terms of performance (contiguous memory, ability to live on the stack and be passed by value, and embed other structs by value, etc), but also in terms of programming convenience.

You are assuming that structs are stack allocated while classes are heap allocated. While this might be the common behavior in languages like C#, it does not work that way in languages like C++. In C++ the only difference between structs and classes is the default visibility.

While the definition of what a struct or class is changes depending on the language the two represent difference concepts. Usually structs are just plain data containers with no logic attached to them. Classes on the other hand bundle data and logic, which allows them to hide data fields as their methods provide the means to access and manipulate the data.

Your examples with `Point` and `Rect` play into the common usages for a struct like behavior. They are essentially just data containers where we want to access and manipulate all the data directly. With a more complex system this ""we can access everything"" behavior leads to problems. Imagine a bank account where you can access the amout directly. This surely isn't going to cause some problems down the line /s

&gt; You can trivially create an instance of a struct without needing to call a function or assign values to all members. 

You can also create a class with only public fields and a default constructor.

&gt; Compare to classes in Typescript: when you declare a class member, you must initialize it in the constructor or provide it a default value (which is just syntax sugar for initializing it in the constructor).

This stems from the fact that JavaScript classes under the hood are glorified JavaScript objects. JavaScript objects do not have a fixed layout and act like a dictionary. As such, properties only exist in a JavaScript class once it has been written to once. Without initializing all the required properties in the constructor they simply do not exist. There is also no way for TypeScript to provide default values for your properties without introducing the concept of what those defaults would be.

&gt; Embedding structs lets you mass-assign multiple fields by mere assignment.

That is a feature that is language specific and not necessarily struct specific. There is no reason why this would not be possible with classes as well.",1649492857,programming,GiveMeYourGoodCode,programming,Comment,404

Imagine that you find out that your employer pays you less than other employees. And then you find out this is true of every employee that has your same religious denomination.

You go, complain to your boss, but it's ignored, you keep going up, but it keeps getting shot down. With written evidence that the company won't fix this, you, and the other employees of your religious denomination sue the company.

The evidence is damning. Now let's imagine what excuses the company could use:

* They didn't intend to, and have no rule.
   * But isn't it strange this just ""happens by coincidence""?
* They find out it was a guy in HR that had the bias, he's been fired.
    * But why didn't the company do something when you told them? Why did they wait until the lawsuit? What if the company hired the guy because he was going to be doing this?
   * Also you're not suing the boss, but the company, which acts as it's employees.
* They didn't try anything and any actual finding is because of ""rogue employees"".
     * This is a mix of both of the above.
     * And this hints at a bigger cultural problem, opening lability for hostile work environment.

So the company can't really blame it on someone acting, it claim they just didn't realize this is happening, especially if a complaint was made and they didn't act immediately.

Now what if I change ""rogue employee"" for ""computer algorithm""? Well we find ourselves in the same situation. Companies would have to be able to prove that their ML algorithm isn't bias, after all at some point you have to wonder if they didn't choose the algorithm because it discriminated. They wouldn't use unvented ML algorithms because they'd be a liability.

There's probably a middle ground here. But they problem is that hiring companies that abuse ML are unwilling to compromise.

1. The point is to discuss the tickets by going from ticket to ticket. It is not about each person taking turns to talk. Also, we don't focus much on what happen yesterday, only so far that it informs our strategy for today. (i.e. there is no shaming going on).
2. The team has a mandate and scope to do their work. They don't need a manager around everyday to ask for permission to do their job. Sure, sometimes something from another team will need a nontrivial chunk of time which can disturb the sprint, in which case you can go talk to the PO and/or manager to organise it. But that should be less than once a sprint on average.
3. The granularity of story points isn't suitable for any kind of planning more than a couple of sprints, and team should not be adding story points to tickets months in advance. It is just too fine grained.

Recently, though, some signs are emerging that Agile‚Äôs power may be fading. A new moment of reckoning is in the making, one that may end up knocking Agile off its perch.""

Wrong. Agile works spectacularly well for many teams. It's the best thing going as the default process for anyone looking to start a project, unless there's a specific need for a different process. (Waterfall is one, and it can work well when the requirements are fixed and well-defined....the fact that these conditions are rare is the reason Agile is usually better.)

The only thing that can ""knock it off its perch"" is if someone invents something better. Nobody has, as far as I'm aware.

The author claims that Agile is a ""mindset"", not a methodology. That was true 20 years ago but it isn't true now. It's a process with a set of roles, tools and practices that reinforce each other. The only problem with it is people who follow the rituals without understanding the reason for them. The results can be ghastly, but that's true of any workplace managed by incompetent people. 

The author claims ""many developers have lost faith in the idea of Agile."" I believe it. It's done badly in so many places. But what are they gonna do? Learn from their mom stakes and do better?

4953,"Okay, you‚Äôre insulting me now. Not cool, mannnn!

But seriously, it actually does prove my point that so many businesses are doing just fine writing JS code for their software. It‚Äôs the free market. And it‚Äôs not like everything gets so entrenched that the industry doesn‚Äôt evolve. If it were so ridiculously difficult to be productive with those languages, then it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have other options. PHP is a thing, and so is Ruby. Hell, you can use C# or Java or OCaml or Haskell to generate your HTML on the server side, send it to the client, and handle live interactive elements with websockets. If the productivity were bad enough with JS, then any business in their right mind would pay the cost to switch languages/frameworks. End of story.

And you  example of COBOL is kinda silly. I mean, it‚Äôs not the worst language in the world‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs very procedural, which I love, because OOP just turns everything into an unmanageable abstract web of interdependent components that nobody knows anything about. But more importantly, when compared to other languages, COBOL represents numbers in a way that is much more closely aligned with how accountants and mathematicians think about numbers. Fractional math actually make sense in COBOL. That is why it was initially used for critical infrastructure at banks and other large businesses, and why it still makes sense to leave it alone. The only thing wrong with it is its awkward syntax and lack of a community network effect, so barely anyone knows the language these days.

Likewise, JS, HTML, and CSS have some serious warts, and I feel pain every time I have to write code in those languages, but I still think they are extremely powerful and productive languages. I hate CSS with a burning passion sometimes, but it‚Äôs extremely effective if you know how to work around its quirks.

Look, at the end of the day, I would rather be writing OCaml or Rust or C++ or whatever (and I do in my spare time), but JS is currently paying my bills and making a lot of money for the company I work for.

5105,"Hi: disgruntled former AI HR company employee here.

Based on some of the comments in this thread: I don't think y'all understand just how bad this situation really is in practice. It's not just ""ML models are hard to get right, but if the right effort is put in this could be worth it!"" My experience working in this industry was that every technique used in this space is scummy, low quality, and _incredibly_ prone to bias. Even assuming the hard work to trim out actively discriminatory model features has been done (which is hard, and frequently _not_ done), the models themselves are often based on sample sets that are 1) subjective and biased data taken from human hiring managers, 2) far too small to make meaningful models off of regardless of quality, and 3) founded on debunked pseudoscience like Myers-Briggs that has already been shown to be discriminatory by other studies.

Frankly, even in the best of circumstances, these systems are rarely accurate even slightly. I once worked on a project integrating with a company that provided basically a flash-game that was supposed to measure your ""core competencies"" and assess which jobs you would be best suited for. In attempting to generate ""real-ish"" numbers to test my integration, I did a speedrun through the games, clicking randomly until I completed the exercises. On the other end of it, I was given a ""90% compatibility"" with the software engineer role.

Also worth noting: the monetary incentives of these AI HR companies is incredibly suspect. They are paid by hiring managers looking to optimize their hiring process, which means there are incentives to promote features that make candidate experiences worse and give more power to hiring managers. In practice, this means that discriminatory hiring practices are actually made _worse_ (since candidates have less capacity to fight against the discrimination they face), but hiring managers are convinced they are solving all their diversity problems because a computer algorithm they paid a bunch of money for is supposedly here to save the day.",1649460952,programming,altik_0,programming,Comment,340
5106,"I feel like feature development has outpaced security development.  
There seems to be a... thing... where ""front end"" (idk how to describe this, but stuff like cheapo software that stands on the shoulders of giants) has a fast pace of feature development, and the system level tools used to make that software (ie the giants) have gone ""hey, we should be releasing loads of new features"".  
Which is great, everyone loves new features and better performance. But they are the giant's shoulders everyone stands on because they deal with the stuff that removes (well, reduces the risk of) RCE.

I guess that's why zero trust (or at least layered security) is so important. The likelihood of CVEs aligning in such a way that leads to compromised systems is massively reduced.

I know... We are all humans, mistakes are made. And with so many options of software out there, of course it sounds like there are new CVEs being announced daily, and that it's not all as bad as it sounds.

5110,"An ML system can typically recover that from the rest of the data.  So no, that's not really a viable answer.  I worked on an LGBT bias issue an a big tech company for a while (not in hiring!), and there are other techniques that work better.

One such technique is adversarial training.  Basically, you construct a model to predict two things: (1) the desired objective, such as whether the candidate would be a good hire, and (2) whether the input is associated with a protected class.  But when training the shared layers you invert the gradients propagated from the second objective.  Then the model essentially learns to be as good as possible at predicting objective #1, but using only activations that are useless for predicting objective #2 (membership in a preferred class).  This effectively not only stops the model from using direct input of protected class, but from inferring it as well, since as soon as any activation in the final layer becomes correlated with a protected class, the backprop of inverted gradients will step in to uncorrelate it.  Indeed, even providing the protected class itself as an input can actually be helpful, as the resulting model will use it to correct for bias associated with that class in the remaining features.

The disadvantage of this approach, though, is that it tends to make training unstable for smaller data sets.  There are other approaches that try to overcome that problem.

5111,"Hi: disgruntled former employee of one of these AI HR companies here.

Different companies provide different strategies to this problem. Some will look at resumes, yes, but there are a lot of different factors they could be looking at. For example, a common strategy is to introduce an ""assessment phase"" to the interview process. This has candidates do some kind of test or screening process to generate data that can be measured by ML models.

The specific company I worked for provided a separate service to basically allow online phone screens, where they would pre-record questions and have the candidates respond via webcam recordings that could be reviewed after the fact. The AI product from that company would generate models based on the video and audio data from those responses, and do a preliminary ranking based on those results.

I also worked on integrations with tools that were basically flash games that allegedly measured personality traits or ""core competencies"" that could be measured and used for ranking candidates. In practice, these are often VERY inaccurate (I was once given ""90% compatibility"" with the job of Software Engineer by following the strategy of clicking randomly to try and speedrun through the screens because I needed to get through to test some actual numbers for my integration).",1649460467,programming,altik_0,programming,Comment,215

5174,"The way the ML model is like trying to explain color to a blind person by having them touch stuff and then saying ""this is red"" or ""this is green"". Given enough data, they may start to realize what color things are just by touching it as intuition (at the worst case, they've memorized every possible thing feels and what color that thing is). Then we ask that blind person to tell us what the color of things are.

The thing is, when a blind person is very well trained, it's amazing how well they can identify colors from just touching things. But we shouldn't confuse this with thinking ""they understand colors"", at least not like a sighted person.

Same here for jobs. A computer doesn't understand human nature, it doesn't understand biases, it doesn't understand flaws. So we have a computer guess what a human would guess when looking at a resume, with the computer never being a human, have no understanding of what a human is, and not being given any explanation of what is a human (or what makes them hirable) beyond saying ""this resume belongs to someone hireable, and this one doesn't"", like giving a blind person an apple and saying ""this is red"" then another apple ""and this is yellow"".

We've confused ""impressive for a machine"" as ""pretty decent for a human"". Some people heard this and extrapolated: we can make people that simply feel color, and it'll be better than eyes could ever be.

AFAIK there isn't even a proof that this is more cost-efficient. What I mean with this is that even if it's not better than most humans, it certainly is cheaper. The thing is when it gets thing wrong there's another cost. So if we save 100x man-hours cost on initial filter HR people, but this results in 50x more interviews, each using 2x man hours of full time employees (high level because they're better filters) who make 20x more, that's an 2000x increase in cost in exchange for a 100x reduction.

And just like marketing, few of the companies that hire external validate the quality of searchers based on % of hire. The only way is that companies would have to hire two companies, then grab the `#hires/(service$cost + interview$cost * total#interviews)` and use that to decide which company is the one that gives you the best employees/$. I've never heard of any company actually doing this research, they simply trust the sell spiel, and the metrics that the hiring companies give (which guess what, are biased to make them look good). The result is that companies choose to focus on # candidates (which is honestly useless if none of them are hireable, but this is an easier target) and see the solution that saturates the hiring pipeline (with trash if needed) for the lowest cost.

* Discussing the board *is the same as* discussing what you will do today. A majority the time you don't need to coordinate with other people so you'll just end up saying ""yeah I'm working on X"".
* Banning managers isn't a great idea because that time you do need to work with someone else you need a manager's authority to get someone else to work with you. This is really important when you have multiple teams and products that work together.
* Story points and ""complexity"" are usually directly tied to quarterly planning or release planning. My team has moved away from any type of points but we still have to tell other teams when features will be released and in our quarterly planning we estimate what features we think we can get done.
* Eh - this I just disagree on principal. My team asks for help and communicates but often one person is responsible for one story/ticket and if that story/ticket can't be done by one person then it probably needs to have been broken down more. Pair programming and whiteboarding are overhyped and not as useful as the programming community makes them sound. 
* The PO really shouldn't be a manager - easily see a conflict of interest there - but they also can't be a developer. They end up in this quasi-dev quasi-manager spot where they dictate what needs to be done but do no development themselves. This basically makes them a manager without power.

1. Dont all the biases that a model might learn exist in a more even more  variable form in the minds of humans that do hiring. 

2. To solve the problem above could you track some sort of statistic against data that you hid from the model. For example, you may know the number of female applicants but you avoid feeding it into the model. You build a separate statistical model, that looks at this data and say ""The initial output seemed to cluster all woman to the bottom of the priority list"". The model result gets classified as a ""High Likelyhood of training bias"", then you retrain until the model learns to ignore such implicit bias. 

Ultimately though with any good hiring system. Human or Machine-Aided.... you will need to track your demographic/diversity stats in multiple systems, and work to make sure you are eliminating hiring biases.",1649453922,programming,versaceblues,programming,Comment,161

5277,"&gt; Could this be solved by simply removing protected class variables from the training model? 

That would be a partial solution, but given the (literal) depth of neural networks these days, they're quite capable of (and indeed designed specifically to) infer those kinds of unstated variables from other content.

E.g. you remove the field of ""gender"" from your application form... but you leave in ""name"" as an input to the model, so it's able to infer ""Julia"" as being a likely `CATEGORY_SOMETHING_LABEL_A` rather than `CATEGORY_SOMETHING_LABEL_B` (it doesn't know what the category is/labels are, but it's inferred the existence of them from the training data). OK, you remove names as an input... but you're still passing in college extracurriculars, and so the AI takes note of the low incidence of clubs like ""Women in STEM"" among ""successful"" applicants. You might not want to cut out extracurriculars entirely, though, so now you need to add some data cleaning to your training data that just removes all instances of those particular extracurriculars and do the same on the input that the applicant submits... except now it's possible to say that you're being biased against women who join those clubs. Also, which extracurriculars are safe to remove? Let's say that women are more likely to join dance clubs -- do you have to filter out dance clubs from extracurriculars? It's really just a nightmare to try to do, especially since modern ML fads are very into ""unexplainable complicated deep neural nets"" as the solution to every problem, so even if you think you caught everything, you can't really be certain because you can't really know what underlying correlations are being used to generate the final result.

The fact of the matter is, so long as society is itself biased, ML models will likely pick up on that, because that's basically what they're designed to do: find significant but unstated/non-obvious factors of statistical correlation in giant piles of data. Since people generally use real-world data as training data, real-world biases will be replicated. 

&gt; And obviously a model should only be used as a tool for discovery, and not a final decision maker.

I mean... even if your model is only used to sort the order in which you'll be going through applicants based on some assigned numerical strength value and never actually ""removing files from the pile"" (metaphorically speaking), if it consistently sorts all the women below the men, you're practically guaranteed to not hire any women unless there's either a low number of overall applicants or you specifically account for that behaviour.

Points should actually indicate both complexity and uncertainty.

If you start putting a lot of high points work in a sprint don't expect to have any idea how much of the work will be finished by the end of it.

Some tasks only become clear once you start working on them and realize how best to implement but it shouldn't be standard practice to have tasks like this in a sprint. So the whole story points thing is very useful in highlighting which tasks need refinement before we add them to a sprint.

As I read it, the license that Neo4j provided is not at all self-contradictory, it's just directly and intentionally contrary to the intent of AGPLv3, which surprises people who want to build on the software.

Neo4j was the original creator, so they are not initially bound by AGPLv3 (or any license).  They chose to create a custom license which is sort of like AGPLv3 but slightly different. When you read that license, and read the text ""...contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,"" you are forced to look back and see that ""this License"" in this case is the one Neo4j wrote, which includes the Common Clause restriction.  ""This License"" is not the APGLv3 license.  Therefore, there is no other ""term that is a further restriction"" beyond the actual license that Neo4j created, and there is nothing that is permissible to remove.

This interaction is what the court means by ""downstream licensee.""  Neo4j was not originally subject to any license restrictions, so their relationship with their direct licensees is different from those licensees' relationship with ""downstream"" licensees.",1649450451,programming,GrandOpener,programming,Comment,192

5354,"C++ metaprogramming is absolutely awful. It's truly, truly, shit. Programming in C++ is full of tricks like SFINAE, old hacks like the preprocessor - D completely sidesteps all of this. It is simply easier to write new code in D than C++. Every C++ file I have ever worked on has just so much visual noise on the screen, which is not the case with D.

Also D doesn't really aim to be a better C++. It still is a better C++ in terms of design as far as I'm concerned, but we do our own things. The GC is one of those things. People like to mock, meanwhile D programmers continue using the GC and are productive because of it. Is it perfect? No, does it matter 99% of the time? No. For the 1% we are aware and are continually making changes to rectify the overly gc-happy mistakes of the past. But keep in mind, a lot of things you lose from not using the GC you never had without it in the first place, there's no free lunch: You have to care about the allocations somewhere whether that's in the language design, post-hoc static analysis, or a library of smart pointers.

The compiler hasn't been closed for a very very long time. The backend was not under an open-source *license* until somewhat recently, for reasons not under our control, but the source code has always been available and has been integrated into fully open source compilers for the best part of 2 decades. 

D does let you write things that are only feasible in D too. The way D metaprogramming works is basically unique to D, especially compared to Rust due to the difference between templates and generics. Unless you start to use macros I'm not aware of any language that lets you as easily write generic code that adapts to the properties of a parametric type quite like D does.

The idea that programming languages live or die solely based on design is pretty cruel. Rust had a good idea at the right time and got propelled in large part by a meme, Go had a big corporate backer etc.

Also, a systems programming language that falls apart when you turn off the GC is kind of a bad joke.

5394,"'older guy's response. I worked heavily in Oracle Forms....even before it was GUI. Pre-mouse, people had to tab through every field on the screen in the order you gave them before they could get to the end and Submit the page. Dumb terminals, so the 'screen' logic was still processed by on server hardware.

Adapting preGUI code to client server took a lot of effort. People would click to jump over fields and skip validation checks. And with a PC client running the code, you had to deploy hundreds of forms programs to hundreds of end user desktops. But would probably miss a few and gets bugs resulting from people running older versions of the code. Oh, and those PCs were connecting directly to the database with the same username / password the user was logging into the app. Mostly the only thing stopping them bypassing the app and updating the database directly with SQL was they didn't know how.

Then came the Browser based forms. I remember the first ones where Oracle had its own java on the PC (long before it owned Java) because they had pumped a lot of fixes just to get Forms to work. That at least solved the deployment problem, and the database could be firewalled off so that it couldn't be accessed from the desktop machines. Surprisingly most of the actual 'processing' was done on the application servers (still mostly C based) and the Java layer was just screen painting. They also came up with some MultiThreaded Server on the database end that meant they could do away with every logged on application user having a dedicated process in the database, and mostly stopped the issue of an end user leaving a transaction open and blocking other users from doing anything.

That was pretty much the last time I worked with Oracle Forms. Oracle bought Sun/Java and invested heavily in rewriting its own application suites with a Java mid-tier and HTML front end.",1649447035,programming,RigourousMortimus,programming,Comment,330

* From industrial/academic collaborations.
* Pure academic practice/implementation papers.
* Pure academic theory papers. Bottom of the list.

The cryptography literature in particular is flooded with algorithms that can't be realistically implemented, which have insanely severe caveats, or which can't be trusted because nobody is checking them and their proofs of security aren't proofs of anything real. They sound useful until you read the whole thing and realize they aren't.

And part is this is that web UI ""standards"" suck at CRUD, despite 25 odd years of trying to solve that. Pounding a square peg into a round hole damages both the peg and the whole.

I've seen Oracle Forms (OF) teams be roughly 4x as productive as web coders. I've never programmed OF myself (for production), but the code seems more compact: less code to do common CRUD things. They are easy to maintain because they have such little code. OF was build to do CRUD and only CRUD, wasn't distracted by video gaming and cat videos. 

Don't get me wrong, OF had warts and was esthetically ugly, but did the CRUD job cheaply. Opponents say the web is ""more flexible"", but the flexibility comes at a big cost. Warren Buffett says one key secret to his success is **bravery to say ""no"" to fads and peer pressure**. Chasing the Jonesdashians has made our dev stacks a bloated mess.

For example, there as a push to make office apps ""mobile friendly"". Most offices I see still do their work on desktops with mice. All the wasted effort to get shit like Bootstrap to behave like a normal GUI was, well wasted. (Bootstrap can eat my bloody shorts!) The fadsters missed the target and everyone pays for it with bloated buggy ""separation of concerns"" code. Separation of Productivity is more like it. 

The only reason such shops had to retire OF is because Oracle rewrote the client in Java Applets, which is buggy and full of security holes. Had they left it in C, it could live on just fine. (OF coders didn't have to change their code much, it was just the client implementation. It's comparable to rewriting Chrome from C++ to Java applets.)

I'm not sure all the alleged limits of OF are mutually exclusive. There may be ways have mobile friendly options and all the other features some claim apps must have/use. We should learn from productive tools like OF instead of throw everything and start over. Chasing ""trendy"" shiny toys is bloating IT. Time for a ""fad diet"", as in vacation from fads.

5472,"&gt;The notion that a competent professional would need to justify his work every day, in tiny units, was absurd to her. 

Well, clearly she's never worked with software developers. 

Jokes aside, the Agile manifesto does not say anything about daily standups. Daily standups are a Scrum artefact, and if you are ""justifying"" your work in them, you *are* doing it wrong. 

And this is not some kind of ""No True Scotsman"" argument but rather *basic reading comprehension.* 

I'll quote the current version of the Scrum guide: 

&gt;The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint  
Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming  
planned work.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum  
Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every  
working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are  
actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as  
Developers.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want,  
as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal  
and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates  
focus and improves self-management.  
&gt;  
&gt;Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick  
decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust  
their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed  
discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint‚Äôs work.

Some things to note: It's a meeting *only with the team's Developers*. No *management* involved. And the purpose is just to see if your plan is still workable and change it if it isn't. It's not about ""justifying"" anything, except *maybe* to your teammates (who are not your managers).",1649442150,programming,Fearless_Imagination,programming,Comment,309

5481,"The only time when single letter variables are actually used, is in abstract, polymorphic code (defining typeclass instances etc). But the single letter variables aren't what makes such code hard to understand. The hard part is figuring out what the abstraction is meant for, how it relates to other concepts and juggling the involved types in your head.

&amp;#x200B;

When writing or reading an average piece of haskell (without lenses) you need about 10 operators in addition to regular arithmetic:

*  Monoids and Semigroups have `&lt;&gt;`
* Functors have `&lt;$&gt;`
* Applicatives have `&lt;*&gt;`, `*&gt;` and `&lt;*`
* Monads have: `&gt;&gt;=` and `&gt;&gt;`
* Function application: `$`
* Lists have: `++` and `:`
* Alternative has: `&lt;|&gt;`
* And i almost forgot about function composition `.`

Which is not that much, especially because you have to learn about the related concepts anyway. The notation is not whats hard (well, getting used to the fixity of `$` takes some time), whats hard is understanding the concept behind the notation.

&amp;#x200B;

Typechecking errors can be absolute garbage, but they are alright most of the time. They tell you where the problem is and what types didn't match and with a good understanding of the type system and a bit of practice you can look at your code and 95% of the time see the problem almost instantly.

* Stand ups exist for developers to grovel and justify their existence.
* Story points are used to score developer performance.
* The PO is just a project manager with a different name.

If you are doing that, then I can see why you hate scrum.

Some tips:

* Stand ups - Drop the whole ""What I did yesterday and will do today"" bullshit. It shouldn't be a status up for management or a grovelling session. It should be a quick planning meeting for day's activities. Discuss the tickets going from right to left on board, and coordinate with each other how to work together to get them moving forward.
* Stand ups - Ban all managers from attending. Having them around doesn't help, it makes everyone act weird.
* Story points exist for the team and PO to help plan out coming work. Management doesn't need to know they exist, nor do they need to know how many story points a developer ""scored"" during a sprint. Just stop it.
* Tickets don't belong to a developer. Jira may only allow a ticket to be assigned to one person, but that is not how you should work. Help each other out, whiteboard together, debug together, even pair program if you want to.
* The PO is part of the team and should not be anyone's manager. Their role is gather and prioritise features and work, and clarify requirements.",1649441374,programming,sime,programming,Comment,275
5499,"anarchism doesn't exclude having people in charge. It excludes having people in positions of authority, that is very different and it's exactly the confusion here.

You can have direction, leadership, organization, without having authority. The direction emerges by legitimacy (we do X because John is more knowledgeable on the topic and always makes good decisions) instead of emerging from authority (the guy with the money decided John is in charge because the guy with the money thinks he's better than us and we have to obey or otherwise we get fired).

I agree with the ""from within"" argument and I'm all about that. We should remove the organizational barriers and economic incentives that want to detach organizational activities from workers. That was also the whole point of the original Agile: let people that know shit decide how to work. The division manager/worker is such barrier: you have to be blessed from above to get the authority to have the function of organizer. And if who's above doesn't get the problem or doesn't know the team, they might pick the wrong person. The alternative, that I lived through more than once, is to distribute leadership and let good leaders take the organizing role when it's most appropriate and let them be free to rearrange the structure of the teams, agree democratically on who should be in charge of what based on the know-how accumulated in years of work.

5631,"&gt;there's no way to know if they're complete nonsense or yields such poor results that they're useless

I agree.  There are so many ways a paper can go wrong, like lack of good controls, lack of good comparison to state-of-the-art alternatives, tainted data, p-values that have been diluted by poor experimental design, or just plain meaningless metrics of success. Sometimes even if the paper is accurate it will be followed over the years by a dozen other papers explaining what implications and extrapolations are warranted, and which ones aren't.

I've read many good articles on the subject, but three that come to mind are this one on the [debate over a paper on programming language vs defects](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/this-is-how-science-happens/):

&gt; if they just said ‚Äúthe premise is nonsense‚Äù, nobody would have listened to them. It‚Äôs only by showing that the FSE authors messed up methodologically that TOPLAS could establish ‚Äúsufficient cred‚Äù to attack the premise itself...  
&gt;  
&gt;there‚Äôs also a deeper point here. We like to think of science as unbiased and purely rational. All we‚Äôre supposed to care about is the facts and the data. But that‚Äôs not the whole story. Signals like integrity, trustworthiness, and reputation matter.

[This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/ivermectin-research-problems/620473/) by James Heathers about how hard it can be to sift through fake data and dishonest research, especially in pandemic studies:

&gt;the pandemic has created a very difficult environment for scientific publishing. In early 2020, a hunger for high-quality information arose immediately... scientific studies were produced at record pace, peer-reviewed almost immediately after they were submitted or else put into the public domain via preprint as soon as they had been completed...  
&gt;  
&gt;We contact the authors of each paper... Sometimes, the authors or journals even reply, although these communications rarely result in any kind of investigation, let alone a serious consideration of the issues raised.  
  
In this environment, no sinister conspiracy is needed to allow for the construction of an irreparably flawed body of literature... John Carlisle, famous in metascientific circles for identifying the most prolific research fraud in the history of medical research... reviewed more than 500 trials submitted to the journal Anaesthesia in the three years leading up the pandemic and concluded that 14 percent of them contained false data. A 2012 survey of researchers at five academic medical centers in Belgium reported that 1 percent admitted to having fabricated data in the prior three years, though 24 percent said they had observed a colleague doing so...

Or a [series of articles on the replication crisis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/failure-is-moving-science-forward/) and what's improving by Christie Aschwanden:

&gt;When 29 research teams working \[on the same data\] with the best intentions (and fully aware that their work will be scrutinized and compared with that of the other teams) can come up with such a wide range of answers, it‚Äôs easy to imagine that similarly earnest efforts to replicate existing studies might also produce different results, whether or not the original finding is correct. The takeaway is clear ‚Äî methods matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Years ago, someone asked John Maddox how much of what his prestigious science journal Nature printed was wrong. ‚ÄúAll of it,‚Äù the renowned editor quickly replied. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what science is about ‚Äî new knowledge constantly arriving to correct the old.‚Äù Maddox wasn‚Äôt implying that science was bunk; he was saying that it‚Äôs only as good as the current available evidence, and as more data pours in, it‚Äôs inevitable that our answers change.",1649437429,programming,suddencactus,programming,Comment,569

For example, it uses ""monads"" (which, jargon aside, are just lazy data structures that describe the control flow of your program) because it's pure, and it's only pure because laziness doesn't mix well with side effects. (and laziness was non-negotiable for the language creators)

The ecosystem is probably the worst part, but it's about what you'd expect from a research language that accidentally leaked into industry.

The syntax is actually simple, though the idiomatic style of using operators everywhere can get indecipherable. Again, this probably comes from a large proportion of code being written in academia, in a research language.

Highly paid professionals usually don't give a fuck about unions, they already earn a lot and have much more leverage over their employer than low paid workers (like Amazon warehouse workers). You don't earn a high salary if you are not in a position to negotiate with your company.

Here's the main problem with that logic: _It fails to take into account the value of the employee_.

E.g. (And I'm going to intentionally ignore that employees cost their company more than just the salary; It doesn't change the point, it just adds a bunch of math)

An employee who creates $50,000 of value for the company has to negotiate much harder for a $30,000 salary than a developer who creates $5,000,000 for the company and is trying to get $100,000.

AGPLv3 says that users of its license must make forks available with solely AGPLv3 bits, which means users are allowed to remove the extra piece of license. However, this doesn't actually make sense, because licenses can't restrict licensors (unless there's other people committing without copyright attribution), so the software was able to keep its whole license. Which follows common sense.

What does suck is that the piece of software doesn't technically count as open source due to that restriction, and it breaks AGPLv3 promises. So you can have software pretending to be free by having e.g. AGPLv3 and other non-free parts.

The conclusion being that you should only believe something as open source if its license is verified enough. Otherwise it might not actually be open source.

I don't have any hard metrics. You need to be immersed in a field to develop a bullshit detector for weasel language and weak statistics. The difficulty learners are faced with, looking at the literature from the outside, is they haven't yet built up the socially-embedded model of who the bad actors are and what quality reasoning looks like, so they need teachers and mentors to hold their hands through the process.

&gt;All of your doubts seem to come from that article, now I've finished reading it. Which is discussing papers in the field of Psychology

I chose this article because it is a good intro written for a broad audience, not the argument is unique to that poster or that field.

Psychology has indeed been an epicenter for the replication crisis, being sufficiently fuzzy and manipulable. But it also has repeatable experiments and well-understood statistical tests that can be subject to replication. You can also use a few heuristics like sample size and multiple comparisons corrections to evaluate the rigor of a study, or see those comparisons made in a meta-analysis. So there's low-hanging fruit for criticism and comparisons.

Computer Science doesn't do as much statistical testing or fuzzy experiments, which might make it more trustworthy, or maybe not. It might just be the case that there aren't as many straightforward experiments that can fail to replicate. At the same time, I don't know if we've seen a comparison between the recent explosion of crap ML papers, and the quality level of old psychology results. As works become more qualitative and mysterious, they become more hackable and vulnerable to publication bias.

Not reaaaaally.

Here's the thing:

&gt; GPL = can use; cannot link

_What the hell is linking?_ Legally, that is.

The GPL, very helpfully, does not bother to define the term directly. Instead deferring to the rather weasly and _not legally binding_ FAQ.

The GPL very explicitly declares that dynamic linking is still linking. It's legal text spells out the even broader `shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.`

""initimate data communication"" covers ... essentially fucking everything.

Take web APIs. Is required use of those ""linking""? Must you now give up the server-side source code?

If not web APIs, what about local machine networking, like the various IPC?

(And if you don't, well, what's to stop anyone from creating a ""LGPL-wrapper""-like wrapper that just bundles your GPL code and sticks it on a different machine? The AGPL that's an even worse dumpsterfire?)

The only main exception here is ""System Libraries"" that aren't distributed with the program. (Which opens up questions about companies creating windows OS-images for fleet management)

Thus the true problem with the GPL; It is not merely ""virulent"", taken at face value it requires that you never interact with anything that isn't part of the broader GNU Cinematic Universe, or sanctioned exceptions. (Read: Microsoft Windows &amp; other proprietary OSes)

And you may rightfully say ""Woah you're taking everything at it's widest plausible interpretation, that's clearly not the spirit of the thing!"", and sure. I am.

But that is for two reasons:

1. Lawyers want to avoid liability where possible.

2. There's a fair amount of GNU weirdos who do the same and will harass and bother you if you don't abide by every little technicality.

---

Thus, personal opinion: It's a lot easier to just slap MIT/Apache on your code and call it a day. If a company can use my code and build upon it to create a proprietary derivative work or service they can charge money for, then that's just ... fine? ""Fuck you, pay me."" applies to them as well.

Even better were PhD theses about a topic. Usually longer and way more detailed because this stuff actually matters for the student. But of course, you won't get the hottest new research here.

Computer Science is more aligned with the why and proving it through theorems. Unfortunately, more corporations, non-profits, and government agencies don't distinguish the difference and the schools have not articulated the difference so most companies throw Comp Sci grads into mini-skills to get the grads to know how to program in Python, .NET, or whatever the flavor of the day is instead of understanding why to hire a programmer from a technical school, an engineer, or a scientist. At the end of the day, most programmers are essentially code monkeys with no agency about what and how to develop. When you work for a company like mine that has a ton of different apps and new management comes in and mandates the whole company move from ASP.NET to Python because Python is ""fast"" to develop, then you realize they don't understand the nuances between different kinds of developers, engineers, scientists, etc. and each of their strengths and weaknesses.

People get themselves in situations where they think they can just pump out more work with more hours, but find they can't. So they add more hours to compensate. This makes them even more tired and their all hours worth less. So they add a bit more. 

And if they lose motivation for even a few hours, they get more behind. Because there is no buffer. No remaining personal hours short of sleep they could sacrifice to get back on track.

There are Winforms APIs that use `delegate` from the .NET 2.0 era (2005) which were created before lambdas were introduced to C#, to which you can pass lambdas perfectly fine.

a few more steps in the ideology and you almost have invented the idea of religion haha.

&gt; It feels like at every angle of my life I'm constantly bombarded with reminders of how I could be doing this thing better or how if I don't keep up with things xyz fast enough I'll fall behind.

its not about falling behind but more like just reading up on some general things that happen in your time period and figure out which knowledge should take space up in your head and delegate the rest. (e.g. no need to learn the entire ECMP algorithm by heart, but you should know have *some idea* of what it is when people say weighed priority, if you read up on anything related to weighed priorities youll understand faster and things start becoming more second nature. Just consume any info that seems 'fun' to you. Soon the amount of puzzle pieces will start to form a coherent picture in you.

&gt; It feels so much worse in this industry as well where the pace of development outpaces the rate in which I can learn new things.

I think thats the fascinating bit, because everything changes so much there are bugs and issues happening everywhere, that means you will always have a job for the foreseeable future. When you learn new things; go on a 'need-to-know' basis. The more needs you have the harder it will be so try to tackle small problems first.

&gt; It feels like there's no possible way to keep up with everything in a fulfilling or successful manner.

Treat it like a talent tree in an rpg. if you want to be a frost mage you gotta put stuff into the frost talent tree, the more you seperate the skill points the harder it becomes to be super effective in one. ie. You dont need to learn C or C++ to write code in python

5886,"&gt;If it's highly cited then it's probably a reliable paper.

[Higher impact factor (more highly cited) journals have lower replicability indexes.](https://kirkegaard.substack.com/p/higher-impact-factor-journals-have?s=r)

Citations are not a useful measure of anything, and might even be a negative indicator. Increasingly diverse indicators published over the past decade agree on this.

The reason to be biased *against* prestige journals and highly cited papers are:

- papers get more attention for being more ""important"" (e.g. statistically significant or high effect size), not for having rigorous methods
- but, for well understood statistical reasons, the more ""extreme"" a paper is from the pack in terms of claiming an impressive outcome, the more likely that is to have been a fluke that fails to reproduce, or to have been otherwise erroneous
- meanwhile, rigor is hard to judge and reviewers usually don't have the time or information to evaluate it
    - worse, rigor is like a self-censorship filter that reduces your likelihood of claiming an impressive result in the first place, so researchers are in an analytical arms race to generate noteworthy results at the margins of statistical power

Prestige journals are directly rewarded for being associated with ""important"" results, while only weakly penalized for below-average quality, so they act as filters for big names in the field, or more significant findings, while systematic reviews fail to show they produce higher quality studies (bigger sample sizes, more statistical power, etc).

&gt;That's why peer reviews are so important

""Peer review"" is basically a hoax and anyone working in science should regard it like a pro-forma ritual used to dupe naive outsiders into thinking the institution takes rigor super seriously and holds itself accountable. The reality is that many participants assigned to do ""peer review"" on a submission won't even have access to the code or data necessary to evaluate it, and almost no reviewers will attempt to replicate your statistical analysis.

The absolute best thing I can say about peer review is it on rare occasion gave me chance to help reject a couple extremely bad articles that were obviously incorrect or misleading on their face, but that's a weak filter, and competent bullshit artists know how to get junk work through it.",1649429493,programming,anechoicmedia,programming,Comment,365

We'll see if they ever do.
4. Same as for (3) - the original API did allow that and internal APIs still do, but they consider this kind of UI/fiber hackery to be an ""advanced"" use case (it's very server focused) and not in scope for v1.

However, you should consider that there are other very similar ways to do what you want that don't involve controlling the thread scheduler. For instance you can start a virtual thread to control your animation, which simply writes a lambda/callback with the actual rendering instructions to the standard, non-virtual GL thread. That thread simply sits in a loop invoking callbacks and flagging sync objects when the lambda is done or a time is reached. The virtual threads sit and block, representing the animation logic. Because the blocking of those virtual threads is ""free"" you can be explicit about which part of the code needs to be run on the GL thread vs which part can be blocking for sequencing reasons. The efficiency should be the same.",1649425953,programming,okgofigure85,programming,Comment,295

So it doesn't feel like it changes much there. The same tradeoffs existed as before and you can't remove those, because they're inherent to having multi-core hardware.

By the way, the only reason (AFAICT) that Loom doesn't expose continuations or explicitly scheduled fibers directly, is to reduce the scope of the work needed to ship it. The infrastructure is all there. If there is genuinely demand for running lots of fibers on a single platform thread in order to elide locking, it could be added quite easily. The question is how many people really care about that. They did some explorations of it early on for the GUI use case but concluded it's not really an upgrade. After all, even if you schedule every fiber onto the GUI thread you still have to think about concurrency because every blocking point becomes a potential re-entrancy point.

5975,"&gt; The flaw the author's central argument is that the degree to which a programming language is complicated doesn't necessarily reflect the extent to which it uses syntax and language features to reduce cognitive load on programmers, and in many cases adds it because language features can interact in weird ways. Think of all the rules you have to remember for constructors and destructors in C++, for example.

The author specifically touches on this in the post script of the article. I'll quote the most relevant part here:

&gt; All the language features in the examples above - classes, advanced types, and the borrow checker - have an important trait in common: They all feel like they emerge spontaneously from existing code independently of whether the language designer has thought about them. In that sense, they are the best kind of feature; instead of adding new things to worry about, they merely provide a vocabulary and tooling for dealing with already existing problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Not all language features are like this. For example, Julia has four different ways of defining a function, and just as many variations on how a for loop looks. One can define a type to be a struct, mutable struct, abstract type and primitive type (all the former possibly parametric). Types can be placed in the type hierarchy as either concrete types, abstract types, union types or unionall types. The representation of types (i.e. type of types) can be either DataType, Union, UnionAll, or Bottom.",1649424066,programming,AdaGirl,programming,Comment,250

&gt; There is almost zero try/catch in the vast majority of my C++ code base

Then the only overhead you should have in Rust is the extra `-&gt; Result&lt;‚Ä¶, MyGlobalError&gt;` at function declaration and the extra `?` at every fallible function. It‚Äôs not zero, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that it obscure the code (especially since the most impactful change is the `?` which is very discrete).

&gt; And this brings up one issue that Rust has. There are two types of RAII doo-dads. One type creates and owns the thing it manages. The other applies some change to something else on a scoped basis. The latter type can't really be done in a useful way in Rust, because that would require that it maintain a mutable reference to the thing it would restore when it drops.

I think that you don‚Äôt know that you can reborrow the object that is inside your scope-based guard. I‚Äôve done a full example on the [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=4013cef1c608b1adb3324b14645e0fc5), but this is the gist:

        let s = &amp;mut guard.s; // reborrow the inner object

5999,"You should note, that I'm not against 40 or 80 characters columns, but having two or more of them side-by-side. There is and never was in digital formats a good reason for that. Even if the writer had been limited to 40 character column display, but you had access to 80 character column display, neither would have practical reason to format the text to be on two text columns on your screen. Commands for navigating the text would get much harder to implement, the text format would need to have much more than just the text and that formatting information would easily be incompatible between the versions such early software and hardware anyway. And if your screen heights (in glyph lines) did not match, you would not even save in button presses (be it page down or line down). Now if the formatting was done automatically by your text viewer, than that would be a different thing, but then it would not require such formatting in the underlaying data.

The reason for multiple columns was in the printing side. If the computer written text had line splits (possibly mid word) for 40 character lines, then it would take lots of not trivially automated work to reformat it for printing or waste lots of paper for having such narrow column in journal sized paper alone. 

Also text wrapping based on word splits and display width in characters has existed practically as long as output has been symbols on screen rather than printouts to slips of paper.

The modern format for these journals also contain full page wide header parts and images, which would not have been practical for computer displays that had column count limited to ""half-page width"", so we can't really use that limitation to justify such format.

And then there is the fact that most old computer science papers don't actually have this problem, maybe because they where written with typewriters or by hand and then went the university's print rather than some journal. Or maybe because the limited columns on writing screen where not really a problem when printing was willing to format it well.",1649422372,programming,Xywzel,programming,Comment,357

6025,"In theory, yes.

There's a risk that a company takes advantage of MIT by suing over patent infringement. The scenario goes something like:

1. company starts contributing code
2. maintainers merge change into next release
3. company turns around and sues project because code is patent-encumbered

Apache protects against this because step 1 comes with an explicit patent grant: within the context of the project, that company cannot sue.

This makes some large companies feel safer with Apache projects, but also, this means more bureaucracy, as contributions from engineers within such a company may now have to run each contribution by the internal legal department.

In practice, I haven't heard that scenario happen a lot. It would also instantly make a company persona non grata in the OSS ecosystem, so I'm not sure there's that much of a practical risk.",1649420496,programming,chucker23n,programming,Comment,140

6058,"&gt;You start off by saying that overly complex language is punished, but then follow up by saying the language is tailored to others inside the academic club, and that it must be so because acceptance = publication = conference = money.

My point was actually less about language, but about the way in which ideas are described and presented, which is more a paper organization/storytelling thing. 

My favorite example is about ""simulated annealing"", which is an algorithmic technique for heuristic optimization. As an undergrad, I thought that before using it, I should read the original paper introducing it.

That paper was only a few pages long, but full of physics that is very complicated to CS people, because it targeted a physics audience. But what simulated annealing does is to salvage an intuition from the field of physics and to use it in a different context, namely ""black-box optimization"", which has nothing to do with physics. So later I found a description in a textbook that was like half a page long, including the pseudo-code that was \~6 lines or so. Reading it once made it immediately clear what simulated annealing does.

So why was the original paper so seemingly bad? Because it was written for people with a physics background who want to know what the idea is and what it entails...from a foundational perspective. If you want to know how the implementation looks like, all these lines of text are pointless.

Uninclusive use of language would be to use convoluted sentences, unidiomatic phrases and unnecessary technical terms (but using the necessary ones, which can happe once a point cannot be consicely made while avoiding them).

6099,"&gt; the problem is await which requires that it occurs inside of an async function

That's the whole point of using an awaiter service: it allows you to move an awaitable object out of the sync function.

‚Äî But I want to get and process the async result.

Wrap it into a continuation (`then`, `ContinueWith`, `map`).

‚Äî But callbacks are ugly and not composeable.

Await inside an async closure and send the closure to the awaiter.

‚Äî But caller wants the result.

Return the awaitable and let them await the result.

    ensurePuppiesLoaded() {
      let el = this.puppiesRootElement;
      this.busyMaskWithSpinner.spawn(el, async () =&gt; {
        let puppies = await this.model.getAllThePuppies();
        puppies.sort(this.puppiesSorter);
        this.puppiesList.items = puppies;
        return puppies;
      });
    }

‚Äî But caller wants the result, not a future/promise/task.

Redesign the caller. The caller's caller must do the awaiting and pipe the data between sync functions. Escalate until you hit the entry point of the program or the framework.

And this is a best practice anyways. See Mark Seemann's ""From dependency injection to dependency rejection"" for more elaborate example.

6103,"&gt;Fast base salaries were top of the market. For senior software engineers, Fast offered $200-240K/year in base salaries with full remote work. They offered this range not just in the US, but outside it, when hiring in Europe, converting the base salary to Euros (‚Ç¨180-‚Ç¨220K/year).

200k‚Ç¨/yr as a _base_ salary is absurdly high in Europe. Who even asked for this?

True. I would say that if 10% of images coming out of it are spotless so-to-speak, this is going to replace some human illustrators.

&gt; The value of computer generated images is likely to be low

That depends entirely on who they replace. This can replace the majority of concept artists already, as they only produce draft-quality art by their job definition as creative spitballers.

Each 5 hours of concept artist time replaced with 10 trials of a 5 minute button-click-and-bake makes for 4 hours of labour saved. That is, to a design shop with 5 illustrators on roster, access to DALL-E 2 for 38 hours a week, 250 days a year is worth the salary of the four concept artists you will almost certainly lay off.

In actual practice, this is only somewhat true. If, as is often the case, you are simply passing the value of an async function up the call chain, you can actually leave `await` and `async` out:

    // Due to convention that functions returning Tasks are named ...Async
public Task&lt;Foo&gt; getFooAsync(Bar bar) {
    var fooParams = getFooParams(bar);
    ValidateFooParams(fooParams);

I don‚Äôt blame the crystal devs at all, it is hard to develop a new language and more if you are based on a highly dynamic/mutable language as ruby.

I know the work that goes into everything you mentioned.

And I also know that most of the human decisions that take place are either purely creative/discretionary/to taste or adhere to patterns one can intuitively""grok"". You can pattern-follow / cargo-cult your way to glory for most of the decisions, most of the time.

AI is already very, very good at this sort of mimcry.

You rightly point out that current commercial AI offerings have a lot of smoke and mirrors. When AI things are off in design, they are off in very uncanny-valley ways, totally unsuitable for mainstream adoption.

The underlying tech is to create unlimited variations on photos, logos, lock-ups, website layouts etc. starting with nothing but text prompts is 90% there ""naively"" / on the surface, and maybe one third there technologically.

Another ten years of progress will almost certainly bring these capabilities to completion.

It won't be long before technical fine-tuning such as ensuring accessibility compliance, layout and asset responsiveness, visual hierarchy etc. is automated as well and built right into the AI's generative process.

All that will be left is creative direction, and that too will have a limited lifespan ‚Äî at its heart, creative direction in commercial design applications is optimisation for constraints of the medium, the human being, and marketing objectives, and good ol' satisfying the design director's whims.

The process for optimising interaction of media and humans for some commerical objective is already being automated through analytics and direct measurement of the human state. Look at how effective TikTok's addiction machine is, and all the AI has control over is a bloody recommendation engine. 

We ain't seen nothing yet. Imagine looping an experience-design AI into the process, something like metrics go in, JSX hot-reloaded views come out, personalised per user.

GPT-3 can already generate some Figma files and working UI code. These are just the early days.

*However*, papers are still often difficult to read for those not from the respective community because in order to make it into the good conferences, they need to be optimized to appeal to reviewers from the respective community.

And these look for completely different things than, e.g. a programmer who wants to implement an approach from a paper. The focus in a paper is normally on the conceptual contributions and how it relates to the current knowledge in the field. The papers answer questions that reader from the community may have when reading the paper and are heavily optimized zo be convincing...to the community.

Now why don't the papers simply have multiple views in the same material for different target audiences? Well, because then they would have a lower chance of getting accepted to the conferences. This takes extra space, and then the paper has a harder time to compete against others in terms of ""result density"". It would also be an open invitation for reviewers to complain about redundancies in the paper, among other things.

Oh and skipping the good conferences is also not feasible for the researchers as they need the ""good"" papers to attract grant money.",1649400481,programming,CorrSurfer,programming,Comment,295

6300,"Lets start first, bringing up Rust is unfair here. That compiler has set an entirely new bar when it comes to useful compiler errors, warnings and lints, that not only explain the issue, point to documentation, but offer useful and valid solutions. So basically it's like judging the decision to build a bridged based on the fact that Michael Phelps could swim to the other side very easily.

Rust also does a great job in that warnings are never things that could be bugs or errors (some rare and notable exceptions exist for things that Rust [is trying really hard to only catch when it's a bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46043) but these are exceptional and considered an issue), but simply signs of sloppy code (ie. unused code and stuff like that) which you wouldn't want on a ""final"" version, but otherwise don't really matter. Sloppiness could also be a sign that you are using an old library which simply uses and older style (which isn't a bad thing, it may be battle-tested and reliable). It also doesn't have a lot of warnings, most people add clippy. But it comes at the same thing: warnings are simply enforcing style, they rarely catch things that could be bugs (and I only say rarely because there may be . And this is also why from the very start you have `#[allow]` because you may have a stylistic decision (like putting a nested `unsafe` block inside the super-extra critical part of the unsafe code, and by marking it as not an accident, you make it clear you intended it for a reason, making people pay extra attention).

The truth is that in a language like C, people will inevitably prefer compilers that are more flexible, because inevitably they want to get shit done, and as long as the code works, it works. This results in huge walls of warnings. Go just realized this was the truth of how it'd be used. You can always require making the linter happy in order to submit code and what not, which makes a lot of sense: we are doing this things towards the end. It requires a bit of discipline for the self-coder, but so does `-Wall` or `-D warnings`.",1649395313,programming,lookmeat,programming,Comment,370

Indicating which function calls could be interrupted can be helpful for lots of reasons.  Performance is easier to reason about, and it can drive architectures which maximize the use of pure functions rather than peppering I/O everywhere.

That there isn't *a* definition mostly.

Sure. Pitman then goes to describe what he considers an object oriented design for representing a game, contrasting it to a more ""FORTRAN-like"" representation that is just an integer array, and separating the two on the basis that, in the latter, ""[the representation of ships] are not recognizable out of context as ships, they are not subject to inspection as ships, and they provide no notion of object identity that would distinguish one ship from another.""

&gt; The definition that I like to use, because I think it is clear and makes the most useful distinction, is the one on Wikipedia:

Ah, the [Green threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads) Wikipedia article has these quotes:

&gt; ""Threads: Green or Native"". SCO Group. Retrieved 2013-01-26. ""The performance benefit from using native threads on an MP machine can be dramatic. For example, using an artificial benchmark where Java threads are doing processing independent of each other, there can be a three-fold overall speed improvement on a 4-CPU MP machine.""

&gt; ""Threads: Green or Native"". codestyle.org. Archived from the original on 2013-01-16. Retrieved 2013-01-26. ""There is a significant processing overhead for the JVM to keep track of thread states and swap between them, so green thread mode has been deprecated and removed from more recent Java implementations.""

Does the new green thread implementation for Java somehow do that better? Or is it only better for these certain workloads and you simply choose whichever JVM implementation matches your workload best (i.e. the JVM without green threads isn't going away)? This history seems never mentioned in that context?

&gt; Whenever you are about to do a blocking call, rather than doing it, it does a non-blocking call [...]

Which is good for certain software. For other you really want to control what the actual syscall is and then this is not possible. I guess you write that software in C/C++ anyway. And if you don't have any threads at all in your software, or only threads in order to use all your cores for calculations, then this green thread runtime adds (a tiny bit) of overhead for (non-)blocking calls without any benefit.

Odin and Go by default initialize everything to zero. Not only is it simpler conceptually, it's also simple to implement: it's just a memset on a byte buffer.

6530,"Yeah. So I don't know Rust myself, but from what I gather, you'll be able to create an object of type `Result&lt;!, i32&gt;` or something? Which would normally be ""either an `Ok(!)` or an `Err(i32)`"", but because you can't create a `!`, it means you definitely have an `Err(i32)`.

And you'll be able to write a function `notOk`, turning a `Result&lt;x, y&gt;` into `Result&lt;x, y&gt;` for any `x` that implements `Not`, with the semantics `notOk(Ok(x)) = Ok(not x); notOk(Err(y)) = Err(y)`.

And so because `!` implements `Not`, you can call `notOk` on your `Result&lt;!, i32&gt;`. It's just going to be the identity function, because you definitely have an `Err`. But it might still be useful; perhaps you're using it in a context where you could have all sorts of things other than `!`.

6531,"I'm curious if anyone else thought that redis [client-side caching](https://redis.io/docs/manual/client-side-caching/), introduced in 6.0, could have helped with batching up writes to clients. It seems that the global write rate would translate to the throughput that the websocket service had to forward to every client. I'd imagine that most of this traffic would be in hot spots due to streamers and war zones. 

Consider if the websocket service batched up writes every 3 seconds. Consider also not using a single bitfield for the entire canvas, but thousands of smaller chunks. Being in separate chunks you could now distribute that over a redis cluster. The websocket servers would use client-side caching to be told that a bucket of keys on the redis server got invalidated due to a write. The websocket server would then refetch that chunk and figure out which pixel changed from its local in-memory cache. It would take these pixel updates and batch them up and send them out every 3 seconds to its clients.  Thus 100 writes to a hot zone could get reduced to 15 updates that represent the snapshot after the 3 seconds of warfare.

Another benefit of sharding it among different keys is that you could then distribute the redis servers around the globe. Consider then having nodes for each shard, one in north america, one in europe, and another in south korea. A background job could slowly perform failover for each shard so the primary is located in the datacenter closest to the sun.

Regarding concurrency, I use async/await to write state machines in games instead of compiler generated ones, where multiple things can be running concurrently, but *never* parallels due to our sync context. Here's an example from a script component that would be difficult with fibers:

It's worth remembering that the JVM ecosystem is *enormous*. You say ""it's perfect when 100% of your code is managed"". Well, that describes the vast majority of Java programs. For a mix of cultural and technical reasons, most Java programs are ""pure Java"" to a much greater extent than in other programming ecosystems where reliance on C libraries is far higher. In particular that's true of .NET where the libraries were mostly implemented on top of Win32 instead of all being reimplemented in C#.

Loom is primarily meant for networking apps. Perhaps in future they'll also implement non blocking filesystem IO, but today, it's for network servers. And network servers can and do run entirely in JVM controlled code, it's standard. Java has its own SSL stack, its own locking and TLS primitives, its own async IO stack, etc etc. You really don't need any native code to write high performance servers in Java.

Meanwhile if you do for some reason need to interact with a native library that has thread affinity (which is rare, basically none do outside of native GUI toolkits/OpenGL), well, then you aren't needing massively scalable threading anyway, so there's no problem.",1649367693,programming,okgofigure85,programming,Comment,212

James Gosling had a vision for Java, that it would be more advanced than C, but not as complicated as C++. For example, Gosling was against both operator overloading and even unsigned numbers. Verbosity in Java is a feature, because it supposed makes it easier to read.

Java's slow deliberate process was in part due to Sun, a company famous for coming up with pretty good ideas too early and with extremely poor execution. 

And also due to the fact that Java's language designers are extremely reluctant to significantly change the language such that old code cannot be compiled with new code. 

That's why Java went with erasures instead of reified generics like .NET, because they did not want to fork the collection library. Which means, it is even possible today to write new code with raw collections.

That's also why Java doesn't have a proper function type like C# and instead lambdas are target typed. It means that you can pass lambdas to ancient libraries like Swing, and Swing is none-the-wiser.

Many wrong decisions hurt the language adoption when it had a chance to become popular. Compared to modern languages (Rust, Kotlin, Elixir, and many others), there's no area where D shines.

6580,"When it was first launched there was mild interest from the Ruby community but the developers seemed to resent that or something so they never encouraged it and kept going on about how crystal was a new language and not ""ruby with types"".  As time went on they kept making changes to the language which were incompatible with ruby so that nothing but the most trivial ruby program could compile.  Seems like they could have had a polyfill type of project but alas it wasn't to be.

These days there seems to be no interest from the ruby community. The fact that Stripe spent thousands of man hours writing sorbet instead of working on Crystal or porting to crystal tells you everything you need to know. Same goes for RBS. 

Crystal devs could have and should have worked closely with the ruby community but they chose a different way and now the language languishes with a very small community and ecosystem.

As for macros they are needed to make up for the lack of dynamism and they are nice.

In my opinion Crystal should be marketed at the go community these days. It's a better language than go due to macros, polymorphism, generics etc but of course go has such amazing tooling and the compiler is blazing fast so it might be a hard sell.

6621,"Have dealt with similar attacks years ago. You're right inasmuch as you can create rules to filter requests, but that's only a part of the solution, and how much you can actually do about it depends on how much authority you have.

The internet as it is, being a global cyclic graph of hardware and links, means a botnet attack is a swarm of requests all directed toward just one node or a small section of the graph. As such you're only going to be able to control and filter whatever pieces of the network you have direct control over.

At the lowest level you can create the filters on the application itself (i.e. log into WordPress and configure some IP filter), but your servers are still going to be servicing the requests and computing whether or not to accept or reject it. This can result in denial of service and you're often lucky if you're able to log into the application to apply the rules.

If you have a bit more authority, you might have a software or virtual firewall or some proxies &amp; load balancers which can protect your application servers but the network is probably still going to be flooded with traffic, again possibly resulting in denial of service to you and other members of that network (i.e. other customers in the same rack / DC / vlan) if the botnet is too large to handle.

If you own or run a datacentre you may actually have access to the physical network devices, in which case you could configure hardware firewalls, but even then a large enough attack will cause issues, it then comes down to the capacity of whatever internet backbone(s) your DC is sitting on top of, and they might just decide to switch your services off if it becomes a problem for their other customers.

If you're a telco then you have authority over the broader distribution hubs / long-haul backbones etc, so you could make broader changes across a larger portion of the internet to spread the load out.

There are global initiatives to track and filter botnets as they appear and modern infra has tools to detect, filter, and share configuration related to potential threats in realtime. Plenty of firewalls these days can be set up to use these services so a lot of the filtering is spread out across the entire globe.

But even then, a new attack from a new botnet can launch instantly, and it takes a while for it to be identified and filtered, and if various systems are struggling, they may not be getting the required updates quickly enough to start filtering. It's a bit of a cat and mouse game.

&gt;""**Malbolge**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Malbolge (named after the 8th circle of Hell) was designed to be the most difficult and esoteric programming language. Among other features, code is self-modifying by design and the effect of an instruction depends on its address in memory.  
&gt;  
&gt;\---------  
  
**Piet**  
  
Piet program that prints 'Piet'  
  
A ""Hello World"" program in Piet  
Piet is a language designed by David Morgan-Mar, whose programs are bitmaps that look like abstract art.\[12\] The execution is guided by a ""pointer"" that moves around the image, from one continuous coloured region to the next. Procedures are carried out when the pointer exits a region.  
  
There are 20 colours for which behaviour is specified: 18 ""colourful"" colours, which are ordered by a 6-step hue cycle and a 3-step brightness cycle; and black and white, which are not ordered. When exiting a ""colourful"" colour and entering another one, the performed procedure is determined by the number of steps of change in hue and brightness. Black cannot be entered; when the pointer tries to enter a black region, the rules of choosing the next block are changed instead. If all possible rules are tried, the program terminates. Regions outside the borders of the image are also treated as black. White does not perform operations, but allows the pointer to ""pass through"". The behaviour of colours other than the 20 specified is left to the compiler or interpreter.  
  
Variables are stored in memory as signed integers in a single stack. Most specified procedures deal with operations on that stack, while others deal with input/output and with the rules by which the compilation pointer moves.  
  
Piet was named after the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.\[13\] The originally intended name, Mondrian, was already taken by an open-source statistical data-visualization system.""",1649362168,programming,Tao_Dragon,programming,Comment,314

Requiring all members be initialized is a side-effect of trying to avoid bugs related to uninitialized members.

Odin/Go/Rust (the pattern looks similar, but I have not used it) have more language complexity for copying and manipulating members on a structural level, but this behavior is not a strike against classes as a whole, but instead classes as they stand in common languages today.

What you seem to be arguing for is the idea of composition over inheritance, which is relying on language-level features like `using`, etc., and could be implemented in a language that prefers the term class and allows member methods -- for example, I could write a code generator for C# to automatically add properties to forward between Rectangle and Point/Size with a `[Using]` attribute and a constructor to initialize those fields, and even implicit conversion operators; the final source would end up looking something like this:

    class Point { int x; int y; }
    class Size { int w; int h; }
    partial class Rectangle { [Using] Point point; [Using] Size size; }

    var r = new Rectangle();

There are languages that implement message-passing concurrency as libraries and do it well. D, mentioned prior, has std.concurrency for this. But again, refer to the first paragraph.

There's also a few benefits, such as catching more concurrency mistakes at compile time, slightly better optimisation, scheduler is shipped in the runtime &amp; within the program, thread memory is allocated/deallocated quickly.

6789,"Lets talk about how modern cyber-attacks work nowadays.

Nowadays you do multiple attacks trying to do various actions. This can be as simple a DDOS where so many people talk to a server at once that the server cannot do anything else. Sometimes you want to do that to distract security, make systems go into fallbacks, etc. Similarly some attacks are done by hijacking democratic systems, where if enough computers claim something, it's believed as true (because computers choose to believe what most other computers claim they see, they can't all be wrong), and a few other subtle tricks. You also still want access to key machines that are able to do something for you.

This requires computing power, and a lot of computers. This is hard, even as a state people can quickly track down what machine you are, and control you.

So what you do is you start a computer virus. When a victim opens a file (sometimes just looks at a picture), runs some program (that has the virus hidden) or sometimes they do nothing (and the virus is injected from outside by someone else) they have this virus piece of code added to their machine. The virus will then try to spread itself to other machines as much as possible, repeating the process. All the infected computers become something called a ""bot-net"". The bot-net has a special server, lets call it the ""hive-mind"" that can send orders to any machine, and the virus will do what its asked. This lets whomever controls the hive-mind control the full botnet, making it do what it wants. Think of every infected machine as a sleeper agent, and the hive-mind as the way you send orders.

The bot-net is pretty smart, it can realize that it's on a special computer that has permissions that are interesting for the manager of the network. At the very least it reports the machines its got to the botnet's managers who can then realize this, and send commands to handle that computer as special. That way botnets can also gain control of computers that have special permissions to do a lot of things.

This takes months, if not years, to set up. And Russia has been setting one up for a while. It's gotten access to key computers that means this botnet has the power to cause huge damage to our electric grid, water system, and other important services that you'd never think have a computer that is indirectly connected to the internet.

The US govt, knowing that Russia would probably attempt cyber attacks in response to the economic sanctions due to Ukraine, decided to investigate what vulnerabilities existed. They found this virus in machines, and realized that Russia could use it (and probably would). So they went trying to make it unable.

Now the virus on itself is pretty harmless, as long as it hasn't gotten any orders from its hivemind. So the solution is to get rid of the hive-mind. If you search you can find out what is the ""name"" for the hive-mind (sometimes a url, sometimes a raw IP) the point is, you can always change what a name points to within a part of the network as long as everyone agrees. So if every ISP, network provider, etc. in the US overrides this name to whatever you want (say by making it an order from the president for national security reasons) then you would have replaced the hive-mind. The easiest thing is to simply never have it point anywhere, as if thought there was no hive-mind.

That is what the US government did. So now without hive-mind the infected machines of the botnet can't receive orders and therefore can't attack the US. I assume (though the article doesn't make it clear) that the US also did as much as they could removing the virus (in case that there's a way for the hivemind to talk with the bots that they didn't realize and remove) in critical infrastructure machines, basically getting rid of moles, just in case.",1649352520,programming,lookmeat,programming,Comment,677

6797,"C++ is such an incredibly complex and nuanced language that I don't believe anyone can truly master it.  A developer can become reasonably proficient and reasonably efficient with the language but, more so than most other languages, no matter how much you know, there will be more about C++ to learn.

I've been coding in C++ for years (also done my fair share of ANSI-C, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Verilog, and assembly) and I'm still constantly discovering new things about the language.

I do believe there is value in learning C++ and I do believe C++ does offer unique utility just as there is value in learning and unique utility in Python, RUST, ANSI-C, assembly, etc.  With that said, if you want to understand the fundamentals of how systems work, you're probably much better off mastering ANSI-C (and maybe some assembly) than attempting to master C++.

Heck, if you really want to understand, in gory details how these systems actually work, you're probably better of learning Verilog or VHDL over C++ as those will teach you how the processors and associated peripherals are actually developed.",1649352155,programming,tuxidriver,programming,Comment,184

In practice async/await is very similar to green threads (virtual threads) they effectively accomplish the same underlying goal but the issue with async/await is that well... once you start using them it pollutes pretty much everything it touches (very notable in Javascript / Typescript).

Virtual threads are a bit more convenient because you don't turn the entire codebase upside down when you need to start to use them (especially if as far as I understand it, you just allocate a virtual thread pool which runs your virtual threads).

In a world where 100% of the code running is managed code under the runtime (CLR or JVM), it's basically the perfect solution.  But the argument is that you're almost never in a case where 100% of relevant code is managed -- you might be relying on OS-provided thread-local storage, or calling to unmanaged libraries that have thread affinity and/or can't or don't provide asynchronous alternatives to blocking operations.   Unless the runtime is going to guarantee your virtual thread will be *continuing* on the same OS thread it was on before it was interrupted (and that's a promise that can't be made efficiently) then you're rolling the dice that anything unmanaged you use might not play well when it starts getting called from multiple threads from a threadpool.

It also yoinks away some of the control the developer has over concurrency.  In .NET in a single-threaded SynchronizationContext (e.g. the UI threads of WinForms, WPF, etc.), you *know* for a 100% fact that no code will be running in context out of the current execution fiber unless you use the `await` keyword somewhere.  You can avoid having to lock *everywhere* when you know that the fiber itself has inherent locking characteristics that are ultimately under the final control of the end developer.

In a world where it seems like the goal is that *any* blocking IO can be automatically changed into a fiber transition, you no longer have that control.  Any arbitrary method you call to might do IO internally somewhere down its callstack and all of a sudden you have concurrency happening.   Basically, you're back to the situation where you have to code defensively everywhere like you're in a free-threaded model -- and that kinda sucks.",1649350471,programming,drysart,programming,Comment,302

In programming, an edge case typically involves input values that require special handling in an algorithm behind a computer program. As a measure for validating the behavior of computer programs in such cases, unit tests are usually created; they are testing boundary conditions of an algorithm, function or method. A series of edge cases around each ""boundary"" can be used to give reasonable coverage and confidence using the assumption that if it behaves correctly at the edges, it should behave everywhere else.[1]

For example, a function that divides two numbers might be tested using both very large and very small numbers. This assumes that if it works for both ends of the magnitude spectrum, it should work correctly in between.[2]",1649344711,programming,Nervous_Fix7426,programming,Comment,123

7010,"It's an interesting discussion even if the conclusion is that mapping between two languages is not as simple as transforming an AST. This reminds me of some history! As you might know Lisp's parend-laden syntax is essentially a textual encoding for ASTs. The syntax is referred to as S-expressions. In John McCarthy's first paper on Lisp he introduced S-expressions, and he also proposed M-expressions which would be a more user friendly syntax. The idea was that people would read and write M-expressions, and those would be converted to S-expressions behind the scenes. But as time went on people got used to S-expressions. Work on M-expressions fell by the wayside and was never finished.

I read somewhere an idea that if M-expressions caught on people might have different syntax preferences, and each programmer could view code in their preferred variation of M-expressions. Your editor could be configured to display a file of S-expressions as though it were written in your configured M-expressions syntax, and automatically convert back and forth. In principal this is possible with any language - we have automatic code formatters that kinda convert your code to an AST and back to human-readable form whenever you run them. That idea could be taken further where your editor displays code according to your own style preferences, and automatically converts to some agreed-upon formatting convention when writing to disk. For example when writing TypeScript you wouldn't have to get consensus from your team on whether to use semicolons - that could be a display preference in your editor.",1649339803,programming,hallettj,programming,Comment,257

Classes were the answer to that problem. Restrict the code that can access the members and they can insure that such relationships and invariants are enforced.

7062,"&gt; Green threads are preemptively multitasked and provide parallelism; that means you'll still have to worry about data races and such. (Note that when working with cooperative multitasking such as coroutines, you'll only have to worry about race conditions, but not data races.)

Java cannot support this completely, because being truly preemptive requires you to have control over the thread all the time, something the Java scheduler won‚Äôt be able to offer. For example, if a Java Virtual Thread is stuck in an infinite loop(for example calling a C library), there's no way to pass the control over that thread back to the scheduler. Then you claim that Kotlin has in fact parallel Coroutines, so It just supports what I'm saying.

&gt; Not a single one of these languages brings parallelism with their implementations of coroutines by default

And how exactly is that relevant to my thesis?

&gt; Go, which has Goroutines (which are explicitly NOT the same as coroutines)

Wikipedia lists Go with native support for Coroutines, your linked post starts with IMO and If you take the abstract definition of Coroutines It applies to Go! So It's a discussion of definition but as I said the core problem is how Java people implement 100 new terms instead of discussing the abstract ideas of stackful/stackless coroutines and implicit/explicit async/await.

The value of computer generated images is likely to be low, buyers purchase paintings from artists with reputation typically for a higher value and when said individual does eventually pass that value converts into an investment since the pieces are now rare.

You have other issues to solve too, converting the medium from a digital format to a physical format. A lot of the ""good"" paintings aren't just flat prints, the paint is lifted and effectively sculped onto the canvas so it has texture and is almost like a miniature 3D scene.

Internally, it's all just an internal function call. There's still value in a `foreach` statement even if, internally, it compiles to the equivalent of `for (int i=0; i&lt;object.length; i++)`.

In this case, there's a large difference (I think, not too sure, welcome to corrections).

The C# `Task.Run(Func)` has implications for the caller (caller sync/async policy must match the callee sync/async policy).

As a first-class keyword, the compiler can determine the policy itself at runtime and not need the programmer to manually fix red/blue and blue/red mismatches all over their code.

As a library, the compiler may not make any assumptions about what an instance of a Task can do when the compiler is compiling the caller; after all, the underlying `Task` type can be swapped out **at runtime** for an instance of a different class that matches the interface (any time dependency injection occurs, for example) but has different behaviour.

7086,"&gt; a QBasic version looks something like this:

    1 SCREEN 12 #enter SCREEN 12 mode, 640x480 with 16 colors
    5 COLOR INT(RND * 15) #randomly choose one of 16 colors (starts at 0)
   10 PRINT ‚ÄúHELLO WORLD‚Äù; #Print Hello World but without end of line, remove ; for EOL 
   20 GOTO 5 # Go back to position 5 and repeat

Well, not really. Firstly, I'm not sure if you intend this to be QBasic-compatible or exclusively for QB64, but QBasic didn't use '#' as a comment character; the single-quote character was used (as in Visual Basic to this day). I'll ignore the ""smart-quotes"" as a mere formatting issue that isn't visible in the font used on the site anyway. Secondly, and more importantly, line-numbers were essentially a deprecated feature by the time of QBasic and are most certainly a ""legacy"" thing in QB64. Actual named, re-entrant subroutines and functions and if you must use GOTO, named labels, were the order of the day.

A more idiomatic and valid (untested) version of that code would be:

    start: 'Label for GOTO
    SCREEN 12 'enter SCREEN 12 mode, 640x480 with 16 colors
    COLOR INT(RND * 15) 'randomly choose one of 16 colors (starts at 0)
    PRINT ""HELLO WORLD""; 'Print Hello World but without end of line, remove ; for EOL 
    GOTO start ' Go back to the start and repeat

A better idea would be to use an actual loop rather than GOTO.

&gt; Later, its descendants in form of Visual Basic are still used in programing language for macros in all Microsoft products like Excel, Word, or Windows in general with Visual Basic Script. There is little left of BASIC in them except for the name.

Visual Basic for Applications (the macro language in Office) is a direct descendant of Q(uick)Basic. It's literally using the old Visual Basic engine; which originated as a re-write of the QBasic engine (which was largely written in assembly and was based on GWBASIC and BASIC-86, dating right back to 1979) into C for Windows with the addition of the Forms system. Apart from things like graphics and console I/O, most QBasic code will work just fine in VB(A). VBScript is little different, but the language is still very closely related.

As a slight aside, does anybody know anything about the short-lived Macintosh version of QuickBasic? Obviously it can't be using the same x86 assembly-based runtime, since the Mac's Motorola 68000 is entirely incompatible. The only other reference to a Microsoft BASIC product for the 68000 I can find is AmigaBASIC, so perhaps that is related?

So if you don't do exactly what they would have done in the way they would have done it, you have failed to meet their standard and you will never live up to it.

7146,"Up to a limit.

Some ideas are good to a point, but if you take them too far, they start to have more cost than benefit.

There's such a thing as a system that is overly complex but achieves very little. And, which has a corresponding much simpler system that achieves way more.

To nit pick on the article, python classes are not actually a useful way to organize code. Python already has modules and namespaces which serve that purpose.

Structs are much simpler than classes and also more powerful.

Not just in terms of performance (contiguous memory, ability to live on the stack and be passed by value, and embed other structs by value, etc), but also in terms of programming convenience.

I'll use Odin and Go's conception of a struct instead of C (C is a bit lacking).

- You can trivially create an instance of a struct without needing to call a function or assign values to all members. Compare to classes in Typescript: when you declare a class member, you must initialize it in the constructor or provide it a default value (which is just syntax sugar for initializing it in the constructor).

- Embedding structs lets you mass-assign multiple fields by mere assignment.

Consider this snippet in Odin (Go has identical feature but the syntax is different).

    Point :: struct {
        x: int,
        y: int,
    }

    Size :: struct {
        w: int,
        h: int,
    }

    Rect :: struct {
        using point: Point,
        using size: Size,
    }


Usage:

    // create instance
    r: Rect

    // You can assign to individual fields exactly as if Rect was defined
    // as { x: int, y: int, w: int, h: int }
    r.x = 10;
    r.y = 20;

    // Or you can assign point and size from different places
    // assume this point is already defined somewhere
    p := Point { x = 100, y = 120 }

    // no need to manually copy individual fields
    r.point = p
    r.size = compute_size(some_params)

    // I can pass the `point` of the rect to functions that take a point without
    // needing to create a temporary point object that copies the (x,y) values 
    // from `r`
    proc_that_takes_point(r.point)
    proc_that_takes_size(r.size)
    
This is more powerful than Classes, and yet in terms of complexity of language, it is actually simpler.",1649322579,programming,wisam910,programming,Comment,384

            return TagBadge.objects.filter(awarded_to_user=user,badge_type=badge_type, tag_name=tag_name,bade_position=""BADGE"")

Thus the complexity is regulated only by code, which often requires you to know a lot about conventional approaches to various things in Lisp to be able to understand existing code or write new code that runs efficiently.

The flaw the author's central argument is that the degree to which a programming language is complicated doesn't necessarily reflect the extent to which it uses syntax and language features to reduce cognitive load on programmers, and in many cases adds it because language features can interact in weird ways.

When using OpenZiti, every endpoint (SDK for in-app access, tunnelers for the operating system or edge routers for the network) must have an identity with provisioned certificates. The certificates allow Ziti to perform authentication and authorization before any data flows across secure communications channels. These endpoints reach out of the private network to talk to the controller (control plane) and make connections to join the network fabric mesh (data plane). Therefore, services and endpoints in your private networks only make outbound connections‚Äîand thus, no holes are opened for inbound traffic.*",1649316721,programming,PhilipLGriffiths88,programming,Comment,130

7223,"Well, it certainly is a more complex setup. It can feel quite daunting for new hires, especially those less familiar with Rust, to have this complex machinery going on inside the reducers. And it‚Äôs extra confusing that some of our reducers are in Rust, but not all. That‚Äôs something we have to deal with and consider with onboarding. Fortunately our TypeScript developers seem quite eager to learn Rust, which we obviously encourage.

But from an architectural perspective, I really like Redux because it makes state management (a hard problem, especially with the complexity involved inside our reducers) traceable and easily testable thanks to its use of pure functions. But to me, Redux always felt hamstrung due to the limitations of TypeScript. Redux relies on immutable data structures, but TypeScript gives no reliable tools to enforce that. By writing reducers in Rust we can rely much more on the compiler to enforce architectural concerns for us. I feel if we had to scale to this level of complexity with TypeScript alone we might find ourselves in an even tougher spot.

So yeah, I think doing reducers in Rust is something we will be doing for the long haul. But we are interested in doing more (though not all) of the UI in Rust as well. I doubt that‚Äôll make the architecture any easier, but it could be useful to us for performance and/or portability reasons.

If you  can estimate those things you can work out the cross over point where the net benefit kicks in and then use that to prioritize against other work in flight.

Tech debt is notoriously nebulous in its cost. ""Things taking longer than they should"" because of poor documentation, flakey tests, badly refactored code, or slow build pipelines, etc. can be hard to quantity - but can be addressed if you list out all the steps involved and plot a minimal delivery path from a-to-b and then identify the worst bottlenecks.

7232,"The advantage ST has over other OOP languages in my view is something  not often discussed. It may be hard to realize  this advantage even if you know  both ST and other OOP languages.  It is subtle:

In Smalltalk there are no public data-fields.  In other languages there are, you can assign properties to object-instances.  Think of JavaScript where you typically assign data to data-structures all the time.

This means that in Smalltalk if you want to change the state of an object you can do that only from within a method of that same object.  Nobody from the outside of an object can change its state. That means you can easily observe all state-changes by putting log-statements or halts into methods that modify state. 

You can put assertions into those methods that ensure only allowed state-changes are possible and only proper type of data can be stored into an object. This goes beyond most static type-systems. For instance you could ensure that only numbers divisible by 3 can be stored into a slot.  Or only numbers which are bigger than the current value.  Or that x + y + z &lt;=   
1  (how would you express that as a ""type""?) 

The big advantage of objects over functions is that objects support mutable state.  It makes algorithms simple when  you can modify the state easily when needed. But downside of that is it becomes hard to understand how the state of your program changes during its execution. But Smalltalk has the solution:  state is localized to ""instance variables"" of individual object-instances and it becomes possible to ensure the correctness of the total state of each instance.  

You can simulate this feature in other languages by making all data-fields private, but in practice it is too easy to not follow that approach consistently.  In Smalltalk it is the only way. Only private data-fields are allowed.  In the end it means it becomes easier to understand the state-behavior of your program.",1649314160,programming,stronghup,programming,Comment,329

I still like Go, but I think it throws away the wrong bits. Lisp is arguably simpler than Go but it feels much less clunky. Go's first-class concurrency is nice, but I prefer the consistency and immutability offered by functional languages like Erlang for those sorts of things.

7343,"So for the record I largely agree and maybe could phrased it better, I don't think it's a rampant problem so much as a potential one that's a consequence of the overall flexibility of the language.  I've never encountered a problem with multiple inheritance in the wild (much shorter resume in my case though), but it's one of those things that could technically occur and the compiler would gladly accept.  I kind of view it similarly to undefined behavior abuse with C, yeah it technically can occur but it's not something any sane person is going to write in the first place.  Same goes with a lot of other criticisms of the language that whole abstractoryFactoryBean stuff isn't something that really occurs in the wild with any frequency from what I've seen but people still parrot it.

Largely agree with the rest too, C++ tends to have a domain of large complex applications where it's features tend to shine.  So you're going to see design problems associated more with that than anything that's specifically the fault of the language most of the time.

I've always viewed C++ as the analogy of a swiss army knife or a multitool, you can do anything with it but it's not necessarily going to be easy and if you just need a knife it's probably not the most efficient tool for the job.",1649298382,programming,ObservationalHumor,programming,Comment,229

That is, until I saw a combination decompilation/analysis of an object-oriented program. By reading the generated assembly code, I realized that the entire process is just passing a pointer to a set of subroutines.  The class is the code plus the definition of how memory is to be laid out, an object is an actual block of memory that's been allocated and perhaps populated with default values, and calling a method is jumping to a subroutine, passing it a pointer to the correct block of RAM.  

In my case, the complex languages made the concept kind of impenetrable, where all the definitions were circular and dependent on other definitions, but the simplest possible language made it clear after just a few minutes of study.

7356,"I've found debugging Haskell programs to be a nightmare. One huge difference between Haskell (and probably most characteristic to Haskell) and ordinary imperative programs is laziness. I've found laziness makes it sometimes hard to figure out why a particular function wasn't executed, or what seems like straightforward iteration turns into an infinite loop (an [experience](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2007-March/019184.html) I had trying to generate `n` random numbers). Or, if you're not careful with how you do recursion, laziness can result a buildup of unevaluated thunks and thus really inefficient memory usage. So, with some [analysis of memory usage](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html), strictness can be introduced to tactically force evaluation.

Using an encryption library is straightforward and simple, plenty of frameworks have some form of integration to ease it even more.

As long as secrets aren't being stored in plaintext in the VCS, the solution surrounding it isn't all that important.

This is why I listed for Vault though, get a short-lived token to allow your tests and services to access it; harness or app loads from Vault and off you go but that's logistically quite a bit more complex to setup.

That's unfortunate, because using the reference counted types work with the borrow checker, not against it.

Since ""just rewrite the whole thing from scratch"" is a death sentence for any sizable project, the solution was to move as many parts as possible into back-end web services, implemented mostly in C++, and try to starve the Python so there was less of it that needed to be scaled by brute force.

That said, of course I disagree with the parent comment that implied Python has almost no valid use cases.  That's ridiculous.

Well, yeah, Python is a Dynamically typed language. The best you'll (reasonably) get is `type hinting`. But if you're a disciplined developer, you can do really well with this.

It's actually decent if you write all your own code and only use Pyright (which is a very good Python static type checker) but in reality you will use lots of third party libraries with nonexistent or wrong type annotations, and they probably use MyPy which is not very good and even disagrees with Pyright about some things (because the semantics of Python type annotations are undefined).

Typescript is better in almost every way. If you're considering Python you should slap yourself and consider Typescript instead, in almost every situation. The only exceptions are if there's some library you really need to use, e.g. Pytorch.

7684,"&gt; DuckDuckGo and Bing are not true alternatives ‚Äì they‚Äôre just worse versions of Google.

Quite true. I consistently get worse results when using DDG. I don't even bother with Bing.

HOWEVER had, it also has to be said that I consistently get worse results via Google too
in the last 5 years or so, perhaps even longer; hard to measure.

There are many reasons for that, including smaller reasons. For instance, when you go
back after a search result, you have this ANNOYING pop-up (or rather ""phase-in"") that
appears ""people also searched for theseresults"". This one shows up PRECISELY at the
default mouse position so I accidentally misclick sometimes. EVERY SINGLE TIME I do
that I NEVER watch the new page, and instantly hit the back button - but why does this
anti-feature exist? It gives me NOTHING useful, it WASTES my time. It can be blocked
of course (ublock origin and other hero blockers), but why is that even a thing? And
that is just one of many other reasons why Google search results became worse. 

Google became an ad company many years ago already; it is no longer a tech 
company. As a result the Google we now have is a garbage one compared to when
Google was not yet an ad company. So searching for stuff is so much worse via 
Google. This may have been one reason why StackOverflow became popular -
because of Google declining in quality.

Not all of this is Google's fault per se. The whole world wide web transitioned into
a ""gated community"". On instagram you have to ""log in"" to watch videos; you rarely
have to do that on youtube. Twitter pesters you to log in. Facebook as well. Medium.com
has this pop-up. Almost every news article has a ""pay to view"" model. And so on and
so forth. Tons of things that modified the vision for the world wide web to become 
factually worse, so of course the quality decreased. One of the few exceptions to
this is wikipedia; wikipedia has a fairly high quality, give or take (depends on the
article and people writing it, but by and large I think wikipedia has a fairly ok-ish
quality).

Note that I disagree with the article though. I don't want tons of super features and
a gazillion options. I literally never use Google's advanced search either; I just
don't want to. I want it to remain simple at all times. I want to search, and the
results should be good. (Sometimes I enclose search words via """" but Google
also made this worse, by showing me crap rather than ""could not find these
terms. I have no idea why Google is killing Google - other than the search engine
I don't need anything from Google really. There are even alternatives to youtube,
so I am almost living a google-free life already.)",1649268634,programming,shevy-ruby,programming,Comment,481

The worse the code gets the more demoralized the people also get and start to work even slower, get demotivated and in the end quit. So talent retention is something that should be included in this.

  
This just happened to me. We got asked to shove a feature that was ""really really"" needed by the end of the month and a lot of bad code had to be written to comply with that timeline.  
After the complaints started about the tech debt the management said exactly that. ""We will do it later...."".  
2y after and with many different developers adding many new features to the work done, the work had become so bad (you are writing bad code and you know it but you cannot do anything about it), that a lot of developers left, but I had faith (lol naive), so I kept going and tried to convince management...  
Yeah my last day there is tomorrow and I am the last UI dev working on that team and the devs from other teams now say they will quit if they are put working on it.

There are, of course, performance gains to be had by making a language which is specifically built for your problem domain rather than a general purpose language. But they are small and, in practice, tend not to matter as much as easier optimizations like good algorithm design or selecting a library that solves your problem and is well-suited to your use case.

On the flip side though, if you enjoy shaving yaks, then yak shaving is time well spent.

While a hypothesis, assuming quadratic growth does seem reasonable.

For people that question whether a quadratic is correct, perhaps a slightly modified approach would be to write a script that checks out a handful of past versions of your code base, measure line counts for that code, and then push the line counts and commit dates into a spreadsheet.  Once there, find a regression (linear, exponential, cubic, etc.) with the best R\^2 fit to the measured data.

I was processing and rendering the results on instantdomainsearch.com, and on each key stroke it was spending quite a bit of time collecting. It actually got worse as you searched with no page reload, but it was barely perceptible. While other performance issues were more concerning, I was surprised by how high GC was registering in profiles.

I was able to find some spots where we were a little careless and reduce some reliance on needlessly expensive FP patterns, but today the GC is still pretty active on that site compared to where I‚Äôd like it to be. That thing kind of became my baby and there are still a lot of performance improvements I‚Äôd like to make.

We wanted to use rust in the client to make it so our types and data structures could be shared across the stack, but yeah, that bottleneck really is hard to contend with.

Running tests locally, just configured env var on local machine and never worry about it again.

Running tests in CI/CD, use whatever secrets manager (most support env params) is available and set it there and pass it into the test harness.

Alternatively, spin up a Vault server for development that is deployed somewhere the test harness can access and store secrets there.

Since we are talking about GitHub... you have access to GitHub Actions which has a secrets manager which can set secrets as env vars and you can just run the tests as a GitHub Action.

7933,"The point is to make it impossible to concurrently modify values in a way that breaks invariants (e.g. adding an item to a collection without updating the length parameter), but to allow concurrent modification where it is benign. 

Say you have a class like this (contrived to prove the point):

    class Contrived {
        private int[] arr1
        private float[] arr2;
        private int maxIndex1;
        private int maxIndex2;
    }

You want to allow users to add or remove elements from the end of the two arrays, but maintaing the invariant that for each array maxIndexN is the index of the last actually filled in element in arrN.

With Rust-style Mutexes, you would do something like this:

    class intArr {
        private int[] arr;
        private int maxIndex;
    }
    class floatArr{
        private float[] arr;
        private int maxIndex;
    }        
    class Contrived {
        private Mutex&lt;intArr&gt; arr1;
        private Mutex&lt;floatArr&gt; arr2;
        public addToArr1(int item) {
             protectedArr1 = arr1.lock();
             protectedArr1[protectedArr1.maxIndex+1] = item;
             protectedArr1.maxIndex++;
             //unlocked when going out of scope
        }
        public int getArr1Len() {
             return arr1.lock().maxIndex;
        }
        public addToArr2(float item) {
             protectedArr2 = arr2.lock();
             protectedArr2[protectedArr2.maxIndex+1] = item;
             protectedArr2.maxIndex++;
             //unlocked when going out of scope
        }
        public int getArr2Len() {
             return arr2.lock().maxIndex;
        }
    }

This way you have guarantees from the compiler that you can't accidentally modify arr1 or arr2 without taking the lock, but you are also allowed to execute addToArr1 and addToArr2 in parallel.

With actual Java APIs, to get the equivalent protection, you would do something like:

    class intArr {
         private int[] arr;
         private int maxIndex;
         public synchronized void addToArr(int item) {
              arr[maxIndex+1] = item;
              maxIndex++;
         }
         public synchronized int getLen() {
             return maxIndex;
         }
    }    
    class floatArr{
         private float[] arr;
         private int maxIndex;
         public synchronized void addToArr(float item) {
              arr[maxIndex+1] = item;
              maxIndex++;
         }
         public synchronized int getLen() {
             return maxIndex;
         }
    }
    class Contrived {        
        private intArr arr1;
        private floatArr arr2;
        public void addToArr1(int item) {
             arr1.addToArr(item);
        }     
        public int getArr1Len() {
           return arr1.getLen();
        }
        public addToArr2(float item) {
             arr2.addToArr2(item);
        }             
        public int getArr2Len() {
           return arr2.getLen();
        }
    }

In this style, you get more boilerplate, but the implementation of Contrived is assured by the compiler to never be able to break the invariants or intArr and floatArr (and yes, I know I could have created a single generic class, it's just the only example that quickly came to mind).

For example, with Java style locks, you could accidentally write it like this, which can't happen with Rust style locks or Java synchronized classes:

    class Contrived {
        private intArr arr1;
        private floatArr arr2;
        private static final Object arr1Lock = new Object();
        private final Object arr2Lock = new Object();
        public addToArr1(int item) {
             synchronized(arr1Lock) {
                 arr1[arr1.maxIndex+1] = item;
                 arr1.maxIndex++;
             }
        }
        public int getArr1Len() {
             synchronized(arr2Lock) {
                  return arr1.maxIndex;
        }
        public addToArr2(float item) {
             synchronized(arr2) {
                 arr2[arr2.maxIndex+1] = item;
             }
             arr2.maxIndex++;
        }
        public int getArr2Len() {
             return arr2.maxIndex;
        }
    }

As a dumb example, you can have an insert-only set that's technically a CRDT.

Any node can add items to the set. When they have network access, they sync up by unioning all their sets together. It doesn't violate CAP - It allows you to make writes to a data structure even while your network is slow, laggy, or disconnected, but you still won't see writes from other nodes until later.

8001,"&gt; The worlds most complex manufacturing and fabrication happens in China

China is a country that appears competent on the surface, with a nice facade of technological prowess they've developed by stealing everyone else's technology, but China has core competencies that are just completely hallow and superficial.

For example, China still can't produce decent, efficient jet engines. Over half a century after many major countries figured this out, China still can't do reliable, efficient, and original jet engine designs, and can't manufacture them to a high standard even when they're copying other countries' work.

Why? Because their engineers cheated in college, their designs are based on reverse-engineered jet engines from other countries, and they've had to fill in the gaps where information can't be attained through espionage, their production system is unhampered by quality control, their materials are substandard, and nobody has any personal integrity. ""Good enough"" is the MO. The result, from the beginning of development to the time a jet engine leaves an assembly line, there have been multiple points of failure where people's dishonesty and incompetence negatively affected the process somewhere. The whole process of design, development, and production has a high level of complexity that requires everyone to do their job at a high level. When China tries to undertake things like this, eventually their ideological dysfunction and lack of collective and personal integrity in their population sabotages the efforts.",1649213674,programming,brunhilda1,programming,Comment,234

8046,"&gt;There's a reason that development jobs at big tech companies like Reddit are highly competitive to get and pay extremely well.

This is faulty reasoning. Microsoft, also, is a top employer.

Decisions in large organizations are made by humans with bizarre incentives within unhealthy cultures. I absolutely, 0% defer to the assumption that when a large company does something, that this reflects a careful engineering process, rather than someone conforming to the kinds of decisions that culture is set up to produce.

How many versions of the following story have we heard here: ""We wanted to go with Technology A, but since that's not part of our environment already that would require our team get approval for Technology A from management, then get cross-team involvement to have it deployed and managed by Operations, which is a bureaucratic nightmare. So instead, we created a solution by duct-taping together various Technology B components, which we already had lying around and could do without having to go against the culture of the organization.""",1649205965,programming,anechoicmedia,programming,Comment,203

Controversy about needing an account and stuff like that aside. When you run a command, the command and its output is combined into a kind of 'block'. This adds a number of features.

For example you can easily copy the output from that block. Saving the need to use the mouse to drag and select.

What's really cool is you can turn that block into a permalink, that you can then share. I can see that being very useful when debugging a problem with others. I can provide a link to the command I've run, with it's output, in one. Especially if the link has preview support for things like Slack.

It would be nice if I could delete these blocks. i.e. In case I mistyped a command, and just want to clean up my workspace.

Honestly, the command / output as a combined block is a really appealing and unique feature for me. I don't know if it's appealing enough that I'd pay for it. I'd certainly love to see something similar in other terminals.",1649193619,programming,jl2352,programming,Comment,188

8171,"&gt; the fabs themselves don't give two shits about the quality of the output

This is exactly the sort of ridiculous over-generalisation I was talking about in my original comment. There are *some* places that operate like this - these are generally fabs where they ""partner"" with a metric shit-ton of people just trying to get their products made as cheaply as possible. I mean, what do you expect with that?

But that isn't every fabs business model. Seriously, go and read about how proper manufacturing works in China (Andrew Huang has a great blog/books about it).

And another note about QC in general - yes, of course there should be people from the product side involved in the QC coming off the assembly line. They are the ones who know about the product, it's functions, and what it's operational parameters are. Fabs are good at *fabricating* - as the product designer it's your responsibility to come up with a process for QA. That can be someone physically there - on a permanent basis, or just for training. At a minimum it should be a testing manual with a checklist procedure. Even better if you can supply a full test rig - maybe with a bed of nails or something more complicated - and a computer attached where the operator loads the product, presses a button and gets a pass or fail.

I know there is a lot of media out there claiming all kinds of crap, but it's worth taking with a grain of salt, and recognising that your painting a huge number of super smart, dedicated people with a prejudiced brush when you make claims like this.",1649192350,programming,FrancisStokes,programming,Comment,279

The point of programming languages is to enable the programmer to express himself in a way that a programming execution system will execute what he intended. Programming languages may be good or bad depending on how well they serve that purpose. 

It is the job of the compiler to produce accurate and efficient code. It's been a long time since I looked at the code generated by a compiler to decide whether the language that is compiling is valuable. 

There is no point to this melody language if the target audience is people who are regex Pros. I use regex enough to be dangerous but not enough to be skilled at it. I do not consider that regex is in any way a good way of expressing the programmer's intent. While it's possible to figure out what it does, I never considered that any nontrivial regex that I have created is adequately self-documenting for another programmer to understand even if that programmer is My Future self. Melody seems much better in that respect.

Parenthetically, I have noticed a common problem with programmers and with real people is the inability to see the world from anyone else's perspective. I infer from your comment that you are a regex expert who uses regex in JavaScript and that you therefore assume the target audience is regex experts using regex in JavaScript.

8290,"&gt; These should require a warrant to access, as per the 4th amendment.

Despite the headline calling them ""Emergency Search Warrants"", these aren't warrants.

Organizations aren't required to turn over data by an EDR.  On receiving and validating an EDR, IF they choose to turn over data they can do so with a safe harbor provision. Many large companies have a policies to verify then respond immediately.

Organizations are not required to turn it over. It can go through a traditional subpoena path that takes 2-4 weeks to accomplish. However, there's a high chance the data will be irrelevant, and in the case of missing children, a very high chance they're dead by then.

&gt; So when the government wants me to ""think of the children"" to allow another bypass of civil liberties

Again, no, totally different scenario.  That you would equate the two shows a lack of understanding of how the courts work in practice.  

FISA processes take weeks to be granted, and there is time for verification. EDRs are not orders, they can be ignored if they wish.

&gt; That's some crappy due diligence from the most sophisticated tech companies on the planet.

Reverse that. The companies have been asking for a standardized callback method for multiple years.

The only reason this is in the news is because it's been found in the wild and people are being prosecuted for it. The actual vulnerability has been known for more than a decade. The change is an additional requirement at police agencies to both publish and keep current their emergency contact numbers.  While this is done by major cities, it often isn't done for local police and sheriff offices, especially in rural areas.

The attack Krebs described include taking over both email accounts (that can digitally sign messages) and also SIM swapping to get a proper phone number in the department.  They email, fax, and call the seemingly official numbers. The problem is that the seemingly-official numbers aren't authentic because there is no government publication.

Tech companies widely and publicly declare what the law enforcement emergency contact is. For example, Facebook uses [this page](https://www.facebook.com/records/) for police agencies to make emergency contacts and talk to real live people.  You can easily find the information for the other big tech companies.  The reverse is not true. While big cities may have the resources, smaller counties, towns, or individual police departments have no easy way to authenticate the EDR. Many small towns barely have a website.

&gt; Why does a local judge have to be involved?

That's what you called for, a proper warrant, or more properly here, a subpoena. Those are requested by law enforcement or lawyers and then issued by a judge.  Normally the process takes a few weeks.

&gt; Have a state or federal level judge on call specifically for this.

Same problem, now you're moving the location of it.  Ultimately it is the government agencies, not the tech companies, that need to improve their publication of data to make verification possible.",1649181554,programming,rabid_briefcase,programming,Comment,503

There are two kinds of brands: reputation and recognition. Getting a brand just because you recognize it over some random one you don't doesn't really have much value.

We believe that the terminal is more powerful when you can share commands with teammates, generate commands using Open AI Codex, or run shared wikis directly in the terminal. These are not possible if users do not have an account with us. We've already begun building team features and we want to be able to ship them to our users without friction.  


For our public beta, we do send telemetry and we do associate it with the logged in user because it makes it much easier to reach out and get feedback when something goes wrong. But we only track metadata, never console output. For an exhaustive list of events that we track, see here: https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/privacy#exhaustive-telemetry-table.

I don't think I'd use it for anything past a hobby project, but generally if I need to know how to do something, I just have to hunt through the code to see what particularly it's doing, and if I need a small tweak, it's super easy to do so, often inheriting from a the particular class I need, or modifying the class directly (and forgetting to document my changes accordingly; that's shot my feet off a lot).

My main complaint about Smalltalk is that there have been a few different ways to do source control, and it's always difficult for me to get down to what the current standards are.  All I want is to fileout and use git command line on text files (doable, but often isn't standard, unless the community has shifted recently).  There are numerous tools that have been made over the years (even prior to what we know with git) with different incompatible versions that make it difficult to discern the best way forward.

If smalltalk distributions had a much better FFI, I'd likely try to use it in environments for operational tasks, though since trying Erlang (which isn't Smalltalk, in case I might confuse anyone), the concept of just shelling out to an external program that returns json appeals to me more, and I might try doing that instead.

The point is, bot developers would only find out about this after it hit them the first time (again, see assumptions at the start of previous comment).

It is not meant to be reusable.

You don't need an API endpoint with the mapping, you can send it to the clients via the same websocket connection through which they get the canvas updates - as some special kind of command (that only starts being sent out 15 minutes before the planned switch). Obivously you need to have JS code on the client that interprets the command, but as was said in previous comment, that could be reasonably well hidden.

A tip-off is that their Documentation section includes a long list of [academic papers and presentations](https://mercurylang.org/documentation/papers.html). :)

It's an interesting language! If you know Prolog and some Haskell or OCaml, you can make sense of at least half of Mercury. :) One novelty is that you have to be explicit about your ""modes"".  Prolog famously lets you ""run functions backwards"", e.g. the statement `append(A, B, C)` just means ""C is the result of appending list A with list B"". The way you *call* this is up to you, i.e., the output value could be A, or B, or C. Mercury also lets you do this, but forces you to state which modes are possible: e.g. ""A, B are inputs, and C is an output; and you can also have B, C as inputs, and A as an output."" It helps them generate more performant code, among other things.

Having written a little Mercury, unfortunately I feel they lost the immediacy and flexibility of Prolog, by trading for better type safety and performance.

8418,"I am counting on the fact that the bots are not very sophisticated - if they were, they could get past literally anything. I am also counting on the fact that this change would catch them by surprise, because similarly - if they know, they'll just adapt.

So let's say you want to catch bots that either:

- directly send the API requests (e.g. `{x: 100, y: 20, color: 4}`, I don't know what the actual API looks like)
- perform UI actions in browser based on CSS selectors (e.g. click on `#color4`, `.color:nth-child(4)`)

All you need to do is to make your server write `4` to the database when it sees the incoming `color: 4` initially, but later make it write e.g. `7`, for all requests with `color: 4` arriving after some pre-determined point in time.

To make this only affect bots and not humans:

- Have the client JS contain functionality that will perform a matching change in the UI to adapt to the new color mapping - e.g. if before clicking on red would have sent `4`, after the JS makes the change, clicking on red will send e.g. `2` - which is the ""new red"", that used to be some other color before. 
- Similarly, change the UI elements (color buttons) to match (so `#color2` will now be the red button instead of `#color4`), and reorder them with some CSS fuckery, so everything looks the same as before.
- Client's clocks can be inaccurate, but it's easy to detect that and compensate for it - especially since a client is only allowed one write every 5 minutes.
- The time and new mapping can be either hard-coded or received from the server a sufficient time before the switch. Obviously reading the JS would give this away, but I don't think the average bot dev would try to look for such things in obfuscated code - see the initial assumptions at the start of this comment. Most would probably just look at the network traffic. It can be well hidden in code with a little bit of creativity (e.g. pretend it's part of a library).",1649174610,programming,EnvironmentalCrow5,programming,Comment,358

8453,"&gt; What does this have to do with constitutional law?

A lot. Private data like emails and personal files are held in the cloud. These should require a warrant to access, as per the 4th amendment.

&gt; This has nothing to do with foreign intelligence surveillance, either. This is about Emergency Data Requests or EDRs, usually used for missing persons.

The government showed it could not be trusted with this kind of program. FISA was justified as needed to fight terrorism, but there was very little oversight. The program was [rampantly abused ](https://cdt.org/insights/fisa-court-opinion-outlines-fbi-abuse-of-key-intelligence-surveillance-authority/) by the FBI for years and all that happened was an angry letter from the court. There were no consequences for anyone involved, and surely it's all still happening. So when the government wants me to ""think of the children"" to allow another bypass of civil liberties, I'll tell them to fuck off. Especially if we're taking something that even the FBI abused and giving similar power to every local deputy and therefore trusting every local sheriff's office's IT department.

&gt; Both the laws I've read that provide safe harbor, and the policies I've read from companies, all require due diligence from those giving information. 

&gt; Recall that in the attack, criminals are exploiting official credentials from official organizations. When the company calls the official-looking hacked phone number, they get the criminals who tell them it is legit. Organizations are doing what they can to verify the emergency aspect, the criminals are forging, intercepting, and otherwise doing criminal acts to appear legitimate.

That's some crappy due diligence from the most sophisticated tech companies on the planet. It's like they don't care. If you get a call from your bank asking for personal information, are you going to trust caller ID? You're going to hang up or, at best, call them back at a number you can verify. How hard would it be for an ISP to call back the local law enforcement office at a publicly published number and ask for the person making the request? It's easy, assuming you care.

&gt; These are often local emergency issues. About 80% of the area of the country is rural. We can't all live in cities with 24/7 services. In rural areas the county judge might be available just one day a week, sometimes even less often. Cell service exists in town and near major roads, but out in the fields, farms, forests, and deserts where judges are working for their main job, cell service doesn't exist at all.

Why does a local judge have to be involved? These are requests to national companies anyway. Have a state or federal level judge on call specifically for this. Then have a dedicated office whose job it is to verify everything, get the request signed by a judge, and liaise with the service provider on a verified way.",1649172449,programming,oren0,programming,Comment,477

Icing on the cake: ""these things have electrolytic capacitors!"". A bog-standard no-name electrolytic cap is going to have a temperature rating of -40C to 105C, and if your USB hub is boiling your tea, you have more problems than whether the lifespan of your capacitors is being cut short.

This guy cuts open some bargain-basement OEM electronics, googles up some part numbers, and now he has deep insight into the state of the USB-C hub industry today? Sorry, not buying it.

My guesses for this change are: bandwidth is not an issue because the CDN usage, it makes harder to scrap data (you need to process the images instead of just getting the coordinates), is easier to implement the client side (which makes sense looking the 2017, they can just use drawImage for every single update) and it makes batching easier (if the server overloads just stop sending updates for a while then send all the changes all in once in a single image, at this point the PNG compression would work better).

8697,"&gt; I am in no way trolling.

Apologies then, your username threw me off

&gt; Your vector code is slower, less safe, harder to use than a std::vector.

I disagree somewhat:

1. My initial benchmarks (when the vector/array size-increment was a  multiple of 2) had my array slightly faster on insertion, iteration and removal. I've since simplified it because I felt that the complications introduced by optimising for removal and insertion outweighed the advantages in performance. Now it is only slightly faster on iteration.

2. Safety - certainly you have a point - it's all void pointers. However, I've got a (unpublished) wrapper for the `libds` library that uses preprocessor macros to generate static and inlined function calls with the correct types in the parameters for each type that is declared using the preprocessor macro. If you try to add a `char *` to a `dsarray` that is declared to take `struct foo *`, it will fail to compile.

3. Harder to use? Subjective I think. 

&gt; You can use any subset of C++ you want - I‚Äôm sure you can find various things useful if you 

I do use it (work purpose), and I do see value in things that come for free in C++. However, having used it daily makes me loathe maintaining it. I can go back to a C project I did 3 years ago and quickly get going again due to the absolute simplicity and explictness of the language.

When I go back 3 years to pick up a C++ project again, it takes longer, especially if others have worked on it in the meantime.

It is not a question of skill, it's the fact that the language is so damn large and unwieldy that someone is is considered one of the foremost experts in the language [left it for 2.5 years and now does not trust himself to visually inspect code](https://steven.brokaw.org/posts/scott-meyers-cant-remember-cpp-intricacies).

&gt; if you actually spend some time to learn the language! 

Trust me, the only people who prefer something other than C++ are those with waaaaaay too much knowledge of the language.

TBH, if a project I am doing needs more than C can provide (fairly true, fairly often), I don't reach for C++ as a replacement. I'd use almost anything else (Java, C#).

Literally the only place I'd use C++ is in a medium-to-large game where the ability to namespace effectively helps, and ted for performance is paramount. For everything else I'd use Java or C#.

From the basics, ""At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. "" - there is no adjustment that I see. you waste a lot of time because your company is NOT agile.

Let me explain. From the terms that you are using, I can safely assume that you are (supposedly) using Scrum framework, right?

&gt; Now mind you, I do not work exclusively on one project

Problem number one - Scrum is a product framework. Single dev team, single PO, single SM. If you have multiple projects (as in - you are multiple teams, requiring being in all of them) then you are not doing as Scrum suggests, not to mention this is ineffective in agile sense. After all, team ""It is a *cohesive* unit of professionals focused on *one objective at a time*, the Product Goal.""

&gt; One project already managed to plan two planning and refinement sessions per week. So even if I was just assigned to a single project, I'd spend a good chunk of my time in meetings.

This one is interesting. While there is inherently nothing wrong in high-pace cadence, the lowest Scrum recommends is one-week cycle. That means one planning, one retro, one review. Refinements are not included, because you do them on as-needed basis. As we can see here, this is not Scrum. And judging by you being burnt-out, it fails also on one of the core principles ""Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. ""

---

Another thing entirely is - those are NOT rituals. Each one of them serves a purpose, and believe me - if you haven't worked in a Scrum or Agile yet, and I am quite certain that you haven't based on your description - daily\*, the only one that is ""always"" takes AT MOST 15 minutes; and we are talking 8-9 people in the meeting. Singular purpose - ""how we can plan &lt;&lt;today&gt;&gt; as best as possible?"". Without planning/refinements\* you will never do proper product, you'll get Jira dump that has no relation to your knowledge - after all, programmers ought to work together with business. Without review, you cannot\* get feedback from users. Without retrospective, you cannot\* inspect and **adapt**.

No amount of looking at IDE and being creative will matter at all if you are working on a wrong product, if you don't understand what you really have to do.

So please, don't blame Agile for what your company ISN'T doing at all.

\* And of course by *cannot* I don't mean that how scrum suggests that it should be done is THE solution. While modifying scrum means that you are not doing scrum, I can perfectly see all those meetings done in a different way - as long as you satisfy the purpose. After all, this is the core of agile - collaborate, inspect, adapt with FOCUS; and so on.",1649149662,programming,Venthe,programming,Comment,515

8738,"""x = x + 1"" doesn't make people's brains implode when learning programming because they understand very quickly that the equal sign means a different thing in programming.

Similarly I don't think people frequently get confused when using Venn diagrams (a concept they are already familiar with that helps them understand how things ""overlap"" - which is the fundamental concept in SQL joins) because they think it means something else altogether.

For what it's worth I found the chequered flag definitely the worst of the lot, it's not intuitive at all and it's easiest to understand _when you already know_ what joins are. That's the biggest advantage of Venn diagrams to me - it's intuitive and helps you get past the initial barrier.",1649144348,programming,raddaya,programming,Comment,123

&gt; - Users may have JavaScript disabled.
&gt; - Browsers may not recognize the JavaScript syntax (maybe they‚Äôre old (the browser, not the user)).
&gt; - Browser extensions block scripts from running (&lt;- hey, that‚Äôs me).

&gt; - Users may have intermittent connection (on a train).
&gt; - The device may be behind a firewall.

How are the last 3 solved by progressive enhancement? Form submissions still require a network connection to work. And indeed, some approaches to fixing issues like intermittent connectivity - e.g., storing data local-first - rely on JS.

EDRs are issued in very limited circumstances, like child abductions where about 76% of the time the child is dead within three hours, and 89% within 24 hours. While you're right that most crimes have plenty of time for investigation, there are a small number of them where every second count, and waiting for a judge is a problem.

Tracking people absolutely requires a tracking warrant, and can't be done by an EDR. Those are handled through state or federal courts and Rule 41(c) reviews. They take ALWAYS take time to go through the courts, and time to initiate.

Backdoors are a different class of problems altogether. This isn't a backdoor, but an explicitly created exception as a front door. The emergency contacts for major corporations are easily obtained directly from the company's website, so nothing secret or back-door about it. 

The frequency of use is also a major difference.

The need for police departments to request information in the case of an ""imminent life or death situation"" effectively is another thing to debate. It's a good thing to have I think ""in theory"", as sometimes getting a warrant for said information can take a while. However - unless there are strict penalties for abusing such measures, there's no point to having them as they will be abused. In my opinion, they simply need to force police to prove after the fact how it was related to an imminent life or death scenario, and if they can't sufficiently prove it - then fire anyone in that police department responsible for the request (never let them be police anywhere else either), and perhaps even give them a jail sentence of a few months or longer (depending on the degree of fraud).",1649119415,programming,echonian,programming,Comment,240

The attack itself is not new. I remember even back learning about them, and the risk associated with them. It has been suspended and caught before, but never known to succeed. All that changed is that the attack was observed in the wild with the criminals identified. 

15 years ago they were still a theoretical attack, and the discussion was about balancing the urgency of a situation versus the risk. The laws generally allow it because the potential damage of NOT following the request is so high. When police contact the emergency number with a story of a person in immediate risk, and ask for information like the last known GPS location, it gets tricky. 

There are unfortunate real world situations where life is on the line, and the extra 30 minutes to get an emergency court order can make the difference between life and death. That is why the exception exists. 

Adding a requirement to get additional verification sounds nice but adds time the victim likely does not have. Companies are supposed to do basic due diligence and then pass the information on. The laws around it generally grant exceptions to privacy laws in that scenario. 

Even if additional steps are required criminals will find ways around them. Criminals already issue fake warrants and fake subpoenas, that's why companies with resources will contact the court to verify authenticity. Small businesses may not, and just give the criminals the information.

A nice advantage of that explanation, is that, that's pretty likely how your JOIN is being performed by the database anyway!

**LEFT JOIN**: Same thing, but if a row in T1 has no matching rows in T2, return the T1 row anyway, combined with a fake T2 row that has all NULLs.

I really don't like Venn Diagrams anymore, because Venn Diagrams are _usually_ meant for categorizing objects (points in space) into categories (big circles).

To your question, the ""progressive"" part is setting the baseline functionality to use HTML forms, then if/when JS is available, enhance it to use fetch.

But this readme is only understandable to someone who knows regex very well already. That's the assumption in all the examples, and in the playground as well. It leaves out absolutely everyone looking for a simpler way of pattern matching than regex, since you need to know regex to understand this.

The Syntax section is just a list, not very descriptive, no examples, so it's not very helpful. For example, what does this mean to someone who doesn't already know what regex {6,} is supposed to do:

""over ... of - used to express more than an amount of a pattern. equivalent to regex {6,} (assuming over 5 of ...)""

You can sort suss it out, but how about a simple example of input/output text to help directly visualize it?

The comments in the examples only give the purpose of each example, which doesn't always give up what the pattern is supposed to do. Again, no input/output text in the examples clinches it, since without that you're left just trying to guess what patterns are being matched using purely imaginary text and a lack of understanding of not one but two forms of syntax.

I'm sure regex pros understand the readme, the syntax, can visualize the patterns and resulting text, and understand the examples, so there's all that -- for them. Have at it!

9045,"&gt;Question: It seems like we're intending for the PwmSysfs to basically be a singleton (for a given url). Is that right? Corollary Question: What is supposed to happen if I call sys::init more than once with the same Url?

I just planned to add guarantee of not duplicating the resources at the config parsing level. For the reusability the code should probably make sure no instance exists for same path (as having 2 PWM devices referring to same one makes no logical sense for the use case)

&gt; My gut reaction is to do this in one of two ways: You can either create a PwmFactory struct that keeps track of all created PwmSysfs structs that are created and implement it kind of like a thread-pool (I'll elaborate in a sec), or do what you're doing and spawn an extra thread per created PwmSysfs.

I was tempted to do that because that doesn't proliferate unnecessary threads, as the ""cleanup"" function could just iterate over all of them at once and they are always initialized at start and closed at the end.

But I also liked each of them being entirely independent of eachother and the fact that on stop all of them will immediately start resetting settings, not in serial way. Doesn't really matter for sysfs drivers but might for some other ones. Then again the factory *could* just spawn a thread for each of the drivers that require some waiting so that might be best way to do it.

&gt; And I'm also fairly sure that the path functions can work with references/borrows, so you can just use &amp;enable_path instead of enable_path.clone().

Yeah that's ""I didn't know I could"" moment, I just assumed that function only takes String type

&gt; Something like that, anyway. It's not terribly different than what you have now, but what you have now is not very DRY. You probably want to write a private fn just for resetting the hardware fan, and have your signal-watcher and your factory/impls call that function rather than repeating the fs::writes all over the place.

That was purely my laziness as I wanted to have something working before I get into rabbit hole of ""how to convince Rust I can call `pwm.cleanup()` from the thread"". The original code was just

    let _ = thread::Builder::new().name(format!(""envmon {} fence"", split_path[2])).spawn(move || {
        println!(""in thread"");
        for sig in signals.forever() {
            pwm.cleanup();
            return;
        }
    });
    return Ok(pwm)

But obviously Rust didn't allow for sharing that between the threads so I went for shortcut and just... not shared the data in the first place.

Either way the best course of action for me seems to be getting into concurrency primitives instead of trying to do it the easy way out. Thanks for clarifications and help!",1649100911,programming,Beneficial_Topic_667,programming,Comment,460

Is wrong. Had I linked to just the tweet you'd not have had the references to check, nor the subsequent discussion.

The author's transpiler[1] and his notes on it make it clear that the generated C++ code was very much intended to need no manual changes. According to the links and the discussion on that page, the generated C++ code was the final code included in the first CLR.

Sounds to me like the ""original"" GC was first prototyped in Lisp, then compiled* to C++ for actual inclusion in the product. I _very_ much doubt whether the Lisp code ever ran within the rest of the product that later became the .Net framework without being first converted to C++ _and_ at the very least having manually-written ""glue"" code added; it's more than likely that the Lisp-compiled-to-C++ code required manual changes before it could even be included in the product. Whatever the exact build process, it would still have been compiled with the then-current Microsoft C++ compiler, Visual C++ 6.0. Exactly what counts as ""original"" when machine translation is involved is a bit of a semantic rabbit hole.

What you have said echoes my thoughts perfectly.

This came from upper management wanting us to integrate this service into our current frontend. My boss / tech lead decided it needed to be rebuilt from scratch because they couldn't understand it / it was unworkable. When this was presented to us after 6 months of them poking around in the current ""legacy system"" I asked why we don't just build an API around the existing database and use that for the frontend. Their response was that they had already spent 6 months coming up with the design, that we couldn't do what we needed with the current system (untrue) and discarded the idea.

So now we're stuck rewriting logic and copy pasting shit code that we don't understand and praying that it will work in the end because the original system is completely untested.

I feel incredibly anxious about the high likelihood of failure. Upper management also wants the features in the frontend to be done ASAP even though we're not even halfway done the rewrite, let alone started building the rest API that will be based on the rewrite that the frontend depends on.

At one point I spent several days un-stitching the massive .h file back into individual files that made more sense, combining some into a precompiled header unit, etc., trying to make a more conventional solution that wasn't too confusing.

And later, I found out he un-did all of that and went back to a single .h file. I wound up un-stitching that stuff *again*.

9221,"Sorry for taking a while to respond to this.

Interesting scenario! Thanks for sharing.

The complication here is obviously that you have true global state, which can be tricky/ugly. 

So, my initial thought is that you can't really do ""true"" RAII, because destructors are not guaranteed to run in certain circumstances. At the same time, in a ""normal"" execution of your program, RAII with the PwmSysfs struct is how it's ""supposed"" to work. So, this is a little tricky.

Question: It seems like we're intending for the PwmSysfs to basically be a singleton (for a given url). Is that right?
Corollary Question: What is supposed to happen if I call sys::init more than once with the same Url?

My gut reaction is to do this in one of two ways: You can either create a PwmFactory struct that keeps track of all created PwmSysfs structs that are created and implement it kind of like a thread-pool (I'll elaborate in a sec), or do what you're doing and spawn an extra thread per created PwmSysfs.

As an aside: I don't think you need hardly any of your string clones. I'm fairly sure that the format! macro doesn't actually consume the objects it's given, so you can just pass the String as-is. And I'm also fairly sure that the path functions can work with references/borrows, so you can just use `&amp;enable_path` instead of `enable_path.clone()`.

For the Factory approach, it'll probably be the most simple to just have the Factory hold on to an Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;Vec&lt;Stuff&gt;&gt;&gt; (or a HashMap instead of Vec, or a Mutex instead of RwLock) where the Vec holds all the info needed to reset the fan, including a unique ID so that you can find a specific fan when it drops on its own.

Then you spawn the signal-watching thread in the Factory's constructor and it takes either a clone or ""downgrade"" of the Arc'd data (meaning it could hold on to a Weak&lt;RwLock&lt;Vec&lt;Stuff&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of an Arc&lt;&gt;). When the app dies unexpectedly, it'll grab the data and reset all those fans *if* the Factory is still alive.

When the Factory creates a new PwmSysfs, that PwmSysfs will be given an id and a reference to the Factory (probably another Arc, for simplicity). When the PwmSysfs is dropped, it tells the factory to reset that fan and to remove it from being tracked by the Factory.

Something like that, anyway. It's not terribly different than what you have now, but what you have now is not very DRY. You probably want to write a private fn just for resetting the hardware fan, and have your signal-watcher and your factory/impls call that function rather than repeating the fs::writes all over the place.",1649083992,programming,ragnese,programming,Comment,451

What I loved about this kind of programming was how tight you could make things because of instruction re-use as instruction-flow comes from different directions. And for programs battling in a ""3D core"", size is very important, since your harder to damage and easier to copy if you're small.

It might be interesting for you to set up a simple battle-simulator using your VM/instructions as a way to visualize program execution as well as to exercise the language.

I used relative directions; the instruction's direction modifier would be applied to the current execution direction (after executing the instruction). This allowed for a lot of tricky re-use of instructions -- more suitable for a toy ""corewars"" language, probably, than a practical one.

Your use of a separate data-pointer is interesting and maybe a better idea. I used addressing based off the current instruction pointer, which led to several addressing modes: basic offset in the current direction (eg. `mov 0 1` simply moves the current `mov` instruction to the next cell in current direction), or treating the offset location as a relative pointer (3D or 1D).",1649082115,programming,glacialthinker,programming,Comment,234

So if you're looking at a piece of code that says it's the first version of the GC for .NET, and that code is in C++, then it's not the first version.

9317,"&gt; I feel like its the type of things where if you gave a competent dev a month of time... they could probably rewrite that entire file into a way easier to maintain application.

This is a common belief of students who mainly have experience coding up tightly specified, totally self-contained projects for school. That experience gives them the idea that anything can be coded by one person quickly and better too. In reality, it would probably take one person several months just to come up with a design. That person would have to master the entire file to infer what the requirements are which alone would probably take months of careful reasoning. Then, maybe they could code it in a month or maybe 6 months. It depends on their work ethic and skill as well as on the complexity of the logic plus how good their design was. And at the end of it, they will find they created many, many new bugs. That new system will turn into the legacy system for anyone who just got hired. It will be frail here and there when ""duh, why didn't they just make that part magically flexible."" But alas, it isn't, and it will take a serious change to fix this bug or add that feature. The newer the programmer is, the higher the chance it's overly flexible where the genericity just makes for unneeded abstractions and confusion and totally rigid where high velocity changes are needed. It takes years upon years of real-world experience to design a respectable product.

I'll leave you with the old claim that rewriting code is never the solution. Basically, people don't come up with the right requirements as they infer them or negotiate with customers. They then create a whole new system with tons of new bugs and ""bad designs"". There's a story where Netscape, an old internet browser, used to have a substantial percent of the market. The last decision they made was to throw away all the code and create a totally awesome Netscape. Things didn't go so well as usual.

In this situation, it's better to introduce improvements gradually to the 11k file. Add testing however you can. Bringing it fully under test would be quite amazing as you could then fearlessly refactor, but it's a tall order. Rearrange and group lines with a vision of bringing them into their own function one day. Segment up the 11k file into 2 5.5k files if you can and the organization is logical. Morph it into a file with a couple 100 functions even if there still is one monster one that is 6k lines. Trust me, making a brand new system would take much more work than you described, have extremely high risk from a business point of view, and most likely result in travesty unless you happened to hire someone like Linus Torvalds to replace it.

// so you have to provide a function that takes two instances from A (whatever that may be),

// The type is ""A"", because the method itself does not care (or know) what exactly we are trying to sort.
// Because it does not know or care, we have to provide the comparison between our objects ourselves.
// So, this is what we do here - our Sequence is a List of Persons, i.e. List[Person], so the generic type A
// resolves to a ""Person"" in this case.

personList.sortWith((p1, p2) =&gt; p1.age &lt; p2.age)
// List(Person(omg,30,15), Person(bar,40,20), Person(foo,50,10)): scala.collection.immutable.List[Person]

9339,"&gt; Why go object oriented at all at this point. I mean I pretty new to all of this but I'd guess it would be much easier to inherit the base class and then make modifications or overliad functions?

In C#, there are no freeform functions. In the use case described, all the functions were pure meaning they didn't depend on state inside an object. Classes at that point are just a way to organize freeform functions by grouping them under a name. Here, it seems the organization was centered around customers as each customer had slightly different reports.

I'm not sure if the guy posting that story is exaggerating, but making a generic report generator is pretty tough, and generating reports are naturally quite procedural. I personally find it hard to believe that there was actually dozens of 20,000 line report generators. I could easily imagine each one being hundreds to a couple thousand though.

I worked at a company that had one big mess of code that reached into various tables in our system, creating a jumbo report for some people in business.

9383,"&gt;\&gt; Ada is a design by committee.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not sure I agree with this.

I saw this claim recently. I don't know if it is true. I know that it was the winner of a competition. As you said: ""It is a more complicated language than it needs to be"". So I just thought that the claim about ""design by committee"" is true. For me it feels as design by committee without having a proof for it.

&gt;\&gt; [Seed7](http://seed7.sourceforge.net) is an extensible programming language.  
&gt;  
&gt;I had never heard of Seed7 before. Thanks for bringing attention to your project. From what I can see in the link, your work is very impressive.

Thank you for the praise. Hopefully you download and try it. :-)

&gt;\&gt; Ada can be used for low level unportable systems programming.  
&gt;  
&gt;True for Ada83. Not sure for Ada95 or later.

I don't know Ada95. Did they remove features such that unportable systems programming becomes impossible? I thought that Ada can be used for systems programming like C.

&gt;\&gt; Ada is not designed for easy compilation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Agreed. Perhaps a compiler vendor/maker does not need to support the full language.

I always thought that an Ada compiler needs to support the whole language. Otherwise it could not claim to compile Ada. Has this changed?

&gt;It would have been interesting to see what you would have come up with if you had a budget like the US DoD.

I would like to get funding for [Seed7](http://seed7.sourceforge.net). :-) As I mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/seed7/comments/td4i90/seed7_version_20220312_released_on_github_and_sf/i0hmvbd/?context=3) I make 0‚Ç¨ with Seed7.

OTOH I can see problems with Ada, which might relate to the funding. In the early days the Ada language was set in stone (they used even the name StoneMan). I consider this as too early. IIRC most Ada compilers were developed afterwards and it took years until some showed up. This way weaknesses of Ada could not be fixed. The end result is a language that is hard to compile. If a compiler / interpreter is developed in parallel to the language the result is IMHO much better.

An example is the overloading. In Ada the result of an expression is considered for overloading resolution. The [Seed7 overloading](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/faq.htm#overload_result) does not consider the result. This simplifies things a lot. In Seed7 the following principle holds:

&gt;The type of every expression (and sub expression) is known at compile time.¬†This is independent from the place where this expression is used.¬†

This principle is also explained [here](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/faq.htm#type_inference) (why Seed7 does not use type inference).

This leads me to the reason I released Seed7: Feedback and help to improve [Seed7](http://seed7.sourceforge.net) is always welcome. :-)",1649067431,programming,ThomasMertes,programming,Comment,440

Yes, you should have reuse!

Except for general bugs (to be fixed in the base class), though, there's no reason why changes to one customer's report should affect another's, and putting customer code into separate files is a way of enforcing that. Otherwise you end up with complexity bloat because of how he each new feature interacts with the others.

In my case I wrote classes for handling the read/write on disk of various raw files (image data). And while you could build something generic to handle many formats, it quickly would get out of hand because of minor variations that require changes at various places.

So there's the base read/write interface, one base class for each kind of header (because obviously why would headers be all the same) then the actual classes that implement the specific stuff. For what could be shared, I made helper functions in the upper classes. Stuff like virtual properties really helped with the header (because why would you waste 20 bytes to keep your header the same size for monochrome images right?).",1649059241,programming,ConfusedTransThrow,programming,Comment,139

9456,"Sharing my story here.

So I was in a similar situation in early dev days where I had to clean up a codebase which consists of a few PHP files, a few unused html code; 2 JS files, each with 3000 lines of code in jQuery with some plugin stuff; and a TS file from someone attempted to make the codebase look better, only to realise it was a pain to do so and scatter more poop to it. 

The cleanup needed to be done within 2 weeks. Of course it was impossible and had to extend to more than a month. 

First thing was to integrate webpack to allow code modularised (import export). Originally, the project was built into one JS file by first echoed from each file to get the strings, then concat them into one string and add a global var before that entire string, then write them to a new file. For some reason that file worked for a few years, but no one dared to touch that PHP file.

The next challenge was to modularised the code base, which still use ajax. There was someone idea that using ajaxstop instead of promise all. It was the actual answer when someone wondering why our tool didn‚Äôt work with a platform, all because that platform also used ajaxstop which stepped on our code and sometimes froze the whole web (you can‚Äôt even refresh the webpage to resolve the issue).

You can write Rust-like synchronizing types in C++ without too much trouble, but with lessened lifetime checking. The usual approach to decrease lifetime issues is then to invert the logic -- rather than getting a lock guard + ref to T out of a synchronized type, you pass in modifier action, as it is much harder to leak ref out of the action.

At least we‚Äôre slowly getting features into production so it‚Äôs not a complete failure. 

The thing is, the original codebase has no tests or any spec defining how something is supposed to work, and things work differently based on both customer types and user roles. So just knowing what is even a feature, and for whom, can be a real challenge. 

It‚Äôs scary to add features to the legacy app since you never know for sure if you break something for someone in the process - and frequently that is exactly what happens.

9539,"Yup, wasted many years on that one.  ;-)  

FWIW, note that I don't mention side effects above. It's not a ""lets all program in Haskell!"" point, it's a point about how to do abstraction.  Even if you never touch any languages that are considered FP languages, the point I'm making still applies perfectly well. I learned it by reading sooooo much about programming, and trying everything I could in reality over 39 years.

 I've probably worked more in OOP than anything else in that time. I've worked with serious, dedicated smart people who thought deeply and read deeply about all this, just as I did.  Many of us went on a similar journey with pure FP too. You can get just as lost thinking about Monads.  There are distracting aesthetics in both worlds and real issues too.

I could spend ages thinking up fancy metaphors for what OOP projects are like, and naming abstract structural problems that arise from them  (and thinking of fancy new ways to overcome them) and it wouldn't achieve anything other than to waste my time ranting about the architecture of nothing (and maybe a book / YouTube channel).  Oh wait, that *is* like OOP ;-)

So my takeaway from all that:

- K.I.S.S.
- Less is more.
- Functions are the basic unit of abstraction.
- Avoid languages that ban side effects (but use them only where necessary).
- Avoid languages that force you to use objects.

There are workarounds, of course, but recognising them as workarounds and impediments is called enlightenment.

Of course, nobody ever learned anything by listening to old codgers like me, everybody takes the long route (if at all). That's why everything is so broken ;-)",1649051102,programming,tealeg,programming,Comment,285

Some of it was an ORM, some of it was raw SQL, some of it was stored procedures that weren‚Äôt in the repo we had, and it probably split up evenly between the three. My guess was that the old team‚Äôs members each had their own preferred way of querying the database, so they each refused to standardize, leading to duplicate functionality between the three methods.

The report generation was why we were rewriting the app. It was too slow and clients would miss deadlines for submitting reports to a government body because the reports wouldn‚Äôt be finished in time. The problems came down to a terrible database and awfully generated code (they also had a lot of client-specific classes). The queries in the generated code were awful, partially because the database could not figure out how to query efficiently.

For example, one massive table had a start date and an end date, both the same type of column and neither had any indexes or anything to help speed up querying. If you filtered by the start date (like the reports did), then it would take minutes to run a simple query that filtered for a single day. However, after a couple days of scouring these reporting classes and the database schema for any hints of a problem, I found that if you filtered by end date instead, the query would complete in seconds.

All in all, the refactoring wasn‚Äôt terrible. Reporting tools offer a lot of easy and flexible functionality nowadays, and we were able to convert some of the classes in just a few hours while greatly improving generation time, but I didn‚Äôt stick around long enough to see how that project turned out.",1649045841,programming,TheHoratian,programming,Comment,331

IIRC, basically all of the reports for every customer existed in their own class. When a new customer would sign up, you‚Äôd copy/paste the file into its own class, change a property to match a customer ID of some kind, and then deploy it. This is because customers would often add for custom metrics within the reports, so each report needed to changed slightly. 

Obviously, this had a metric fuck ton of problems. Firstly, whenever a report was doing something it wasn‚Äôt supposed to, we had to dig through thousands of lines. The classes weren‚Äôt all self contained; sometimes they‚Äôd reach into other customers for functionality (it was all static classes). Removing a customer (and their subsequent reports) would cause dozens of compile errors, and there were no unit tests to make sure that the right code was preserved. So old customers were kept in the code.

Secondly, whenever an improvement was to be made to a report, *you‚Äôd need to do it for every customer*. Every time a project manager would ask for a change in a report I remember hearing groans from the developers. There was one particular fellow which all he did was manage these reports. He seemed absolutely miserable.

9793,"Design goals for proper, real-world coding

1. Keep your variable names short; as short as possible - one letter is best.  That way, only you will ever be able to understand what you did.  This will make you a) look extremely clever - you'll have all of these solutions that nobody else can work out (that's smarts, there) and b) you'll be irreplaceable. 
2. Ignore style guides and team norms alongside any other matters such as idiomatic coding practices for your language, because they're just for squares man and you're an individual.  Also, if you're not making up a new way of doing something, you're accepting that you're not the cleverest person in the world (which is plainly untrue), so following the pack is just behaviour for sheeple.  
3. Never use source control.  If you can't keep all of your changes in your head, you're just not that bright. 
4. Make functions as long as possible.  Everyone knows that great coders are great *precisely because* they work on huge codebases.  If you can take any old ""to-do"" program and make it into millions of lines of code, you're basically the same as someone coding the Linux kernel.  
5. Argue.  Like *all of the time*.  Start your arguments with ""I'm not an expert but..."" and then voice an opinion on the technical approach to something.  It doesn't matter if you're wrong, the force of opinion is what counts.  Like religion, it can't possibly be untrue if you believe it this forcefully - the strength of your opinion is evidence in itself of its own truth.  If you can argue with senior devs that's better, but don't limit yourself.  Just have opinions that are different.  
6. Reinvent the wheel.  If there's a solution out there to do a thing, the people who came up with it are nowhere near your level of genius as a developer, so they probably did it wrong anyway.  This fits with point 4 - it's a nice little way to get more lines into your code.",1649020118,programming,Brilliant-Drawer-262,programming,Comment,339

9893,"&gt; Attempting to smartly detect featured/guest artists based on ‚Äúfeaturing‚Äù/‚Äúfeat.‚Äù/‚Äúwith‚Äù in the artist tag falls apart

I've always personally stood by using separate tagging for featuring. Not all software supports non-standard tagging, so that definitely sucks, but I've used foobar2000 for a long time, which both supports custom tagging and allows you to modify the display of other fields dynamically based on custom tagging e.g. the ""Artist"" column can be set to actually display ""[Artist or Album Artist] ft. [Featuring]"".

ID3 attempts to be an industry standard (at least for mp3), which includes reserved / intended tagging for an ""Involved people's list"" (effectively meant to be featuring) as TIPL, as well as other fields that different software treats / handles completely differently, such as POPM for rating. It's not going to solve all the edge cases by any stretch, but it's not bad.

How can this (seemingly exponential) brute-force algorithm be polynomial? You never need more than 26 guesses to solve Wordle in English (lemma 3), so your brute force algorithm only needs to check scenarios with up to 26 guesses. Therefore we can upper-bound the running time of the brute force algorithm by a constant, which technically means it's polynomial.

I.e., The brute-force algorithm is exponential time with respect to |D|, but there's a maximum bound on |D| (there can only be 26^5 words).

But for reasonable sized dictionaries (such as English, where |D| is much smaller than the theoretical maximum, because words like rcokk do not exist), the algorithm will appear to be exponential because it does depend exponentially on |D| up until the maximum.",1649009154,programming,markasoftware,programming,Comment,147

9915,"Does this even mention classical music? This is often the weakness of music services.

Very long musical piece names which makes displaying a challenge.

Very hard to search as there are often hundreds of versions of the same piece.

Need to show composer separate from the ‚Äúmusician‚Äù playing the piece.

The hilarity of asking a voice assistant the name of a piece and the impossibility of asking it to play a specific piece.",1649007562,programming,giga,programming,Comment,73

9917,"For the purposes of solving the puzzle, you're right that any strategy to solve wordle as defined in the paper will solve wordle as defined by /u/atrizzle at least as quickly. But it's possible (depending on exactly how D' is chosen) that the problem given by /u/atrizzle will have lower computational complexity than wordle as defined by the paper (imagine the scenario when D' consists of only a single word).

The cookbooks can help you get a job / pass an interview / solve a set of problems in a project. Another useful synonym here is 'tactical'  
The textbooks help you keep a job / level up / prevent problems at the design level before they creep into implementation. These are often more 'strategic'",1649006133,programming,justinpitts,programming,Comment,87

9939,"The idea that a developer can ever fully understand all of the tools and technologies required to create any useful application is incorrect. 

Most of the tools any dev, senior or mid level or junior, are a black box. And they will always be a black box, because the time it takes to fully understand any one layer of the tooling you‚Äôre using is immense and our time on this planet is short.

The idea that a software developer should understand all of everything that‚Äôs going is impossible and unnecessary. If you can afford to view something as a black box, you should because it saves time. To use a tool you just need to understand its inputs and outputs. That‚Äôs a black box and it‚Äôs a good thing.

Being an efficient developer means being able to determine the things that are actually worth learning up front and only learning those things. If you attempt to understand everything not only will you fail, you‚Äôll also end up being very slow and ineffective.",1649005239,programming,chillermane,programming,Comment,172
