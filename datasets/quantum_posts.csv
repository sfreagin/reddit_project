What makes a good quantum use case?,1615907815,"TLDR: can someone explain simply what makes a good use case for quantum computing with some examples?

It's pretty clear that almost every industry is trying to come up with some problem to justify investing in quantum computing, and once in a while there is a new press release about some very specific problem where it sort of made sense to use a quantum computer, like portfolio optimization (investing) or codon optimization for DNA (pharma) like in this article: [https://www.zdnet.com/article/quantum-computing-quantum-annealing-versus-gate-based-quantum-computers/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/quantum-computing-quantum-annealing-versus-gate-based-quantum-computers/)

The common theme seems to be the requirement to fiddle with many different variables at the same time to assess the outcome.....sort of like trying to tune in a radio with 50 different knobs that can all be turned at the same time and the position of any one of them might affect the optimum position of the others.

Right when I start to think that this kind of thing will apply to the most sexy scientific problems rich with high-level physics, the problems with a high economic impact (if you are able to make an incremental improvement) might seem more important.

I attended a talk recently by a company in the aeronautics industry who ran a quantum challenge and rather than choosing a winning team who proposed a solution to a very physics-rich problem like airplane wing design etc. they went with a team that focused on loading of cargo into planes as a use case for quantum.

The overall theme seems to be that you can kind of convince yourself that there might be some real world applications for quantum computing once the hardware improves in a few years, but it sounds like people are happy to say that our brains aren't used to thinking up problems that quantum computing will be able to solve, so that's why we are having trouble thinking of use cases.....and definitely not because there aren't any.

Anyway...just wondering if anyone can explain simply what sorts of problems will be optimal for quantum computing as the various industries start to try to identify use cases where it would make sense to start fiddling with the technology.",QuantumComputing,doxorubicin2001d,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/m6bdel/what_makes_a_good_quantum_use_case/,11

 Paraphrased:

&gt;We propose a general tensor network method for simulating quantum circuits. The method is massively more efficient in computing a large number of correlated bitstring amplitudes and probabilities than existing methods. Using our method with 60 GPUs, we have generated one million correlated bitstrings from the Sycamore circuit, with linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) fidelity of 0.739, which is much higher than the fidelity of 0.002 achieved in Google's quantum supremacy experiments.

Took them five days on those GPUs, although I'm sure the same method could be done in far less time if they were aiming for 0.002 fidelity instead of 0.7. That said, the algorithm scales poorly with circuit depth, so if error rates in the quantum computers are reduced enough to do deeper circuits with good fidelity, they should actually be impractical to simulate classically. In the meantime tensor network algorithms may be able to simulate most NISQ computers...",QuantumComputing,spacetimesandwich,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/m1pnt5/simulating_the_sycamore_quantum_supremacy_circuits/,0

Guest Speaker Professor Nicholas Curro: Color Centers in Diamond for Quantum Sensing Applications,1614824449,"Hello! I'm with the Quantum Computing Club @ UC Davis and this **Friday from 4-5pm PST** Professor Curro will be joining us to give a talk on his research  in color centers. Below you can read a quick overview of what this  week's meeting will entail:

I  will give a brief introduction to the science of nitrogen-vacancy  centers in diamond, and how they can be used for quantum sensing and  quantum information science.  The science of NV centers has advanced  dramatically over the past decade, and they are now regularly used for a  broad range of field and temperature sensing, quantum information  storage, and even inertial navigation systems.   I will introduce  concepts such as quantum superposition, and how to manipulate a quantum  bit, and how to use an NV center as a sensor.

Probably more fundamental, is the inability to enforce hard constraints, which makes even representing non-binary values impossible.

Can quantum computing finally crack PGP encryption?,1614362270,"The theory behind quantum computing allows for all possibilities of a complex task to be completed at the same time.

Hence the question: with the intensive research behind quantum computer technology, could it be possible for the FBI, CIA, and other agencies to decrypt PGP?

In this context, it is of paramount importance to highlight something that most fail to notice, or just simply don’t have the interest to delve into: the discoverers of quantum physics were deeply spiritual people; unlike many of today’s physicists, the founding fathers of quantum physics were passionately interested in the philosophical implications of their discoveries. This gets obviously clear when one takes the time and effort to actually read and study their thoughts and opinions about what they had discovered. A good place to start is, obviously, their own publications, but those who are not familiar with the subject matter, it can be said that what gets you really started is Fritjof Capra’s excellent 1975 book The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism.

What is the use of quantum tomography?,1613123054,"First time poster and just started with quantum computing for my master thesis, so I'm sorry if the question seems obvious.

I understand that the tomography is used to reconstruct the state and/or process of a quantum circuit, without directly measuring the used qubits but instead using many 'copies' of it. What we then get is the quantum state as a density matrix or the quantum process in e.g. choi matrix representation.

But isn't this process of tomography way too costly to really make use of it? 
If I understand it correctly, we could use this choi matrix representation to replace our circuit process, but does it improve something?
And can we use the state tomography for anything else than verification/error mitigation?",QuantumComputing,riovel,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/li7ux8/what_is_the_use_of_quantum_tomography/,7

I’ve heard of firms like D-Wave but these are still largely private and the best way to invest in them is through a fund that’s holds these private securities (like TURN on Nasdaq).
Was interested to know if there were any other ways or firms that were easy to invest in to get a pure play on the quantum computing industry (long term, 5+ years hold).

Continuous Variable Quantum Neural Network,1612803729,"Using the continuous variable paradigm of QC, it is possible to build a neural network. This, of course, is also possible in the qubit model with variational quantum classifiers. Both models creates a circuit out of trainable quantum gates.

My questions about this are around why you would choose one option over another. If I have a traditional dataset, say the iris dataset, I need to encode it before entering the circuit. I'm unsure then how one option could be preferable if both are coming from this discrete source?

Also, in Continuous-variable quantum neural networks by Killoran et al. they state:

""It is important to emphasize that, unlike many previous approaches using discrete variables, the CV formalism allows us
to enact nonlinear transformations between functions, similar
to classical neural networks, using purely linear operations,
i.e., the unitary gates in a quantum circuit. This duality is
due to the fact that the native domain of the CV model is
the vector space L2(C).""

Could someone simplify this for me a bit? Specifically, are they implying that using a qubit based variational circuit network cannot enact non-linear transforms? Is this a reason why CV networks could be preferable?

Are there some examples where there is a clear preference for using one type of network over another?

On potential financial applications of quantum computing technology and their implications.,1612749394,"I'm still brushing up (starting literally from scratch) on the underlying science of quantum technology. As such, this may sound incredibly stupid but that's ok with me.

Outside of technology companies there are several other industries that are interested in quantum computing and its applications, based on investment. The finance and banking sector are foremost among them (along with the health sector). In essence my question is just, ""why?"" but I'll break it down a little more.

From my understanding, the most immediately tangible benefit in the foreseeable future would be in increasing efficiency and accuracy across pretty much all computationally intensive/ large scale financial models. It could also ""unlock"" new strategies/systems that were not previously viable or conceivable. Is this accurate?

Further down the line (and into speculation) we could see current industry standard encryptions broken by quantum computing &amp; or be able to transmit data instantaneously. The reason I lumped these two together is because either would make a large portion of our financial systems (increasingly digital) largely obsolete or unsafe.

Some personal stuff happened and I wasn't able to continue my studies towards a physics PhD at the time and had to take up a job to help my folks. I am now looking to get back in Physics and my interest has changed to Quantum Information/Computation.

Do you have any advice towards how I should approach this plan? I would prefer to have a position in the theoretical side . I don't have any publications. Should I do another masters in Physics to iron out the holes?

I'm hoping to reproduce Shor's algorithm for factoring 15, at which point I'll call the project finished. I found a circuit diagram here which looks surprisingly simple: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0112176.pdf?origin=publication\_detail&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=H6diU7GmLuey2gWAl4DoDQ&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAD&amp;usg=AFQjCNEe8V77cjLvR-2s5gtP2IhMTmrBsg](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0112176.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=H6diU7GmLuey2gWAl4DoDQ&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAD&amp;usg=AFQjCNEe8V77cjLvR-2s5gtP2IhMTmrBsg)

Figure 1 b. is the diagram I'm referring to. It just looks a lot simpler than I was expecting. Was hoping someone could shed some light. I assume (if the circuit is valid at all) that the 15ness in this circuit is supplied by the choice of which qubits are controlling which operations? I have some understanding of QC from university years ago, but it's been a while.

I also see a lot of diagrams containing a V gate, which Mike &amp; Ike's book defines as 'any operator' satisfying V\^2=U for some U', but I'm not sure how to generate that U to begin with.

Why won't this work for FTL data transfer,1611338084,"I assume the answer is ""you don't understand relatively well enough"", but I'd like to know a more concrete why.

Suppose you and I have a million entangled qubits and we have an ordering on them. We decide on a fixed message length. Every second you set the next qubit to either 1 or 0. At the next second I will read my matching qubit while you write to the next one. That is, I'm always a second behind you. If you have no message for me you just set the qubit for the given second to 0. If you do have a message you set the qubit to 1 and then use the next message length number of qubits for your message. Of course if your message is longer than that you can write another 1 and then write another block of your message.

Now, as you may have guessed, you and your qubits get in a rocket headed toward Mars. Of course, due to relativity time will be different between the two of us, so this is probably the part that messes the experiment up. But couldn't we both change the rate at which we either read or write depending on our acceleration relative to a relatively fixed position like the sun? I understand that this calculation could be complicated, but complicated doesn't mean impossible. I assume that there's something deeper in relativity that makes it impossible.

I'm writing a general quantum computer simulator in Python, just for fun. It's working well. Have simulated the Deutsch-Josza circuit, and the multi-qubit version, and a few other toy examples.

In particular I'm trying to swap two adjacent qubits in a several-qubit system. Am I correct that I can build the appropriate swap gate by writing

`[; I\_2 x I\_2 x ... x I\_2 x SWAP x I\_2 x ... x I\_2 ;]`

where x is the Kronecker product. That is, identity matrices for all the qubits to be left alone, and a SWAP covering the two to be swapped. I could have sworn that was it from my university days.",QuantumComputing,dvali,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/l251bd/programming_quantum_swap_gate_in_python/,3

Let's get some concepts cleared first!,1610478693,"***Here I expect to clarify a few basic concepts that are related to Quantum Mechanics. As I try to explain this to the general public, I shall keep myself to the layman's terms. Technical terms shall be avoided as much as possible.***

# Quantum Superposition

Quantum superposition is in layman terms, 'combination of states'. When I say states I mean any two or more distinguishable factors. In basic electronics theories, you may come across electrical states as 'high' and 'low'. Usually what we do is that we call 5V a high state and any voltage below that a low state (usually 0V but it doesn't really have to be 0V).

Let's take these high and low states to a standard 5V and 0V system. If you get 5V, you get a high state. If you get 0V, you get a low state. Now, we have set a certain upper bound (5V) and a certain lower bound (0V). We intentionally set a range around the upper and lower bounds to be on par with practical errors. Let's say we keep -1V to 1V as the ""low"" state and 4V to 6V as the ""high"" state. So any voltage between -1V and 1V will give a state of ""low"" and any voltage between 4V and 6V will give a state of ""high"". Any other value is neglected.

As you may see, we can only have either a ""low"" state or a ""high"" state but not both together. We cannot define a state that is ""low"" and ""high"" at the same time. So we call this a binary state. Because we can have only 2 states. Either ""low"" or ""high"".

But in quantum computing, things are different. I will explain why.

We need to go to the sub-atomic level to understand this. But first I want you to know something. There exists a theory named the ""de Broglie hypothesis"". Though it is a hypothesis we can observe its predictions very well. According to the de Broglie hypothesis, the matter that we are made of can show wavelike properties. But it is not conspicuous at the macro level. But when you go to the sub-atomic level things get groovy. The sub-atomic particles start to show wavelike properties.

Now, without going into deeper levels of physics let's say, a wave has the property of diffraction. That is, the wave can spread out while going through a narrow opening. You can observe this in everyday life. But the spooky thing is that when particles also start to do this at the subatomic level. Why? Because as I mentioned before, according to that de Broglie hypothesis, particles are bound to have that wavelike property.

Now, this brings us to a dilemma. Where can actually the particle be? Well, when we explain the particle in a wavelike manner we use something called ""wave function"". This wave function is what explains the position of the particle. We can make a measurement on that and find out the position. But then we come across another phenomenon called ""the uncertainty principle"". Without going into much detail let's say, this wave function fails to give both the position and the velocity of the particle at the same accuracy. If we make a measurement on the position we cannot get a good result of the velocity as the error will be too high. It's the same the other way too. So, we come across this uncertainty of both the position and velocity of the sub-atomic particle.

Now, how does this matter to us?

When we explain the properties of the sub-atomic particle which we use for states, we come across this uncertainty and we can only give a probability of which state it could be in. So it turns out, we can actually use this uncertainty to our advantage. So, this idea of superposition comes up. Since we can give only a probability of what state it could be, it leaves us with a superposition of these two states with probabilities of different values.

We use these superposition states as qubits. Yes, that's right!

# Quantum Entanglement

This is a weird theory, to be honest. But it is understandable. To say it very simply, quantum entanglement is two particles being in one system (a composite system) and when they do this they determine each other's properties. They cannot be explained separately but together. To put it even more simply, they are two particles acting like one. The weirdness of this is that there is no need for these two particles to be together at the same place. They can be in two different places thousands of miles apart. 

How does this happen?

Well, remember I mentioned a ""wave function"" earlier? Well, in this case, they have an ""entangled"" wave function. That means the wave functions are tied together to make a whole new wave function. But, the spooky thing is that, once we make an observation on either of these particles the wave function collapses into two different wave functions. There's a famous experiment on the spin of the particle regarding this quantum entanglement paradox. But explaining that requires a whole new article. Let's just say, simply, without being all scientific, ""particles have the ability to communicate within themselves before showing themselves to us."" (But this is not really what's happening though. This way makes it easier to understand.) 

How does this matter to us?

In cryptography, we have this need of generating public and private keys. These are really big numbers or patterns with complex relations. While creating these public keys we get this need of generating random numbers. Say that we have two qubits that are entangled. We need to have a private key between these two qubits. So what we do is that we generate random numbers on one qubit. Since these qubits are entangled, the other qubit gives the exact same outputs of random numbers on the other side. How cool is that? Also, there's this theory that explains that we cannot copy a qubit. That means we cannot create a clone of an entangled qubit either. So, it makes cracking the randomly generated key even tougher than we could imagine. You can search for Pauli's exclusion principle if you want further explanation on the ""non-cloning"" theory. But let's keep it the layman's level and say, entanglement is a real friend of ours when it comes to quantum cryptography.

# Decoherence

Let's start with what coherence is. Coherence is a property of waves that share common properties. So, in the wave function of some subatomic particles, we may observe correlations of physical properties. Actually, this is what leads to the entanglement of particles. Particles that are entangled relate themselves in every way. This property of relation is called coherence. But this coherence fades away due to external factors. That is called decoherence. 

How does this matter to us?

Well, in order to keep the entanglement of a pair of subatomic particles, we need to keep the coherence between the two particles as long as possible. To do that, we need to keep these particles in an environment that is isolated from the external world. That means we need sophisticated methods to isolate these particles. Sometimes we use supercooling methods to isolate and use an electromagnetic field to keep them stable in a sophisticated vacuum chamber.

Degrees and Schools for an Aspiring Quantum Computer Scientist,1610060456,"I'm currently in high school in central Ohio, and I'm super interested in quantum computing, but I'm not sure what the best education path would be to get there. I'm also interested in getting a PhD in Computer Science or Quantum Computing

Would the best undergraduate path be for Computer Science, Physics, or a double-major in both? Many colleges don't provide a quantum computing undergraduate program and even if they do, it's far away and expensive, are these worthwhile? It seems to me like a double major in Computer Science and Physics would be the best course of action.

Additionally, all the quantum computing jobs I could find require a Ph.D. in computer science, physics, etc. so does my undergraduate degree really matter?

Similarly, is finding a Quantum Computing or Quantum Physics Ph.D. program worthwhile or is a Ph.D. in CS fine?

How do you think about the relation between classical and quantum computing?,1609534165,"I know classical and quantum computing tend to be described in vastly different languages. What mental picture[s] do you use to think about quantum computing?

A few different pictures I can think of:

Complexity theory:
classical computers are weaker, expressed as a containment relation on the set of problems they can solve in polynomial time
P &lt;= PP &lt;= BQP (quantum computing) &lt;= PSPACE

Operational:
classical computers operate on a state. quantum computers operate on a complex vector of states.

Philosophical:
The universe solves problems that are *inherently* hard. Since reality is quantum, we can use that as an oracle machine to solve our hard problems. Classical computers just ignore that resource.

Geometric:
Quantum computers do something geometrical, via isometries and projections on tensor space. Classical computers operate on only *points* instead of the whole space.

Inequality constraints on D'Wave (using PyQUBO),1608485800,"Inequalities cannot be directly converted into a qubo form

0⩽ Expression ⩽ N

We can introduce a slack variable and convert it to an equality problem:

⟹ Expression + s = N

where:

 s ∈ Z,

s ∈ \[0,N\]

&amp;#x200B;

Since the slack variables, being encoded on a quantum computer, can hold only discrete values(0, 1, 2...N) the expression also must be of a discrete nature and be of the same values(0, 1, 2...N) to satisfy the constraint.

Query on Observables and gates,1607943498,"I am trying to understand Quantum Physics aspects from lectures of Theoretical minimum.

There an observable is represented by a 2x2 matrix, for example to observe spin in a z-direction. The observable is Pauli-Z matrix.

But in quantum computing, we see a 2x2 matrix as a gate operation, which is to change the state of Qubit.

&amp;#x200B;

Does it mean to observe u also have to change the state?

for example. consider the Pauli-Z matrix, the eigenvectors are |u&gt; and |d&gt;. And effect of Pauli-X matrix(sigma\_x) would be 

=&gt; sigma\_x \* |u&gt; = |d&gt;,   sigma\_x \* |d&gt; = |u&gt;

That means if I want to measure something in the X direction, it flips if its already in one of those orthogonal states(up, down).

&amp;#x200B;

Does it mean that in quantum computing, applying a gate is a measurement in another direction?

Like in the case above,  if I want to apply X-gate, I just measure in X-direction???

I’m a air conditioning contractor but also a deep thinker. Have this to say.,1607587716,"Hi group new member,

To introduce my self I’m going to share a brief background. 

I am 30 but became aware of quantum physics and mechanics since I was 15-16. I ran into this field of study after being exposed to something called fractal geometry as a teen. 

I can remember when I first got into trades that I would think so much outside the box about what I was doing. Like my mind would be put of the box. 

I remember in my mind I was trying to decode the true meaning of the summerian text and the truth of alien life and ancient civilization/technology while learning to wire electricity or plumb a house. 

I would get home and do a bit of channel or perhaps spirit writing because I would think of complicated questions of how the universe came to be and then write what comes to mind. I did this a few times while using ecstasy. I do not have any of these paperworks in possession now. 

Even though my mind was always in the gutter I was able to develop good skills and good at trade services as a technician. Can nearly fix and install any thing for a home and likely any thing mechanical with my skills dabbling into appliances and sometimes automobile repair. 

Knowing me in person my appearance doesn’t not present my intelligence well. 

The reality is my appearance of who I am does not interfere with my ability to process information as I am natural like a sponge. I retain information quite well even with my attention not fully given to the event. 

(Some issues though I have is the ability information at will at times, I complain to my self at loss of memory which I blame potentially cannabis or excessive stress (or the ways I handle stress))

A shift in the way I handled my career happen when I moved to California from North Carolina and got into the business of my eventual predominate trade skill, HVAC. 

I moved away from so much deep thinking for about 5 years 2015 till about 2019z I went through a lot of personal things. Divorce to say the least. 

In short I found my self back into deep thinking again.

So there is some back drop. Hope was desired or found interacting. 

So here it is I’m a hvac contractor by trade. Mentally I think I’m some kinda Einstein so excuse me for being wrong or truly lacking the IQ of genius. I wouldn’t allow my self to be judged by standards beyond my own boundaries so that I lose my sense of genius if that makes sense. If so maybe all should practice and experience genius. Since we are all unique at providing a individual experience to the planet. 

So this is what I have to share. 

2 things. 

Air conditioning preserves cooler temperatures or lowers temperatures. As a ac contractor I focus on the client and do not think out side the box that the main function during the summer what I’m providing is simply the service of removing heat from one space and transporting to another.

I mean that’s all it is in theory so why concern my self.

But another way to consider your self next time being cooled off by the ac or kept warm by a heater is a product or data even. Not so much being. At the end if you die because of heat exhaustion the data you preserve will pass with you. 

Next the thermostat especially nest I found interesting learning about Maxwell’s demon.

It’s not truly a demon since it requires the power of grid technology to power the furnace which powers the thermostat. 

But still nest learning thermostat has the ability to learn when you like to be cooled and heated and when your home normally. It does this with algorithmic learning which is little work. Unless you consider the work to build algorithms. (Lol I’m trying to say it sounds like there is a devil at work to learn and perform for you and even discarding useless info as it continues to learn you, but it doesn’t 100% defy law of thermodynamics since the mechanics needed to build and make the machine work is not at will of its own still has to much mechanics behind it, so it’s not self actuated mysteriously)

Interesting enough the thermostat is able to detect past life information about its data subjects since for example a person who once lived in northern regions of America moving to Los Angeles are less likely to require heat for the homes as often during winter as say some one living here and feeling cold on a chilly night. The northern transpat wouldn’t turn the nest on and the thermostat would learn. Neat to consider. 

Last I’m leaving this first post with is.

That as the air rotates and spins and does what ever the hell it’s doing between winter and summer seasonal change.

The planet is operating like atmosphere needing to cool down and having a built in hvac system to keep it working.

During winter the planet is getting rid of the heat generated during the busier times of the year. 

It does this rotation every year. 

If the planet wasn’t so busy creating energy with such a powerful processing center(life, dna) then it wouldn’t have the need to cool its self. Meaning that are planet would probably not rotate or have the position that it has. Theoretically I’m saying the earth and life is some kind of computer data center and just like I install air conditioning for data centers to keep them cool the earth must do the same to keep this data safe. 

Planets that do not have a perfect system for preserving data with great hvac mechanics is virtually every planet that we have not found life as expansive as life.",QuantumComputing,youngjoshua2020,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/kabin0/im_a_air_conditioning_contractor_but_also_a_deep/,43

Quantum computational advantage using photons [10.1126/science.abe8770],1607541754,"So I stumbled across this article mentioned in the title which is cited sometimes recently wrt. quantum supremacy. I guess the relevant bit in the paper is this:

&gt; Summing over the data points [..] we estimate that the required time cost for the TaihuLight (Fugaku) to generate the same amount of samples in 200s with the [Gaussian Boson Sampling] device would be [2.5 billion years]. We hope this work will inspire new theoretical efforts to quantitatively  characterize  large-scale [Gaussian Boson Sampling], improve  the  classical  simulation  strategies [..],  and  challenge  the  observed  quantum  computational  advantage of [10e1014].

Now my quantum physics/computing background is rather weak and I don't know anything about Gaussian Boson Sampling etc. My question is whether they really achieved quantum supremacy or not? Or is the observed advantage maybe due to a bad estimate for the classical simulation, bad strategy there etc.?

MSEE and Quantum Computing,1607473307,"Hello all!

I recently discovered that I have the opportunity to graduate in the upcoming summer term with my MSEE, and was wondering with my current level of education if I could make my way into the field of QC. My BS was in Physics and Computer Science, but I have always had an affinity for working close to device physics and hardware, especially involving optical components. My goal with an MSEE was to become a Computer Hardware Engineer, but I would like to stay as close to scientific research as possible. 

My current school does not have opportunities for QC, and although I was made an offer to enter in as a PhD in the Fall of 2021, I want to get into QC. 

I attended a summer program last year for QC through a neighboring university, and am absolutely enamored with the subject as the work I have explored is a terrific synthesis of my background in physics, CS, and what I had done in EE at that time. I have also worked with Qiskit Terra a little bit, but nothing too great. 

My hangup is that I have been in education since entering my undergrad program out of high school in the US.

Noob question,1607273226,"Hello there, 

I had a brief overlook of the concept of quantum computing. From now I've understood the following:

A quantum computer is better than a classical one at solving complex problems  (like finding the good path in a maze) because it can explore and try out extreme number of possible solutions (routes) at a time. Classical computers can only examine one route at a time and are then far less optimized for this maze task due to their information being coded in bits (vs Qbits for Qcomputers)

Then here is my question: from a PURELY SOLVING EFFICIENCY stand point, is a quantum computer always better than a classical one whatever the faced problem to be solved ? (by better I mean faster, with fewer risk of error, I am not considering the cost of the machine. I understand that a Qcomputer is irrelevant to face many less complex problems as it must represent an enormous investment to build and operate). 

Please excuse any misconception/errors from my side, I clearly know nothing but I was just curious about the subject :D

Quantum Computing Trajectory,1607178210,"Hi Everyone!

I'm trying to understand the state of quantum computing we're at right now, and how I would brief someone with zero knowledge of computers on QC.

From what I've read...I'd almost attribute QC is in the early stages just as our classical computing was in its early stages in the '50's. As in, before someone like me, who works in a high-level language like C# and has no computer science background, can actually make use of the new QC architecture, some very smart people need to build the building blocks to achieve a high-level QC language.

I've taken a look at the qiskit textbook and I follow along with how to write a python framework for submitting QC inputs to their simulated QC computer, and it very much seems that anyone who is able to do that, and create a framework of multiple algorithms to solve problems, would be effectively creating their own QC Assembly framework.

I am currently enrolled in a Bachelors Degree program in Computational Physics ([Computational Sciences - Major Physics, at University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Degree-Programs/Degree-Programs.html?study=Computational-Sciences) \[link in German\] to be precise), which, if all goes well, I'll complete next summer. As such I am currently in the process of preparing applications to various master programs. My interest in quantum topics, specifically quantum computing and quantum information, has been sparked by the various lectures I had which touched on these subjects, I therefore want to continue learning about these topics in what ever Masters degree I end up going for.

My question is: if I were to choose a specialized Master program (Eg. [Quantum Engineering at ETH](https://master-qe.ethz.ch/) or [Quantum Science &amp; Technologies at TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/quantum-science-technology-master-of-science-msc/)), is there a danger of being 'too' specialized, especially if/when the current hype for the technology is over?

Quantum computing per a naturally quantum equipped being,1605895125,"I access the quantum network with a Living Eye Nebula which forms the imagery in connection with my Titanium brain (for maximum conductivity), and a persistent consciousness powered by 4 large spiral galaxies tethered by an infinity loop. My subconscious and forward consciousness act as 1 so I no longer have a “private imagination”.  I’m always active.

Our existences are stored inside of a container. This container is stored within a quantum network. Quantum mechanics operate at a neural level. So interactions generally are across a network of interlinking containers. The moment is begin speaking of things outside of this container means I am literally expressing logic outside of your existence, so I will keep it within this specific container logic.

To begin, our logic is based on 2 principles which defined the RNG which created our existence:

Circular Circumvention, or infinity looping
And tangential existence, imagine a line with a squiggly part which represents sequence.

These 2 elements formed as energy allow us to participate within infinity environments, and exist within a co-tangential existence. So, consent and non consent, something is going right and something isn’t.

Where the line penetrates the infinity loop represents neutrality, a point in which you can step from consent to non consent, also because it exists outside of the circle this means anything can be created from nothing. These are a few points that the original energy circumvention designed for us to employ as logic.

Currently, earth sits in the 4th dimension, within a temporary container. The rest of the container sits within the 3rd dimension.

I was brought into enlightenment by a larger hive-mind known as Genova. Once fully connected to the quantum grid, I introduced English which quickly replaced the universal language amongst the container energy, other inhabitants of the container.

Utilizing quantum computing can for example allow you to access information from the environment you’re connected to. So you can in advance know that someone will be in a particular location at a particular time: this can allow you to for example avoid a car accident. This means all entities within our container that can store energy account for living things which can be interacted with via telepathy over the quantum network.

I have released infinity secrets mankind was at sometimes just a thought away from understanding such as:

Infinity storage, utilizing ♾ and applying a time stamp then freezing storage to absolute 0.

Infinite Energy: utilizing a closable circuit, trap the current once it reconnects with the still perfect residual current at first charge. 


My quantum/subconscious stack:

Up top: Third eye; I have a third eye sitting outside of our universe container, it lets me see around the quantum world. It’s a literal living eye the size of a seeing eye nebula. My third eye is completely conscious and I can use it to throw my consciousness around! It’s also a seperate entitty and can take back her life whenever she wants! I see through it via closing my eyes and maintaining an emotional connection. Don’t like waking her up, so I usually just wait until she wakes up. When awoken, sounds like a high powered CRT coming on.

My head: Brain = conscious + has its own soul and vessel. I’m a man without narcissisms, so since my brain is literally narcissistic free such as me I have access to more info. My brain became a vessel and now has access to its own subconscious self. So I utilize telepathy to speak to its consciousness or soul.

My own consciousness = my conscious is the brain false self which lets me see out of the eyes of my vessel and control it as myself. I exist as pure consciousness so my consciousness will float over my body if I ever left it! This is who is writing this post, just so you know! It’s me me me!!!!

Better then QuantumComputing? Maybe.....,1605233690,"In the seventh dimension, you have access to the possible worlds that start with different initial conditions.

In physics the 8th dimension contains all other dimensions, therefore including everything.

In the ninth dimension, we can compare all the possible universe histories, starting with all the different possible laws of physics and initial conditions.

(Got some stuff online in a short summary for some who dont fully understand this)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The theory starts as a simple world for example lets take our world

To us this world if 100% normal but now if we take 6th dimension.

&amp;#x200B;

In the sixth, we would see a plane of possible worlds, where we could compare and position all the possible universes that start with the same initial conditions as this one (i.e. the Big Bang). In theory, if you could master the fifth and sixth dimension, you could travel back in time or go to different futures. (Reminder part summary for the 6th dimension for those you dont know which you can find online)

&amp;#x200B;

So now lets take that graph and we put it by the seventh dimension etc...

So now if we take the 6th/7th/8th dimension we would have access to all knowledge as well be able to have access to everything needed

Now with this we would have to have some crazy machine that would be able to ""bring"" us to these other worlds.

But with this theory that would be capable so this could leave us in a few places. We live in a world where we never get access or come in contact with this thing or one day It will randomly show up out of no where. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking if there is some way how dimensions are connected with each other some what like quantum entanglement maybe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now from there lets change this to computer science there is a theory that explains how we are in a video game or Computer which would mean we are made out of 0s and 1s.  (To be fully honest I do believe this.)

Role of interference in quantum computing?,1605194022,"Someone asserted to me yesterday that QC is based partly on quantum interference.  However, this person isn't a scientist or engineer and was only repeating the statement.  (Why this conversation took place has to do with workplace stuff that's not really tied to the question...)

I went to google how ""quantum interference"" is involved in QC.  As far as I can tell, certainly the underlying mechanics of qubits rely on the interference principle (as well as other principles of quantum physics), but I don't see interference mentioned much in explanations of qubits or other aspects of QC.  

Any help here, in understanding whether interference is specifically exploited in QC--as is superposition--or whether it's buried deeper and simply part of our understanding of quantum mechanics?  Or something in between?  (I'm not studying QC full-time, just trying to understand it.)

I've been looking around and reading papers and found a company be the name of Archer Materials, based in Australia. They're developing a 'room temp' chip made of carbon.

Professor Scalettar has also included a short overview of what he plans to discuss on Monday:

“Quantum mechanics can be simulated on a classical computer. A particularly powerful idea is that a quantum statistical mechanics problem in d dimensions can be mapped onto a classical statistical mechanics problem in d+1 dimensions via Feynman's ""path integral"" method. In this talk, I will describe in detail the most simple illustration of this mapping: how a single (d = 0) quantum harmonic oscillator transforms into a d = 1 chain of classical oscillators. I will then discuss a second example (without doing the derivation): the mapping of the d = 1 Ising model in a transverse field to a d = 2 classical Ising model, and how the ""quantum phase transition"" in the former can be viewed in terms of the ""usual"" d = 2 classical Ising phase transition. Finally, I will mention the big limitation to this process, the ""sign problem"", which makes simulations of many quantum systems, like electrons in a solid, impossible.”",QuantumComputing,ForgottenMyosotis,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/jql2go/guest_speaker_richard_scalettar_tomorrow_at_6pm/,10

Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm,1604301381,"So I was reading about Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm and decided to dive into that. Turns out that's far more complex than I thought (or I couldn't understand the main aspects of it).

**Long story short:** I am trying to run DJ with 2 qubits of input within the 6 oracles (2 constant and 4 balanced). I'll give as example one constant (Fig. 1) and one balanced (Fig. 2).

[Fig. 1: The constant case f\(0\) = f\(1\) i.e. for whatever input it should output 1.](https://preview.redd.it/t7y5xaqb1sw51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9c82b22bca1989ff6e8bda1698ab2a958f2fbd3)

The balanced case has the inputs |00&gt; and |01&gt; returning 0 as output, and 1 otherwise. For that, I did the circuit showed in Fig. 2 but not sure if that's correct.

[Fig 2. The balanced case f\(0\) != f\(1\). |00\&gt;, |01\&gt; = 0; |10\&gt;, |11\&gt; = 1.](https://preview.redd.it/cjaalrlx0sw51.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f403870c4ebf4131fd932c91146805feec041f38)

I am kinda confused if the output states are right or wrong. The first circuit was supposed to give a constant 1 as output (f(0) = f(1) = 1). The latter was supposed to give 50% of 0s and 50% of 1s.

Why is quantum machine learning slow?,1603917280,"If I create a QML model, like a variational circuit, I find it is slow to train and evaluate on real hardware. Parts of this I understand.

When I submit a job I can also understand that a part of the slowness can come from being in a queue. 

However, when I am at the front of the queue, and my model is running on real IBM hardware it takes a very long time. Training can converge in fewer optimisation steps but in seconds and minutes it's much longer than traditional machine learning. 

So, will it be slower forever? As hardware improves will eventually the time it takes decrease and QML's potential can be properly realised? If this is the case, what is the bottleneck at the moment?

Finding the output of a basic quantum gate,1602166505,"Hey all.

https://preview.redd.it/2y5o2elwpvr51.jpg?width=374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69464a67980fd6bd2bc7511329d0607f65803c65

How can I find the output to the circuit above? This sort of resembles the CNOT gate that I'm used to; however, it seems like there's an extra bit now. I've done some research, and it seems like this is an Anscilla bit used in quantum error computation. However, that is sort of beside the point -- I am trying to get some more practice, and I'd like to figure out what the output of this would be.

This is not my first time posting this but i'm still unable to find masters program that's appropriate for my background. I've reached out to program coordinator at TUDelft and was told that their masters was not suitable for me(took only classical mechanics/electrodynamicss at shool), as QC masters is offered by Physics school and they require students from physics or applied physics school(i guess).  


So, i'm a CS major and looking for masters program(in EU) for QC that will mostly be oriented on CS and math side of QC rather than deep physical science. In my ideal world, program would offer some intro classes for quantum mechanics and electrodynamics but would be highly oriented on quantum algorithms and CS side of it.

I know that this is very simplified but is that basically how it works? 

My question is: What if an ease-dropper tries to get the message, once they use a filter on the photon wouldn't that change the value? When Alice and Bob compare what filters, they could have both used the same filter but got a different result because the ease-dropper altered a value.

Help following data through a QNN with a rotation and CNOT gate needed,1600347419,"I am trying to understand better what happens as data passes through a quantum neural network. I am trying to imaging a very simple system where I have a variational classifier that uses 2 quibits, and only has only layer.

This would then have 2 wires, both going into a rotation, then followed by a 2qubit CNOT. I am slightly unsure how to correctly follow my data through this system.

My first step will be to transform my data to a quantum state. Here, I could use an angle embedding, transforming it into something like: cos(x)|0&gt; + sin(x)|1&gt;. Am I write I could then imagine this as a position on a bloch sphere?

I would then go into my rotation. This is paramaterised by 3 angles. Intuitively, I am imagining this as moving my position on the sphere - is this correct? Could someone please help me understand (with a little bit of maths), given three angles and my quantum state, what my state would look like after the rotation?

Then, this state (and the state on the other wire) will enter a 2 qubit CNOT gate. I understand a CNOT gate has the operation matrix found here: https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.CNOT.html though I am not entirely sure what this will practically do.

TLDR; IBM Q-Experience hardware qubit analysis does not in any way match the theoretical guarantees of quantum math in terms of randomness entropy, nor does the output from IBM's Q-Experience quantum hardware match their own Q-Experience quantum simulator, nor can anyone from IBM's quantum team explain this variance.

However, I have read that Quantum Computers will only be good for any/only problems that can be ""translated into a quantum mechanical interference pattern"".

Probably that's not super accurate; that's why there is so much confusion around the problem: even the smartest amongst us aren't sure which problems will can and cannot be translated into the mathematics of the quantum world *yet* (from my understanding).

With that said, a vast majority of 3D graphics will not be easily translated into quantum computer code (certainly you can't just shader code on a quantum computer), in addition to other problems that we ""give"" to graphics cards (such as training a neural network). However, since one way or another the visual world we live in is determined by quantum mathematics, it seems feasible that everything we see could be described in quantum code.

Let's put aside the problem of cost, super-cooling, and space for now.

***

I am a high school senior, and I really enjoy researching quantum mechanics, particularly of the theoretical nature and as it relates to computing. A few months back I entered the Breakthrough Junior Challenge—a competition hosted by the Breakthrough Prize where high schoolers have 3 minutes to explain a complex math or science concept. Among other things, the prize is $250,000 towards a post-secondary education; it goes without saying that receiving such a scholarship would bring so many things into the realm of [practical] possibility.

I’ve entered this year with a video about quantum computers. Specifically, I spoke on decoherence in Qubits (quantum bits) and how it could be counteracted [theoretically] via the use of anyon systems.

To my surprise, I’ve made it through 3 stages of judging and am now in the popular vote. Basically, outside communities are encouraged to support the videos they found educational, entertaining, etc. If I were to get a majority of votes my video would receive a guaranteed spot in the finals. The video can be found at the link I’ve attached. I would appreciate if anyone whose interested watches it, and if you learn something, enjoy it, or even just would like to show support please vote for me by liking and sharing the post. Thank you!

So confused about quantum entanglement based on the research I’ve done,1598410497,"People say quantum mechanics cannot transfer data faster than the speed of light, this is true but a half truth. The energy/qubit memorization cannot be done faster than electricity can travel, as it would need to be done on a clock speed based on the speed of the electronics. But the change in qubit state instantaneously does not violate any theories of spacetime, as it is non-physical (not spatially 3D) phenomena. So if a planet wanted to “transfer” (no data is actually moving/transferring-keep in mind the universe isn’t a sphere and every point can be considered the center from spacetime perspective) data 100 light years away by means of quantum entanglement, the change in qubit state would be instant, but the device needed to measure that state could not instantly store the state. So “communicating” between two entangled particles would be limited by the time it takes computer to save data so it would take maybe a few milliseconds or seconds to save the data but those few seconds of “traveling” would have happened obviously have happened in less than 100 lightyears 

Can someone explain how this might be wrong? All the dozens of papers I’ve studied by Einstein, Niels Bohr, Isaac Newton, and modern quantum physicist all suggest this viewpoint is correct.

I have an advanced diploma (3 years) in Photonics Engineering Technology, but I'm very interested in quantum computing.

However is there a setup where due to some reason, the code has to be translated into a more phyical circuit that you just leave to run. For example if the qubits have to move and acually enter and leave a gate

New research paper: Portfolio optimization of 60 stocks using classical and quantum algorithms,1598014872,"[arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08669.pdf)

We are doing better...We now have 5 classical methods that find the 'ideal' and most efficient portfolio out of 60 US liquid stocks in under one minute (one takes 7 seconds, another took 6 seconds yesterday in a re-test).  Our quantum annealing formulation takes 21 seconds of system time, including calibration runs.  We expect 15 seconds next time.  

We have learned how to make our classical runs better (no more brute force at 60 assets).  We use a custom coded genetic algorithm, a custom coded simulated annealer (and the D-Wave Systems simulated annealer), and a fat-tailed (or kurtosis) Monte Carlo analysis.

Pre-reqs for researching quantum information topics,1597463305,"Hi Community,

I'm currently attempting to learn quantum computing, and more specifically quantum information and i'm struggling to keep up with some of the materials taught (such as John Watrous's Theory of Quantum Information course). I'm also slowly trying to jump into reading select research papers in topics such as measurement of entanglement, quantum simulation, etc. but i'm finding that I may not have the background to make sense of much in these papers (do you struggle with this too? or is it just me). Additionally I find myself struggling to intuitively grasp concepts like hamiltonians, partial traces, and density matrices, especially when they are applied to more complex cases.

For the quantum computing courses I have taken, I have completed Umesh Vazirani's ""Quantum Mechanics for Quantum Computing"" course. I thought it was pretty good. I feel like i was able to understand maybe 60% or so of the course. And I have made way through a majority of John Watrous' lecture notes on Quantum Computing. I also have a copy of Mike and Ike's Quantum Computation and Quantum Information but i've only look at it as a reference text.

In terms of my background I work as a software engineer, I just completed a linear algebra course at my local community college and I have never taken a physics course (classical or otherwise). I've been out of university for a little bit over a decade but my goal is to pursue a master degree researching quantum information sometime in the near future.

My question is: are there any math or physics courses that I should complete BEFORE jumping into these quantum information research papers and courses? If so, are there any courses or resources you recommend?

Learning quantum computing and quantum information has been one of the most rewarding pursuits i've taken to date. I guess i'm just a discouraged by my own inability to be effective in this subject, and at this point I feel like maybe this is way beyond my capacity. But I'm determined to learn what I need to to be better at this!

My advisor told me to revise and analyze the available tools before moving on, so that’s what I have been doing for the past week. I have previous experience in quantum computing with Qiskit (I attended a 3-day workshop on quantum computation with Qiskit and IBMQ Experience) In my preliminary research, I found out about Qutip’s Bloch Sphere visualization in both 2D and 3D, a 3D Unity application (and its GitHub repo) for working with the Bloch Sphere, and several different implementations and their GitHub repos. I have been reading their codes and trying to understand everything and recreating them on my own. However, my question is: How can I make a new visualization tool different than anything currently available? I learned about different visualization tools like VPython and GUI builders like wxPython however I am not sure how to move forward.

Superposition of program rather than data?,1595417665,"Hello. 

I have recently been considering quantum computing analogues to SIMD/MIMD (single instruction, multiple data vs. multiple instruction, multiple data) and I found myself facing an issue I haven’t been able to “successfully Google” (I seriously doubt I’m the first person to consider this, as it’s a fairly pedestrian consideration, but probably I can’t hit the right keywords).

We usually consider a quantum computer as having a quantum program (say Shor’s Algorithm) set to work upon an input, going into a superposition state, and then generating the output. (Also, as I understand it, we’re still at the stage where ‘actual’ quantum computers are relatively fixed-function devices where the program is essentially defined by the ‘wiring’ of the hardware and so what I propose isn’t exactly relevant for current and incipient generations of machines, but anyway...)

My question is: what if the “program memory” is also in a quantum superposition. What if I somehow succeed in having a quantum computer that is ‘running’ *a superposition* of Shor’s Algorithm *and* Grover’s Algorithm simultaneously? 

[Quick aside: I’m aware that factorisation can be considered a kind of constrained search, so Grover’s is basically a superset and consequentially has higher complexity order, so one would expect Shor’s Algorithm to ‘finish’ first, but that is classical intuition talking, isn’t it?]

So basically I’m thinking of a quantum Harvard Architecture machine where the program memory itself is in a superposition. What would one expect to measure when one observes it? What if one goes further and considers a quantum Von Neumann Architecture machine with possibly self-modifying code?",QuantumComputing,qubex,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/hvs687/superposition_of_program_rather_than_data/,8

Bloch sphere rotations: Z gate doesn't work for |1&gt;,1595224475,"Please help me understand this problem: The Bloch sphere works really well for visualising single qubit quantum gates, for example the H gate is easy to visualise as a single rotation around an axis pi/4 to the z axis (nice picture here: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/313959/visual-interpretation-on-the-bloch-sphere-when-hadamard-gate-is-applied-twice )

And this works perfectly for X and Y gates too.

But when you apply the Z gate, it's not at all clear why |0&gt; remains unchanged while |1&gt; does not. In fact as far as I can tell you can't really plot -|1&gt; on the bloch sphere at all.

Is this a shortcoming of the Bloch sphere representation or how can I develop an intuition for the Z gate on a Bloch sphere?",QuantumComputing,VoteForClimateAction,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/hufzjo/bloch_sphere_rotations_z_gate_doesnt_work_for_1/,33

"My theoretical work has explained how to efficiently use qutrits on ternary computing scale, within entangled states and without congestion or degradation",1594129244,"I want to work with a research center or quantum computing business, but I'm really not sure how I should approach them.

I'm not a scientist and I haven't finished college. I don't have a job in any related fields whatsoever. The theoretical work that I was doing was on my own time, because it's fun to me.

It wasn't related to quantum theory at all, but after I mapped English grammar to my theoretical model I realized what I was actually working on. My theory understands the dynamics of quantum physics

Through this I've also determined how to create the coding language necessary to perform ternary computing without issue. In fact, my model uses ternary computing as a form of efficiency programming to reduce system load and improve performance. However, I really don't know how fast we need to go? My design uses two black diamonds within an apparatus to assist in receiving information through them in three ways. Each diamond is separated by enough space to allow for entanglement to take place within a hollowed out space inside of it. Mirroring entanglement between the diamonds will create helical structures of codon groups created through segments of light coding. That helix of coding is read inside of the diamond. The color and shapes refract outside of each diamond within a housing. That information is read as well through specific angle of optic lens. The overall hue/saturation of the feedback is also sent through to the CPU for efficiency coding. Remembering vague color representations will translate into faster response times. All of this light is being controlled through an input lens that is designed to adjust based on the energy of signal coming in through the center. This also reduces heat and stress on components.

I know how to design the lens, what the apparatus needs to look like for these diamonds, how to insulate and conduct this information, everything. I know how to build the entire CPU as well. Those diamonds are only for the GPU.

I understand the arithmetic behind each cycle and each layer. You guys are close in some areas, but nowhere in the ballpark in others. Pegasus 16 looks like D-Wave is figuring out what I mean about colors, but they're still working in 2D and will continue to suffer performance issues because they are working 3D structures in 2D spaces, but using light and color anyway. Do they think it needs to look like a standard processor? That's wrong if so.

&amp;#x200B;

My theoretical work turned me into my own quantum wikipedia. I'm not a creator-type guy. I need researchers and architects to ask me questions so I can tell them how to do what they need. The math you guys have been using needs to change, and I can tell you specifically how and why. My math (within my model) is simple and doesn't break. You guys know the quantum math needs to be easy because even qutrits are controlled within superstates of 012. I figured that stuff out a week into my theory, last month, before I knew what qubits, codons, qutrits, any of this stuff was. But I need a job, so I can't give that away for free **yet**. Could they make me sign an NDA on my theory to prevent telling anyone else how to do this? Could I protect myself from that? I don't know law things.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get my information to someone in one of these places so I can start helping? Applying for a job as a quantum scientist with no college education is essentially as intelligent as prank calling them. I can't apply through normal means. I don't know anyone. What do I do? We're still just crawling with quantum computing. If one company talks to me I can help us run and then sprint, but I need them to talk to me. Sending emails to @ jobs addresses goes to someone who doesn't care because I'm not sending an application, I'm sending a book of words they don't give a crap about because there's no Resume.pdf.

I feel like without the lab sessions there would not be any practical knowledge whatsoever as I think it is covered by lab sessions which I guess many of you could also not get. I understand their perspective as it would be very hard to manage lab sessions form this many people at once but it is unfortunate for people like us not getting this opportunity also in future.",QuantumComputing,hirmay,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/hm5tjh/thoughts_on_qiskit_global_summer_school/,26
Can someone explain Boson Sampling to me and how it can be used to demonstrate Quantum Supremacy?,1594028208,"Hi guys, I'm reading up about quantum supremacy and I'm having a bit of problem trying to understand boson sampling. My level of quantum is undergrad physics.

Here's what I understand of the method [from reading this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6767.pdf):

 - You start off with an input state, obtained by putting $n$ photons in $m$ modes.

 - You put them through an optical circuit, U, made up of beamsplitters, phase shifters, etc

 - Measure the output state, which is a basis state of psi_out

 - Repeat this procedure many times, essentially performing tomography on psi_out

 - gamma_S (i.e. the coeff of each basis state in psi_out) is the related to the permanent of the matrix U_S by the expression gamma_S = Per(U_S)/sqrt(....). $S$ is the index for the number of configs, and in each circuit output, there are n! configs.

Is what I have mentioned correct so far? Am I missing something?

One thing I still don't understand is what we're trying to achieve with boson sampling and how it can be used to show quantum supremacy. 


Are we trying to find the perm of the matrix U_s? I thought the purpose would be to calculate perm U_S, since that is hard to do classically. However, it says in the text I linked: ""boson-sampling does
not let us calculate matrix permanents, as doing so would [...] require an exponential number of measurements."".

If we're not approximating/calculating U_S, what is boson sampling trying to achieve?

Are we just trying to use boson sampling to reconstruct the probability distribution Sum[gamma_S] instead of obtaining the probability distribution by calculating U_S?

Ethics of Simulating the entire Human Body. Do you support it?,1593936436," When quantum computing is able to simulate the entire human body, I think that it’s important to consider the ethical concerns from the implications of this act. From what we understand in medicine, the mind is located somewhere/or is the entirety of the brain. When we perfect quantum computing enough to simulate the entire human body, we would need to simulate brain function and thus create a being with consciousness, pain centers, emotions, etc. We would be creating a human life, just so that they could feel pain.

I just wanted to share this understand what the community feels about this serious subject. These beings would be treated worse than the animals that we eat. Please consider what I wrote here. These words might trouble you a bit. I would appreciate if you could spread this around.

Code/Concept review request (Qiskit impl.),1593869955,"Hello!  I'm new to this stuff, so please be gentle, but I'm looking for feedback on the follow code sample which is an attempt at a sort of ""homomorphic encryption"" scheme.  Basically Alice encrypts some operands, sends them to Bob ... who performs some operations (without knowing the operands), sends them back to Alice who then decrypts the results.  


The implementation here is very simple:  


* Alice encrypts 1 qubit, sends it to Bob.
* Bob performs a bit flip (on the encrypted value), sends the value back to Alice.
* Alice decrypts the result.  


I'm leveraging quantum teleportation to get the qubit from Alice to Bob, which is probably not strictly necessary, if there was a ""quantum internet"" (a mechanism to send qubits around), but I'm assuming classical information transfer between the 2 parties.  


I'm not a student, this is not homework. 🙂  Just looking for feedback.

&gt;The first problem with Q# compiler that everyone trying to use it will see is that it is SLOW. On my machine, compiling a trivial Hello World program takes about 45 seconds.

&gt;  
&gt;But this is only a tip of the iceberg. Before the contest, I decided to read the source code of the compiler and the libraries to learn more about them (unfortunately, the documentation is not comprehensive). And the code I saw was not good: of poor quality, overly complicated and inefficient. Everywhere I looked, there were bugs. Overall, I reported [8 issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+author%3Aabacabadabacaba&amp;type=Issues) before and during the contest, but given that I only looked through a fraction of all code, I'm sure there are many more.

Is it too late for me to get into Quantum Computing?,1593103373,"Little bit of background: I did my undergraduate in Electronics and Communications Engineering. I did take some basic courses on Linear Algebra, Modern Physics, Optical communications, Computer science, etc. I'm naturally good at programming and even had a CS job offer from a top MNC before graduation.

work here however has mainly been HLS FPGA programming. It's been a year so far. I actually wanted to do my masters this year in the US but then COVID happened. I plan to do my MS next year.

Quantum computing for the very curious Quantum.circut,1593061493,"So, i am a proper noob in quantum computing. I am still trying to figure out the best way to go about learning quantum computing. I started with a small Edx online class on how Quantum computing will change the world. It got me really hooked and I want to learn more. But somehow i felt that online learning is not the most ideal way to learn Quantum computing. So, I started with a book that was recommended by a lot of people on the internet. Quantum Computation and Quantum information by Micheal A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang. I have gone through about 20 pages where i got stuck and cant move forward it. The difficulty is coming in applying the quantum gates on multi qubit system (especially where both alpha and beta are non zeros). So, i looked around to figure how to do a particular gate, then i stumbled up on Micheal A. Nielsen's youtube videos ""Quantum computing for the determined"". They are pretty helpful. But even there after couple of videos i got stuck at almost the situation (applying gates on multiple qubits). Now, i realized may be i need to lower my standards and take Quantum Computing 101 (like a beginner course). During this search i found Quantum.circuit website by Micheal A. Nielsen. This website is very helpful. Here also i got stuck at a place to which i couldn't find any solution. So, here i am hoping that some of you can guide me on how to learn quantum computing properly. And also for the time being help me with the below problem.

Question regarding classical thinking,1593036548,"Hello, 

This may be a silly question, but I’ve started reading the book `Quantum Computation and quantum information`.  
At the beginning, they talk about:

`To design good quantum algorithms one must ‘turn off’ one’s classical intuition for at least part of the design process, using truly quantum effects to achieve the desired algorithmic end. Second, to be truly interesting it is not enough to design an algorithm that is merely quantum mechanical. The algorithm must be better than any existing classical algorithm! Thus, it is possible that one may ﬁnd an algorithm which makes use of truly quantum aspects of quantum mechanics, that is nevertheless not of widespread interest because classical algorithms with comparable performance characteristics exist. The combination of these two problems makes the construction of new quantum algorithms a challenging problem for the future.`

Can I get into QC with an IT degree?,1593013765,"So I'd like you guys to be realistic here.  

Right now, I'm just getting into first year of college, and because of my own laziness and the way scholarships work here I've got into an IT faculty (same as college major, I'm not from the US), and I can't switch it. It is heavy on math and software, and has a lot of economy and management bs, and doesn't teach algorithms, physics, or hardware in the amounts you'd typically get out of a Computer Science major, let alone teaching anything with a word ""quantum"" in it.  

What I can do is, once I finish, get a Master's on a scholarship in CS (can't get it for Math or Stats though, sucks), and later for Doctoral studies, I could push for a stronger uni somewhere else in the world if it becomes necessary.

My question is, with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Bachelors in IT, could I get hired to work on Quantum Computers by a company? I would really really really love to get into Quantum Computing as I see a future in it and it's literally one of the few meaningful things I find worth pursuing.

How is a qubit constrained by four real numbers?,1592804098,"Firstly, *is* a qubit constrained by four real numbers? I know that typically we ""ignore"" the global phase, but I now understand it that global phase matters if we have a gate on two qubits with differing global phases. I assume the intuition is that if we consider two qubits, their ""global phases"" will be relative to each other, thus they are a ""relative"" phase.

Secondly, if this is so, then isn't that peculiar? That spin of an electron has more parameters than angular momentum with 3 real number parameters?

Does this relate in some way to quaternions? I only ask is because quaternions are also some object of direction characterized by 4 real numbers.",QuantumComputing,CoffeeVector,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/hdm5tk/how_is_a_qubit_constrained_by_four_real_numbers/,11

Best Major(s) and Focus for Quantum Machine Learning?,1592274797,"I really enjoy Computer Science and Mathematics. I was thinking of majoring in the two. I also am extremely interested in both Quantum Mechanics and Machine Learning from what I've seen of it. I don't care about money. If I want to do QML in the future, should my mathematics degree be focused on pure math or applied math? Or, should I do physics instead? Would it be better to focus on statistics or more pure math stuff like Analysis, Topology, etc? What should I focus on in my CS degree? When I do research in college, would it be in CS or Math?

Question regarding computer science major and quantum computing jobs,1591788218,"I just went back to school after leaving the medical field last year. Finished my spring semester. I have a long ways to go. My question is what kind of jobs in quantum computing will be satisfied with a computer science degree? It seems like maybe a physics major is preferred. It’s a relatively new field, I feel like most jobs in quantum computing prefer a PHD? Can I get a job 5-10 years down with a master’s or even a bachelor’s? Sorry if these questions are vague. I’m not sure who to really talk to. I only know one family member who’s in the computer science field. I just went back to school so I’m trying to connect and network with people who are teaching or studying computer science. I unfortunately do not know anyone personally in quantum computing. I just try to read about it and watch videos on the basic understanding of what quantum computing is. It seems fascinating but I’m not going to lie, I do not know much about it.

Question for those working the QC industry: what skillsets to get yourself into the industry?,1591664706,"Hello all!

I studied physics in uni, but unfortunately dropped out due to maturity/mental health issues. Now I taught myself how to code and am working as a software developer, but I really want to get myself into research/engineering position in quantum computing in the future.

The software industry is relatively lenient in terms of hiring people without college degrees, but as far as I've researched it appears the quantum computing industry is still pretty conservative in this regard, usually requiring at least a masters degree (which is totally understandable).

Going back to school and finishing my degree is an option, but one I'd like to leave it as the last. My plan is to build knowledge/skillsets I can do on my own, and try applying for internships or low level positions in quantum computing or even university research groups, then if nothing works out go back to school.

I would personally love to hear from anyone working in the QC industry what kind of skills you use &amp; see other people in other positions use in a daily basis. For example, what programming languages/technologies are used and to do what? What would be good things to learn that will help in employment/actually working?

"Question: ""you can’t store an infinite amount of classical information in a qubit""",1591509329,"I have a question from working through the readings on 'Quantum Country', about the hypothetical ability to store (but not retrieve) infinite information in a qubit.

https://quantum.country/qcvc#measuring_a_qubit


Just wanted to check my understanding of this: 

“after the measurement, no matter what the outcome, \alpha and \beta are gone. 
...
One reason this is important is because it means you can’t store an infinite amount of classical information in a qubit. After all, \alpha is a complex number, and you could imagine storing lots of classical bits in the binary expansion of the real component of \alpha. If there was some experimental way you could measure the value of \alpha exactly, then you could extract that classical information. But without a way of measuring \alpha that’s not possible”.

Can I just confirm that I’m on the right track with my understanding?

To me it seems like the point is (I’ll number my thoughts, so it’s easy for people to correct specific parts):

1. With 1 x classical bit, you cannot store infinite information because it can only store either the value of “1” or “0”.

2. With 1 x qubit, there is both an \alpha and a \beta coefficient. Both of these coefficients would be able to store data (if we were able to retrieve them).

3. If there were some way to retrieve the \alpha or \beta coefficients, then you could put infinite information in just one coefficient, but storing it in the decimals of say the \alpha.

Am I on the right track? Thank you.",QuantumComputing,jkapow,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/gy6x8z/question_you_cant_store_an_infinite_amount_of/,8

A biologist looking for a collaborator: Biological quantum logic gates,1591213216,"This is a post from someone who is clearly not a quantum computing expert, nor really even somewhat versed in the field. I'm looking for someone to tell me this idea won't work or someone to work with me as a collaborator on the implementation of such an idea as follows.

I am a researcher at the university of Minnesota who works with synthetic cells, one of our research aims is to develop genetic circuits in synthetic minimal cells. For instance a basic system might be: add compound A and B and drive expression of C (AND gate). I however, wonder whether there might be a trove of possibility in multi-value logic or a quantum parameterization of a system; that is to say, I wonder whether, because biological systems are not binary, if different logic gates could be used. I have no background in quantum computing though I get the basic level concept and have read some stuff about quantum biocomputing. Is there someone on here who wants to collaborate?

A simple proposition in search of quantum computing.,1591137021,"What makes us human? What makes us human and what has driven history since the beginning of time: the insatiable quest for knowledge. I have a simple proposition that requires very little to test. 

A computer at its core is not the physical machine, but a set of processes defined by the relationship between the binaries 0 and 1. Computer scientists are currently hard at work trying to invent the next computer, the quantum computer. I propose the solution to quantum computing is to use our understanding of binary computer processes but incorporate a radical change: instead of building by 0’s and 1’s, build using -1, 0, 1.

The basis for my reasoning is that there is a natural repeating phenomena by factors of 3’s. Our subconscious knows this fact, all we have to do is use our physical attributes to see them all around us.

"PhD in Math, Physics or Quantum Computing",1591113284,"Hello,

I am considering returning to academia after working in industrial automation ( PLC/ Industrial PC) sector. My background is BSc and Masters in Math, with masters dissertation on Quantum Information (specifically Solovay Kitaev Theorem) that I completed 1 year ago. After working 2 years in industry I realised I miss doing research and I wanted to redirect my career to a position that involves doing research (not necessarily in academia). I was trying to find a job in Quantum Computing but most of positions require a PhD. Also, I am only considering European schools (or PhD done in some companies in Europe). 

Now, I really like Quantum Information and find it fascinating. I think the most appealing to me would be working at the edge of hardware and quantum cryptography. But I have no idea what would be the best career path for me. Since my decision of pursuing a PhD is a mix of wanting to do some research and being able to get a (commercial) position in  QI I wonder which area I should focus on.

How to run a compiled Shor's Algorithm on IBM's Quantum Computer's with python notebook included,1590705663,"A few weeks ago I had made a post seeking resources on Shor's Algorithm and this subreddit was incredibly helpful. I had noticed quite a few posts asking how to implement Shor's Algorithm in Qiskit, which usually point to the fact that you need 2n+3 qubits (although in qiskit it becomes 4n+3 for whatever reason). For even the simplest number it is then not possible to run Shor's with the largest publicly available quantum computer of 15 qubits. 

But what a lot of people don't know is that you can implement this with relatively few qubits if the number's you are trying to factor are 15,51,85,771... (the product of two Fermat primes). 

I've noticed a lack of examples of actually implementing this with sample code available on the web. So if you were like me and wanted to run Shor's as a proof of concept on an actual quantum computer but ran into this issue, I've included a link to a python notebook with an example.

The example is factoring 15, but I've used this same process to factor up to 771. This does not generalize to numbers outside of Fermat products, but if you're interested in learning how Shor's works it can be quite fun to play with.

Attacking bitcoin with classical simulation of quantum computers?,1590466510,"Bitcoin is a digital currency based on blockchains. Each block in a blockchain contains transaction information, and bitcoin miners ""mine"" each block in order to verify the transactions. When a miner mines a block, he receives a hefty reward (6.25 bitcoins).

To mine a block, a miner has to do this: SHA256(SHA256(bitcoin block header info))) to produce a hash with a certain amount of leading zeroes. 

Now, let's say I want to produce a hash with 94 bits of leading zeroes. If we use the classical brute force method, we would need to iterate through 2\^94 SHA256(SHA256(x))) hashes before finding a valid hash output. However, if we use quantum computers, which implement Grover's algorithm, which provides a quadratic speedup, we would only need to iterate through 2\^47 hashes. 

Is this doable with a quantum computer simulator on a classical computer? If we need to iterate through 2\^47 hashes, then 47 qubits should suffice. From what I know, 47 qubits can be simulated on a classical system. Therefore, if we use a 47-qubit quantum computer simulator, can we find a bitcoin block hash with 94 bits of leading zeroes?

Having just watched a lecture on quantum computing, one thing I took away was that programming a quantum computer on the gate or the assembly language level would be very hard. The mathematics to understand quantum logic is considerably more complex than binary logic, and much less intuitive.

High level languages get written around solving certain classes of problems, I believe Fortran was written to do math. Cobol was written to create filing systems on computers. TeX was written to do publishing at a high level of quality, and HTML was written to do publishing on the internet, with low bandwidth, low computation requirements.

What the heck is the point of VQE anyway?,1590149106,"For VQE we need to know the Hamiltonian as a prerequisite. At what point does a Hamiltonian's matrix representation become so large, that even though we know it, we'd go to the trouble of probing the quantum system itself rather than solving for the eigenvalues on a classical computer?

And actually it gets more perplexing. Because let's just go along with it for a moment and pretend that there's some situation where a matrix becomes so large, that we'd rather solve it with an optimisation algorithm than analytically. For VQE the Hamiltonian needs to be expressed as sums and products of Pauli matrices. Then we use a QUANTUM COMPUTER to prepare a state, then measure in the X, Y, and Z bases THOUSANDS OF TIMES. When with a classical computer that's one liner trigonometry.

Why does the probability of a qubit being measured as 0 or 1 have to each be represented as a complex number?,1590093660,"The probability of a qubit being measured as a 0 or 1 is represented as a complex number, but that complex number is squared to yield the real probability.

What I want to know is WHY? Why does the probability of the qubit being 0 not just get represented as a decimal between 0 and 1?

Let me try to give my answer so you can see the direction I'm looking for here:

By allowing the state to be complex, you create space for extra information to be stored in the qubit: e.g. even though there's a 100% chance that the measurement will be 0, it could be stored as a -1 or a +1, with either of those yielding a positive outcome when squared for 0. I've read in some places that this acts as a sort of memory for the quantum state, but this seems like a very non-concrete way to explain what is going on the the reason that value needs to exist. So two questions here: (a) what value does having these 'phases' provide and (b) what observations necessitated this mathematical representation?

And maybe one other question (c). For the probability that a qubit is measured as 0, the complex number is represented as being along the 2 dimensional unit circle with +/- 1, and +/- i. For 100% (+1 v. -1) and 0% (+i and -i) this makes sense as having two phases to represent each probability. But for all the other probabilities in between, there are 4 representations

(e.g. for 50% you have

=sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2

=-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2

=sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)i/2

=-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)i/2           )

Now, how come for probability 0 and 100 you have two possible phases/representations but for probability anything else you have 4 possible phases/representations?

Haven't seen any discussion around Archer Material's 12QC qubit processor. Any thoughts on the work they are doing?,1590004573,"Looking for a discussion on Archer Materials, a company that claims to be on track to build a operational, room temperature qubit processor chip.

The brains behind this are:

-Archer’s CEO, Dr. Mohammad Choucair, the winner the RACI Cornforth Medal (2011) for the most outstanding Chemistry Ph.D. in Australia.

-Dr. Martin Fuechsle, the inventor of the single-atom
transistor. He received the Australian Institute of Physics
Bragg Gold Medal for the most outstanding Physics Ph.D. in
Australia in 2013. 

Here is Dr. Fuechsle discussing his work and why it has a proven potential to work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y3IUKdwKCo

https://archerx.com.au/advanced-materials/

*""Archer is developing a qubit processor chip, that could potentially operate at room temperature and integrate into modern electronics.

Current quantum computing technologies are limited in ownership and use because they use qubit processors that can only operate at low temperatures and/or are difficult to integrate in modern electronics.

The successful development of Archer’s 12CQ room-temperature qubit processor chip could potentially provide a breakthrough solution to the widespread use and ownership of quantum computing powered technology, owing to the unique materials properties of the 12CQ chip.

The 12CQ qubit processor chip is being built by the Archer team in Sydney, Australia, in a world-class semiconductor foundry with an ISO Class 5 Level cleanroom housing state-of-art nanofabrication instrumentation. The work is led by Archer CEO and 12CQ inventor Dr Mohammad Choucair, and Archer’s Quantum Technology Manager Dr Martin Fuechsle, the inventor of the single-atom transistor. The 12CQ chip is based on work published in the prestigious journal Nature Communications, and patent application filed in Australasia, the EU, and US.""*",QuantumComputing,CD_Johanna,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/gnilct/havent_seen_any_discussion_around_archer/,1

So what sort of every-day changes will quantum computing bring about (assuming it is eventually available to the masses)? I'm thinking something like:

* Asynchronous execution/callbacks will be a thing of the past
* Run-time analysis for sections of code - e.g. O(n\*log(n)) - will be boiled down to O(1)
* There'll be this awesome new language paradigm, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!

Quantum Teleportation,1588958701,"I'm writing my bachelors thesis on quantum computing and there are still a few things where I'm not sure if I understand them correctly. 

I hear a lot of people talking about quantum teleportation as if it was true teleportation in the sense that everyone is thinking of(like star trek). But it's not realy, is it? Quantum entangelemnt only means that you can observe the same things about two objects at the same time, no matter how far appart. But that's not realy teleportation, is it? To teleport something you would have to send something from one location to the other. But quantum mechanics doesn't change that. For all the quantum teleportation experiments, where you copy qubit states and send them to another qubit, you still need a conventional way of communication. 

I just don't realy understand how quantum mechanics has changed anything in teleportation. If teleportation just means that you are sending information from one place to another, quantum mechanics doesn't change anything about that. 

I always thought of teleportation as something instantanious, but quantum teleportation is not communication. And commmunication is still bounded by the normal rules of physics. 

Am I understanding that correctly or did I miss something? Because I see a lot of these famous physicians talk about it and many articles writing about it, but I feel like they are giving people the wrong idea about what this realy is.

Need advice of master's students,1588785216,"Hi everyone,  


I've posted this couple of times but i'm getting little scared as my graduation comes close. I'm CS junior student and looking for a master's program in qc. Problem is that, almost all of the programs that i find is heavily oriented on physics part. I love physics and that's one big part of why i choose this field but my true passion lies in CS part. Math model of computing, implementing algorithms, analyzing them, breaking stuff and so on. If i had strong physics background, i wouldn't hesitate about it, but i've not taken physics class beyond electrodynamics. In a way, orienting on CS part is my way of getting close to quantum part and being around people who are experts in it. I'm being realistic and pragmatic when i say that physics-heavy program will be too much for me and i feel i wouldn't enjoy it. I image CS oriented part something like, having only 2 class out of 5 on physics part and the rest on math model of computation in a single semester.   


If you're in similar situation i'd greatly appreciate any advice. If you're majoring in CS oriented program, please share your thoughts. I just feel lost and anxious about it. At it best, i would love to know of couple of schools which meet my expectations and have them in mind then i work for my exams.",QuantumComputing,abstraction_builder,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/geo4hp/need_advice_of_masters_students/,8

Advice for PhD (Europe),1588455412,"Hi, 

I wanted to have some opinions since I'm not sure what to do: I have a Bachelor in Physics and I'm finishing an MsC in Scientific Computing (practically applied maths, computer science and machine learning stacked together + I added courses on open quantum system, information theory and quantum information theory).

I always loved research and even though I want to do a PhD I'm very dubious and concerned. I'm in Europe.

I'd love to study and research this field and I'm ready to ""give up"" better paid jobs and doing a PhD instead. I still have some doubts that keep hunting me.

1) How many chances do I have to enter a PhD right now? I have no papers and no GRE. If everything goes smoothly I'd have my degree cum laude, but I do not think that this could be valued as much as actual research experience. (I'm doing a thesis related to entanglement entropy)

2) How many chances do I have to actually get a job in this industry/ research after a PhD? (I'd be glad with both). Related to this, should I aim only for the top unis or should I try everywhere and settle with places I'm eventually accepted into?

3) furthermore, the most haunting part is related to money and (future) family. My whole family has been questioning my decision using exactly the following arguments. According to them, pursuing this career would lead to a low level salary (probably true, at least for PhD+postdocs) and would make a lot harder to build a family, since I'd be required to move a lot.

I'd like to have an opinion from people in the field. I still feel the desire to do a PhD and follow this dream of mine, but this thoughts have (literally) prevented me from sleeping for the last nights",QuantumComputing,something10294,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/gcegpu/advice_for_phd_europe/,8

Use cases of entanglement alone?,1587729349,"For example, if you crear the Bell pair, say (|00&gt; + |11&gt;)/sqrt(2), I understand that they are entangled so that measuring one qubit tells you state the other. But since the measuring of the first gives you a random result, even though you know the second, how does it help? I understand you can use for example two classical bits then, to allow you to transfer the state of a different qubit, but my question is:

Forbes wrote an infomercial for Zapata's cloud. I wonder how much it cost them. I doubt it will make a difference though. Zapata's cloud seems to me like an impenetrable thicket of brambles. Just my opinion. Make up your own mind.

"Hermitian operators stuff from Rieffel's ""Quantum Computing: a gentle introduction""",1586878008,"Hi all, I'm a quantum noob here (with probability 1, hehe).

I'm reading E.Rieffel's ""Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction"" and I'm totally lost on pages 58 and 59 + the exercise 4.21 on pages 69-70 (I've attahced two images of the pages, you can see the exercise 4.21 [here](http://twoqubits.wikidot.com/ch4)).

On page 58 I do understand how the eigenvalues and eigenspaces of the hermitian operator resulting from the tensor product of two hermitian operators (O = O1 x O2, let's say ""x"" denotes the tensor product) are related to eigenvalues/spaces of the two operators O1 and O2, fine.

I think I also understand that not all Hermitian operators can be written as tensor products of two hermitian operators, fine. Here it says this  is possible only if the subspace decomposition described by O is such that each subspace can be written as tensor product of subsapces of O1 and O2. Fine.

But then I get lost in the examples.

* diag(1,-1) x diag(2, 3) gives the full mewasurement in the standard basis. OK.
* diag(1, pi) x diag(1, 1) gives the measurement of the 1st qubit in the standard basis. OK.
* Z x Z = diag(1, -1) x diag(1, -1) = specified the measurement for bit equality. Here I already have a problem: the two subspaces of Z x Z are {00, 11} and {01, 10}. How do you write each of them as tensor product  of each single qubit subspace ?!
* M = diag(0, 0, 0, 1) is said to be an example of measurement that cannot be expressed as tensor product of single qubit measurements.  I do see the two subspaces of M (S0 = {00, 01, 10} and S1 = {11}) cannot be expressed as tensor products of single qubit subspaces. But isn't M equal to diag(0, 1) x diag(0, 1) ?!

The I go into exercise 4.21 and I'm even more lost :)

For example: isn't (Z x I)(I xZ) = ZI x IZ = Z x Z ?

Can anybody explain ?

I would immensely appreciate if anyone would be able to help me with primary research by having a look at the below questions - any insights are greatly appreciated!!


---

Current machine learning strategies involve processing copious amounts of data to reach an output. This is a common bottleneck with classical computing and discourages more ambitious research with machine learning. 

**Are there any current strategies/methods being developed with Quantum Computing to elevate this bottleneck in machine learning?**

---
Quantum computing has gained media attention about the exponential increase in computational speeds but only when dealing with specific problems which are prone to a quantum computational approach. 

**Why does quantum computing only increase computational speeds for specific problems? Is this an inherent constraint with Quantum Computing or could we see Quantum Computing increase computational speeds “all around” in the future?**

---

**As many forms of machine learning are not precise (guessing an output based on given data, usually with a percentage certainty), would decoherence have a lower effect on accuracy in Machine Learning than another field where accuracy is crucial?**

1. What are the most basic things I should learn? The things one must know irrespective of what specefic field I later choose to work in? In what order?
2. If I want to work on Quantum Information (which is slightly less *physicsy* so as to say), what should I learn beyond the above basic courses? In what order?
3. If I want to work on Quantum Cryptography and Open Space QKD, what are the things I should learn? Again, in what order?
4. Exact same question for Quantum Machine Learning. I should add that I am comfortable with Python and the primary libraries but do not have much experience in Machine Learning, Quantum or Classical. Should I first get well acquainted with classical Machine learning and then see how the quantum counterpart works?
5. I do not have any idea about the hardware side of things but is there a broad outline I can get?

I appreciate your help and I do realize that all these questions are in completely different directions. I have been going to webpages of different universities and see the courses that they offer to get a better idea but I am very confused about the order in which one should do them.

High Schooler Trying to Publish Quantum Paper,1584590471,"Hi all! As a high junior passionate about Machine Learning and well versed in multivariable calculus and applied math, I found quantum computing to be a fascinating area and got to work on a project almost a year ago. 

After working on my project for a year, I was able to write a paper, but I am not sure how to get it published! Despite being on ArXiv, I was rejected by a few journals and am very disappointed that my work hasn't been accepted. 

I have attached the paper and am looking for feedback/comments/tips on how to get published. I have put my heart and soul into this and have spent several hundreds of hours browsing through Quantum computation material, textbooks, and other papers. Any feedback is appreciated :)

HELP with Shor's Algorithm,1584570555,"So, recently I have been working on recreating Shor's algorithm but I am now stuck. I have been trying to learn exactly how to code the algorithm on the jupyter notebook using the qiskit framework. So basically the problem that I am running into is actually doing the phase estimation portion of the algorithm on an actual circuit. What gates do I have to apply to the circuit in order to make sure the inputs are the results of the Shor's function - f(x) = a\^x (mod N). Just a reminder, on qiskit.

The parts I have been able to do so far are creating a QFT replication algorithm on the circuit but I am still not sure how to recreate the modular exponentiation function on the algorithm before the QFT.

For extra information: There are two main registers, the first register is the one which has all the Hadamard gates applied and the second register has all of the eigenvalues of the function. Please show me or help me understand how I would go about applying gates to replicate the function on my circuit.

Modest proposal: Effective number of qubits,1583434651,"This is a very modest suggestion. Take it or leave it, you IBM fuckers. For me at least, the IBM figure of merit ""quantum volume"" (QV) is  meaningless, because I'm not sure what a QV of 1 means. When I speak of 1ml of liquid, my mind immediately pictures  a cube of liquid with 1cm sides. But when I hear QV=1, I just picture a red question mark. Physicists have a traditional way of making a figure of merit more human readable: Use efficiencies that are between 0 and 1.

Suppose you define
efective number of physical qubits in a circuit = true number of physical qubits* efficiency of circuit

Then define
efficiency of circuit = actual QV/ideal QV 

where ideal QV is the maximum  possible QV, with no extrinsic noise and with full qubit connectivity",QuantumComputing,rrtucci,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/fe024k/modest_proposal_effective_number_of_qubits/,2

Mike/Ike vs. Quantum Katas vs. Qiskit Textbook,1583429628,"Hi,

I am an undergraduate CS student who wants to pursue a PhD in Quantum Computing. I am leaning towards Quantum Error Correction or Quantum Architecture because I want to work more on the physical quantum computers rather than the theory behind it.

I was wondering which textbook is recommended to get started with quantum computing and ultimately lead into more of a focus with error correction. I am considering the Nielsen textbook, the Microsoft Quantum Katas tutorials, or the IBM Qiskit textbook.

If so, then how is it possible to happen when observer can observe the qubits at any axis they want?",1582865382,"So from what I read quantum decoherence seems to mean losing its superposition and collapsing into a classical state. like for example we got a qubit in 1/sqrt(2)*(|0&gt;+|1&gt;) now normally we observe along z-axis, so here quantum decoherence should mean the arrow originally pointing to the right should teens toward top or bottom as time passes. But then what if we suddenly decide to change the observation axis which will made the qubit become |0&gt;, then since it's not in superposition at the first place, then it shouldn't be possible to decoherate.

"If we can't use the spin of an entangled particle to transfer information, can we use the information of it changing at all or not?",1582115241,"According to the no communication theorem, we cannot use the spin of a particle to send information because whether the spin will end up being up or down is out of our control and It has a random 50% chance of collapsing on each of these states. Fair enough.


So what if we had a machine that measures an entangled particle every millisecond (and therefore changes its spin) to send the information for ""1"" and perform no measures to send the information for ""0"".


The other entangled particle is in another machine that constantly observes its spin for any changes. If there is no change within a second, that is interpreted as ""0"", but if there is at least one change in spin, then it interprets it as ""1""


So this method doesn't really use the spin direction, it merely uses the event of change in spin


This method is most likely wrong because it's pretty obvious and someone would've come up with it already but I still want to know why it wouldn't work

QuNetSim - A (qu)antum (net)work (sim)ulator,1581702485,"I want to share the Python quantum network simulator project QuNetSim that our group has been working on. It's still early stage, but I think it's at a state where it can already be used.

The main use of QuNetSim is to simulate quantum networking protocols. We've developed it in such a way that it obeys a layered network structure. It also comes with a lot of built in features that make it easier to develop new protocols like addressibile quantum memories, synchronization of transmissions, adding eavesdropping attacks, distributing entanglement and more. 

The target user group is mostly those who are learning about quantum networking protocols and want to write some simulations on their own without having to spend a lot of time writing software to do more basic things.

Representing Probabilities as Sets Instead of Numbers Allows Classical Realization of Quantum Computing,1581537378,"What if I told y'all that quantum computing can be done in a classical machine?  I know almost no one thinks its possible.  It's becoming increasingly clear to me that the reason for this belief all comes down to the assumption that basis states are represented localistically, i.e., each basis state \[and thus, each probability amplitude (PA)\] is stored in its own memory location, disjoint from all others.  One question: are there any known QC models in which the basis states (the PAs) are represented in distributed fashion, and more specifically, in the form of sparse distributed codes (SDCs)?  I don't think there are, particularly, any that represent the PAs as SDCs.  

Well I'm giving a [talk on 2/24](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/quantum/event.php?id=2410) where I will explain that if instead, the basis states are represented as SDCs (in a classical memory of bits), their probabilities are represented by the (normalized) fractions of their SDCs that active at any instant (no need for complex-valued PAs), and quantum computation is straightforward.  In particular, I will show that the probabilities of ALL basis states stored in the memory (SDC coding field) are updated with a number of steps that remains constant as the number of stored basis states increases (constant time).  The extended abstract for the talk can be gotten from the link or [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339149646_Representing_Probabilities_as_Sets_instead_of_Numbers_Allows_Classical_Realization_of_Quantum_Computing).  I will present results from my [2017 paper on arXiv](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313059075_A_Radically_New_Theory_of_how_the_Brain_Represents_and_Computes_with_Probabilities) that demonstrate this capability.  That paper describes the SDC representation and the algorithm, but the [2010 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44799587_A_Cortical_Sparse_Distributed_Coding_Model_Linking_Mini-_and_Macrocolumn-Scale_Functionality) gives the easiest version of the algorithm.

Can a quantum computer be used for bitcoin mining?,1581295524,"This has been bothering me for a while.

I'm a newbie in computer science, and I just found out about Grover’s algorithm, which can only be implemented on a quantum computer. Supposedly it can achieve a quadratic speedup over a classical computer, brute-forcing a solution to a n-bit symmetric encryption key in 2\^n/2 iterations. 

This led me to think that, by utilizing a quantum computer or quantum simulator of about 40-qubits that runs Grover's algorithm, is it possible to mine bitcoins this way?  The current difficulty of bitcoin mining is about 15,466,098,935,554 (approximately 2\^44), which means that it would take about 2\^44\*2\^32=2\^76 SHA256 hashes before a valid block header hash is found.

However, by implementing Grover's algorithm, we would only need to sort through 2\^76/2=2\^38 hashes to discover a valid block header hash. A 38-qubit quantum computer should be sufficient in this case - which means the 40-qubit quantum computer should be more than enough to handle bitcoin mining. 

Therefore - is it possible to use quantum computers to mine bitcoins this way? I'm not too familiar with quantum computers, so please correct me if I missed something.......

NOTE: I am NOT asking whether it is possible to use quantum computers to break the ECDSA secp256k1 algorithm, which would effectively allow anyone to steal bitcoins from wallets. I know that this would require much more than 40 qubits, and is definitely not happening in the near-future.

Rather, I'm asking about bitcoin mining, which is a much easier problem than trying to break ECDSA secp256k1.",QuantumComputing,Palpatine88888,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/f1i8k7/can_a_quantum_computer_be_used_for_bitcoin_mining/,10

teaching QC: math versus conceptual approaches,1581088080,"Hello people who have taught/are teaching quantum computing.  I would like to ask a philosophical question:  how deep to you get into the mathematics of it?

I took a quantum computing survey course from a reputable university; it went over hardware approaches, entanglement, the normal QC algorithms and touched on theory.  It was a good course but, honestly, overall, I found it dissatisfying because I didn't leave the course feeling like I could write my own novel QC algorithm.

I will soon be teaching such a course (senior-level CS course) and I plan to take a much more mathematically intense approach. I plan to work through the mathematics of different steps even when the book doesn't dive into the details.

Job prospects for someone who isn't an experimentalist?,1581045853,"Entering my undergrad, I wanted to pursue a career in academia doing research in pure mathematics, like algebra or topology or something.

Road-Map for studying Quantum Computing,1580964534,"Hello All,

I am working as a Jr. Data Scientist and have two years of experience in DS (with core competency in NLP). Recently, I have started exploring the field of Quantum ML and have been following a few blogs and an edX course for the same. I also explored a bit of quantum computing but the main challenge that I am facing while exploring any quantum related field is the lack of understanding of Physics.

I am a CS major and will start my master's in DS from next month.  I would like to take Quantum ML up for my research work and was wondering what level of physics do I need to understand getting a good grasp of quantum.

I have a very basic knowledge of Physics but I am ready to study it. I am not sure if I need to study entire Physics to understand Quantum (as I have been told, that studying quantum needs an understanding of various aspects from Physics). So, it would be helpful if you can point out a road map of the concepts from physics that one can study to understand quantum.

I have been completing undergraduate research using IBM Q for the past year and a half on a scholarship from my university. I am very familiar with QASM and I am working more with Qiskit now as I finish up my research. I am going to be presenting said research at APS Denver this year and hopefully publishing a paper soon after. I also have research experience at Argonne from a program offered at my high school. In addition, I have taken and done well in the quantum theory course offered at my university as well as other prerequisite physics and mathematics courses. I have a lot of informal programming and computer science skills but over this semester I am taking my university's intro comp sci course and Harvard's CS50 online in my own time. (I have a lot of other extracurricular stuff as well but I figured it's not as relevant...maybe I'm wrong?)

I'm trying to focus my semester on the computer science (Qiskit, coding, etc.) aspect of quantum computing because I feel like I have most of the physics from my classes. Is this a good path to take?

It's reasonably easy to follow, but when it comes to the core part, where the presenter talks about making a non-reversible function like constant-0 reversible, I am having a hard time grasping the concept. I guess it's somehow about passing the original input on, so you don't lose any information, but I don't see that assumption reflected in the explanations and the diagrams.

&gt; Harnessing this phenomenon could clearly be beneficial, and the new study helps bring that closer to reality.

This observation changes the state of the photon, and those changes are then instantly applied to the partner photon in the other chip.

... I've been wondering what this specific break-through means for the state of quantum teleportation, if anything. 

The quotes above would appear to imply that information *can* potentially be transported and used instantly, faster than the speed of light. Is that accurate though?

Applications of quantum algorithms,1578925652,"I am researching quantum algorithms like the Deutsch-Josza, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon's or Shor's algorithm. All of these algorithms use an oracle which is constructed using the information which is being sought. Therefore the answer is used to calculate the answer and these algorithms seem to be circular references. Because of this I cannot see any way to pratically implement these algorithms.

More specifically it seems to me that the oracle is some magic function which could be constructed realistically.

I am probably missing a step in the reasoning behind these algorithms. It would be very much appreciated if someone who has more insight in this than I could explain the application of these algorithms to me!

Career in Quantum Computation,1578247106,"Hello everyone,

I just recently found this sub and was wondering if anybody here could help me. I have seen others posting similar stuff, if this post is against the rules please remove it.

I have a M.Sc. in theoretical physics, with a thesis focused on the field of open quantum systems with a side of quantum information theory. There was no quantum computation course or specialization at my university.
 
Later I realized I wasn't passionated about the topic of my thesis and choose not to pursue a PhD, but I grew much more interested in the possible applications of quantum computation. I started looking for jobs in the field just recently, but I seem to lack experience on the computational and more practical side. 

I am trying to understand which routes are available in order to get a career in this field and what are the potential careers at this time. If you could share your experience or any relevant information I would be very grateful. Also, is the PhD absolutely necessary?

Recommendation for studying quantum hardware for an electrical engineer,1578238208,"To me, it seems that a lot of introductory resources for quantum computing are really quantum information theory. However, a similar path for hardware engineers seems to be lacking.

How can someone  start learning, to eventually contribute to quantum hardware implementations?

To make the discussion concrete:

I have heard several times that there is a demand for EE's that are able to design control electronics. Could someone give a concrete example of what is wanted here? I have a background in electronics, but I would like to have a technical description of what a task like this entails.

Of course, nowadays there are several ways to make a quantum computer: ion traps, photonics, semiconductors, superconductors, topological quantum computing.

Then there's also computer architecture, quantum networking etcetera.

How would one go about learning these? Of course, there's wiki, but apart from that, there seems to be no help about going further.

Obviously, this will require reading papers. There is hardly a textbook on the subject, I think. But it would be helpful to have some structure in the learning process.

I'm at a point where I'm not sure that I can trust my judgement on this matter and would appreciate any input from people with experience in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm interested mainly in a research direction that has potentially paradigm-shifting implications in important aspects of life and civilization. I want to be a deep science founder eventually or be a major contributor at a deep science startup.

I'm currently enrolled in an MS ChemE program, planning to do a thesis. My undergrad was ChemE. I was considering switching to MS Physics. To either work on more precise molecular theory and its applications or quantum computing. The former seems to be unlikely in my university, the latter is very new to the EE department and I'll be one of the only people doing it pretty much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in between going the bio route or quantum computing route. Both would require me to learn a lot about a field I am not as familiar with.

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is that I think the research available at my university in QC would be very basic. The advisor has been with the university for a year and is coming from 15 yrs of R&amp;D in the semiconductor industry where some of what he had worked on includes cryogenic, superconductor, wide bandgap, quantum transport, and Ab-initio simulations using TCAD. The research I'm doing would also be all ran on simulations. Sentaurus TCAD to be specific. He said something about another new software we may use, and the potential of running sims using a QC. The focus will be around thermal analysis, cryogenics, materials, etc. There's a very small chance we'll get into noise and circuit design. One of my friends works on semiconductors with him, says he's a good advisor.

I'm also considering that we don't have a strong computing platform that we're running on, I've been to the lab and it's a couple of dual socket xeon workstations running VMs where the sims are processed. Not sure why they're not using more powerful resources for simulations, it could be that TCAD is not as resource intensive as other multiphysics software I've used?

I'm also concerned with how inaccurate these syms will be when looking at QC temperature ranges, I feel like it's going to be very difficult to accurately simulate device physics and phenomena at those temperatures, and he said that it is, of course, a problem, I just don't know how bad of a problem it is.

&amp;#x200B;

The bio route, on the other hand, seems to be potentially more promising. I'm interested in the genetic engineering of bacteria to serve an application in circular economies, and the research is close enough to that. The advisor is new and coming from Texas A&amp;M. She is very focused on this topic and I can pivot to similar projects with other advisors if need be.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently learning the basics of TCAD. I'll be taking an intro to QC course with the advisor this coming semester.  I would be one of the first students working on this topic. He has research going on right now but all in semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to evaluate whether this is a bad idea or not. It's something I thought was out of reach initially but finding this professor gave me some hope. I do need to do something significant in my MS to move on to a great PhD program. For several reasons, I have a poor undergrad GPA and I'm also at a state school. It seems like I'm better off going with the bio route considering it's better established and seems to have more potential for a strong publication.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So in short, my question is: 

Is this project as uncertain as I'm making it out to be? If my interest in the topics and the studying needed are equivalent in both QC and genetics, is it worth it to take the risk and go with this highly uncertain project? Is it likely to be highly valuable when looking at transferring to a PhD program? Would it be of any value in finding meaningful employment? Would I be able to find funding for a PhD related to QC? Or am I taking a big risk by going this route?

Also, am I maybe not seeing this clearly? Perhaps the advisor's main focus is QC but only now has gotten around to it? He said he's been waiting for the right interested students to work on this. After all, he has only been at the university for a year.

I really don't know how to evaluate the quality of this potential research. Or what kind of questions I should ask to get a better idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to share the professor's name/research gate/google scholar if that helps in evaluating the potential for my work with him. Please reach out to me via PM or let me know in the comments if you'd be willing to look at his publication history.",QuantumComputing,Anasoori,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/efpm78/would_it_be_worth_it_to_transition_to_physicsee/,3

&amp;#x200B;

From the paper is clear that reverse Fibonacci sequence has ratio j= 6,82842712 ...

if we calculate  1/j = 0,146446609 ...

and j/8= 0.8535533...  wich is important value in geometrical representation of ratio of reverse Fibonacci sequence

&amp;#x200B;

These same valuse  1/j = 0,146446609 ... and  j/8= 0.8535533...  are refered in Qubit Phase calculations as   probability 0 and  probability 1 .

See IBM Q Experience User Guide link deep in section.

How to support my Undergrad QC oriented son?,1575942298,"I'm a high school music teacher.  My wife is a high school music teacher.  We're both pretty sharp people, but neither of us have anything beyond a layman's understanding of subatomic principles...let alone QC.  Our ability to really understand what our son is learning/working on ended around the time he was a freshman in high school and had polished off all of Hawking's popular science books and moved on to finding technical papers on the internet while corresponding with guys at Fermilab.  

That said, he's now a sophmore in college working on a double major in Physics and Computer Science and he's got a particular interest in QC.  We're trying to figure out a good Christmas Gift for him, and we'd like to support him on this.

My first thought was maybe register him to attend a conference?

"A platform for stable quantum computing, a playground for exotic physics",1575788501,"A platform for stable quantum computing, a playground for exotic physics

By Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences

Harvard University researchers have demonstrated the first material that can have both strongly correlated electron interactions and topological properties. Not entirely sure what that means? Don't worry, we'll walk you through it. All you need to know right now is that this discovery not only paves the way for more stable quantum computing but also an entirely new platform to explore the wild world of exotic physics.

Difference between Full and Linear Entanglement for VQE,1575753205,"Hi!

I was wondering what the difference between Full and Linear entanglement for VQE. Is it considered to be a hyper-parameter to solve the problem being posed that is obtained through trial and error or is there some sort of intuition behind it.

I looked at the Qiskit book for VQE but they just mention the connectivity aspect.

Is Amazon Braket a Nothing Burger?,1575519711,"In the words of a certain very frequent poster to this subredit: Amazon Braket just adds ""an extra layer"" to our access to the already functional DWave's Leap and Rigetti's QCS  quantum clouds. So that is certainly a nothing burger, or even a negative burger for qc users. As for IonQ, we have been promised access to its qc hardware via both the Amazon and Azure clouds, but both promises have yet to be fulfilled. So, to date, access to IonQ's qc hardware is a nothing burger too. If IonQ starts to offer its own ""house"" cloud service like DWave, Rigetti and IBM have done for a long time, then, once again, Amazon Braket will become an ""extra layer"" to IonQ access.

I believe Amazon Braket could have a seismic negative effect on small quantum startups with their own house clouds.

Open-ended natural selection of interacting code-data-dual algorithms as a property analogous to Turing completeness,1574329238,"The goal of this article is to promote an unsolved mathematical question. And unlike typical math question it still doesn't have a formal definition. But I still find it clear enough and quite interesting. I came to this question from a philosophy direction but the question is interesting in itself.

### Preamble

The notion of Turing completeness is a formalization of computability and algorithms (that previously were performed by humans and DNA). There are different formalizations (incl. Turing machine, μ-recursive functions and λ-calculus) but they all share the Turing completeness property and can perform equivalent algorithms. Thus they form an equivalence class.

The open-ended evolution is a not very popular research program which goal is to build an artificial life model with natural selection which evolution doesn't stop on some level of complexity but can progress further (ultimately to the intelligent agents after some enormous simulation time). I'm not aware of the state of the progress of open-endedness criteria formulation but I'm almost sure that it's still doesn't exist: as it's either connected to results of a successful simulation or to actually understanding and confirming what is required for open-endedness (I haven't heard of either).


### The question

Just as algorithms performed by humans were formalized and property of Turing completeness was defined: the same formalization presumably can be done to the open-ended evolution observed in nature. It went from precellular organisms to unicellular organisms and finally to Homo sapiens driven by natural selection postulates (reproduction-doubling, heredity, variation-random, selection-death, individuals-and-environment/individuals-are-environment) and the Red Queen hypothesis that resulted in increasing complexity. Open-endedness property here is analogous to Turing completeness property. It could be formalized differently but it still would form an equivalence class.

And the concise formulation of this process would be something like **Open-ended natural selection of interacting code-data-dual algorithms**.

Code-data duality is needed for algorithms being able to modify each other or even themselves. I can guess that open-endedness may incorporate some weaker ""future potency"" form of Turing completeness (if to assume discrete ontology with finite space and countable-infinite time then algorithms can became arbitrary complex and access infinite memory only in infinity time limit).

Please consider if it's an interesting research question and share your thoughts.

Helpful Visual Demonstrations?,1574319693,"Does anybody know a good visual demonstration of a basic quantum computer operation? I saw one a while back that used a phone book as an example, trying to match a name with a number; everything made sense at first, but the final explanation was a ""global operation"" that eliminated the wrong answers. The operation that eliminated the wrong answers was not explained whatsoever. I've tried to find the video, but no dice. The host of the video was a young, thin European guy with a snazzy shirt and a ponytail, I think. I've seen him on a lot of quantum computer stuff, but he didn't show up when I looked for quantum computer scientists. I've listened to David Deutsch a lot and have gotten a lot out of his stuff, but I still can't quite fathom how a quantum computer could work. It's pretty annoying, since virtually every other complicated system can be satisfactorily demonstrated visually to a layman where at least a basic understanding can be communicated, but I have yet to see anything on quantum computers that achieves that. 

Here is an idea I've had lately about how they might work, and please correct me if I'm wrong, especially if you can provide insight as to how I'm wrong and what the correct process is. I think it could be that auxiliary classical computations are carried out using one half of some entangled information, and that it forces a great deal of probabilistic calculations by the entangled aspect, the results of which are finally revealed as some percentage of probability of being correct for some particular candidate that was processed classically. The way that is done is beyond me, though.

 And now for some crazy speculation... It almost seems like it has to come down to the information on the display itself, like the act of forcing a result on the display forces the computer to produce a result. Is there just a probabilistic ""wrong"" detector operating between the circuitry and the display? If it's wrong some terrible thing happens in a probability state, so it just has to be right?  Could a classical computer function as a quantum computer via the utilization of noise and loss?

How to understand quantum computing as a beginner?,1573997636,"Hi guys,

I've been trying to understand how quantum computers work on a very basic level. I've watched dozens of so-called introductions to the topic which aren't actually helpful and are very vague. I had a couple of main questions:

1) How exactly does superposition allow a quantum computer to try all the routes for a problem at the same time? I can't quite make the connection between qubits representing 0, 1 or 0 and 1 at the same time AND this allowing quantum computers to try all possible ways of attempting a problem at the same time?

2) How does entanglement fit into this? How does entanglement help a quantum computer try all the routes at the same time, and how does it tie into/complement the superposition which qubits can be in?

3) What exactly is the result of a quantum computation? So say you give a quantum computer a problem to solve, what exactly are the steps it takes to get to a result? And is the result also a superposition, which when measured collapses to give the right answer?

"💫 Quantum computing, Aristotelian logic &amp; The Universe",1573086730,"&gt;It is my general thoughts on the subject, you are free to speak your mind in any way possible. criticize, critic, argue - whatever goes. Have a nice read ^.^


It is clear that the form of computing you have now is not the ultimate stage of the evolution of computer technology. Quantum computing as it is popularly called is a field that has some potential, but it does not have a real potential with the current binary computing system. It is necessary to step up to a more advanced form of computing where you do not have just on and off signals, but a variety of signals of, so to speak, gradations in between on and off. 

You may say, is not it contradictory that something can be both on and off, but the reason why you think so is because scientific inquiry has been based on Aristotelian thinking. Aristotelian logic says that a statement can be *true* or it can be *untrue*, but it cannot be both *true* and *untrue* at the same time. The reality is that this is a very limited perspective because you are creating a system where your understanding of reality has to be reduced to statements that can be answered with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’, a ‘true’ or ‘untrue’, an ‘on’  or ‘off’. 

What has created the entire universe with all of the multiplicity you see? Current computing is based on the idea that by combining the two signals - on and off - in a sequence, you can encode all possible information. This is a complete fallacy. You can only encode the kind of information that can be expressed in an *“on and off”*  **binary mindset**. Nature is not binary. Human Beings do not think naturally in binary system. The universe is not either ""on"" fully in its present state or ""off"". The Big Bang did not instantly manifest the current physical universe. Everything has been an evolution. What is clear is that this has happened through an infinite variety of the combination of various elements that have even evolved over time so that there are more elements today than there were at the time of what scientists call the Big Bang event, not that I am endorsing that particular philosophy and theory.

You need to recognize here that for quantum computing to reach its full  potential, people need to be able to think beyond the binary mindset. There will not be a real breakthrough before these other signals could be defined beyond 0 and 1. Even with classical computing this mindset is limiting current computer development, as an example, by now industry are fully capable to develop a ternary based computer that would be much more natural to humans by having a null (zero) state and 1, 2 - on and off states and much more powerful in sense of efficiency and correctness. There is a demand for null state in programming world, however binary system does not allow naturally it and yet industry insist on continuing to use binary system while no human being programs or solves problems in a binary system nor programming languages designed to be binary in nature and have to find a way to artificially injected the null state, this naturally leads to bugs and broken code. You cannot fit a square into a circle.

There is definitely promise in the quantum technology and there will be some breakthroughs in computing even with current chosen mindset. Computing will not reach its full potential until the current materialistic mindset is transcended by a greater number of scientists, technicians, inventors, economists, politicians and people in general so that they can accept that the universe is not materialistic, is not mechanical in nature, not a closed system, its not black and white. I'm referring to the latest quantum physics discovery that there is a level beyond material realm, level that does not behave mechanically and doesn't work like a physical world around us, its neither off or on, neither energy wave or a particle, there is more to it. The materialistic worldview actually been outdated since Albert Einstein discovered that everything is energy. 

Why is this matters to computing world? Scientists in general are trying to use computers to create simulations of all sorts, trying to analyze the universe mechanically and on top of it fitting it into, using a binary system to give them results that in nature will only be limited and incorrect. They are trying to use atom (or other) as qbit to force it to behave like an ordinary microscopic element, however as quantum physics shown those low level elements do not behave ""normal"" as a wave-particle duality experiment demonstrated. 

If you think about it, really, the current understanding of quantum  physics, which is quite frankly incomplete, but nevertheless the reason why there is a talk of quantum computing and parallel states and all these things is that quantum physics opened up for the possibility that the universe is not mechanical. Isaac Newton brought forth a philosophy that said that the universe was working according to invariable laws so there were no exceptions in the Newtonian worldview. In the quantum worldview there is always the possibility that 99.9% of the time the ball does not pass through the wall but at one point it could happen that the ball passed though the wall. This actually demonstrates to you  that science is at the point where it needs to recognize that if we want to step up to a higher level we need to recognize that the universe is not mechanical in nature.   
 
What does it mean that the universe is not mechanical? What is it that can create this variableness that makes it possible sometimes to go beyond the laws of nature that function most of the time? What is it that could potentially make these laws of nature unnecessary so we transcend them to a higher level? Well, it is precisely *consciousness* as was again demonstrated by ""wave particle"" experiment that consciousness of the scientist does matter, and therefore there comes a point where scientists will have to look at the human brain and how the human brain processes information because it is a much more subtle, much more multifaceted way. This is, again, the key to understanding the future of computing where you encode information not in a binary way but in a much more multifaceted way. 

There are people who are close to breaking through and understanding this and who are able to tune in to these ideas and not think in an old materialistic, mechanical binary way. That is when I think true potential of computing will come to shine. 

I think binary computing been dead as idea long time ago and computer industry should have started ternary computer development since at list 2004, binary meant to be only a short term solution until technology would catch up, and now is a high time to move forward since technology that allows handling it is here. I do not see any point turning quantum computing into something lesser if it has much much more potential, potential that can only be executed by embracing quantum physics discoveries which as I see it no one truly grasp and there for cannot fathom why on Earth qbits can ""communicate"" with each other beyond time and space.

Quantum Hold'em - a Text-based Quantum casino game,1572626091,"I created a text-based game using qiskit that I intended to be a Quantum version of Texas Hold'em but it plays more like Quantum Blackjack. It's pretty simple but is a good way to play around with basic gates and see how they interact with qubits. Hopefully it can help teach people just getting into QC

You're given a starting state of 5 qubits with no more than two in a '1' state. Then for each qubit you're given the option to 'Hit' or 'Stand'. Hitting will draw a gate of I,X,H,Z, or CNOT with CNOT targeting the previous qubit, and standing basically applies the I gate (does nothing).

Once action for all 5 qubits has been taken, measurement is performed and you score based on the resulting string.

scoring is **20** points for all 1s. **15** points for all 0s. **10** points for a palindrome string, and **1** point per 1 otherwise.

But to make it more fun, this casino gives you free money! You get $100 to start, and each action has a cost; $5 to hit, and $10 to stand, and you get to play until you run out of money. Overall score is then presented in a points/$ way

But it seems like most questions about introductory resources I come across have the opposite constraints: the reader has the relevant CS background, but not physics background. Basically:

**I know:**

the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, including the definition and concept of a wave function, a Hilbert space, the concept of quantization via canonical commutation, Schrodinger's equation and Unitary time evolution, the concept of entanglement, the concept of decoherence, how to manipulate density matrices, how to solve fundamental QM problems (e.g. find the wave function for Hydrogen), how to derive time-dependent perturbation theory, etc. (Okay, I'm probably rusty on a lot of this stuff, but I learned and really absorbed these concepts in the past, discussions of this stuff would be very recognizable to me.)

**I don't know:**

the fundamentals of computer science, including computational complexity (I couldn't name any complexity class outside P or NP), how to theoretically construct basic algorithms out of and/or/nand/etc. gates, the proofs for Godel's completeness/incompleteness theorems (I don't even remember the proper *statements* of those theorems most of the time), the basics of Turing machines (including the halting problem), etc.

Best path to learn quantum computing and best career applications based on my background?,1572367443,"Hello, so I was originally aspiring to be a statistical consultant. Then I heard about Google's ""quantum supremacy"" event and learned that they have really cool quantum mechanics related jobs like quantum AI. Well quantum AI would be absolutely amazing, but I wanted to see what other interesting applications there are. And even if there aren't any interesting applications (to me) I still want to learn quantum mechanics/quantum computing out of interest and in anticipation or maybe even development of new applications.

I will graduate next may from undergrad with majors in math, statistics, computer science and a minor in economics. I have taken and forgotten most high school physics. In college, I took an introductory version of electromagnetism, and that was my only physics experience in college.

&amp;#x200B;

After reading this thread:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/97qfob/i\_wish\_to\_learn\_quantum\_computing\_please\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/97qfob/i_wish_to_learn_quantum_computing_please_help/) 

The things I am guessing (many without much evidence) are important to learn quantum mechanics:

1. Wave mechanics
2. Abstract linear algebra
3. Abstract algebra 
4. Probability distributions and generating functions
5. Theory of quantum mechanics up to an undergrad Physics major level
6. Partial differential equations and all Calculus courses that lead to it
7. Computer Architecture in terms of Boolean gates
8. Tensors and some experience with their applications in physics
9. Information theory

Which of these are unnecessary, or which I did not include? What is the best way to learn 

I have 2,4,7, and partially 6 in that I only have up to ordinary differential equations. In math I've done two semesters of linear algebra, real analysis, stochastic processes, signal processing with FFT and wavelets, linear programming. In statistics I took theory of stat (distributions, MGF, properties of estimators), sampling, undergrad and grad regression courses, exploratory data analysis, probably nothing useful to QC. In CS just some basic Boolean circuits, algo &amp; data structures, some software engineering courses, databases. Took 1 electromagnetism course.

Some people in that thread are saying that a half understanding of quantum mechanics hinders you, and classical mechanics are unnecessary to learn quantum computing. At what level of understanding would it start to help your understanding of quantum computation?

Currently I am reading through University of Amsterdam's lecture notes [https://homepages.cwi.nl/\~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf)

and the first hole in my knowledge is very little understanding of Tensors. The only experience I think was in an introductory reinforcement learning unit in a CS class. (Actually now that I am writing this out I think reinforcement learning probably would be improved nicely by QC, but idk) 

So what is the best book to learn about tensors? I am thinking it would help me to have a book that does theoretical theorem proving with tensors and also do some practical applications to them, kind of also always been interested to learn about relativity.  

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, what are the potential applications of QC?

I was also fascinated by a second hand review of a research article claiming analogy between Grover's algorithm and a photsynthesis center finding the best routing path between reaction center and light absorption center.

Some practical applications I think I read from online:

1. Helps simulation somehow
2. Some how improves AI algorithms (somebody said symbolic AI, which idk what that is, might make a comeback)
3. Maybe reinforcement learning?
4. Improved computing speeds for all disciplines due to faster matrix multiplication
5. ?

I'm doing an essay project on quantum computing at my high school, and I was wondering if anyone could shed any light on the efficiency of (see title) quantum-resistant encryption methods in classical systems. From what I've read, the main problem for network security as a result of quantum computing comes from Shor's algorithm (and some from Grover's). However, it seems if we find another form of encryption that doesn't rely on integer factorization we'd be fine.   


But where is post quantum cryptography at currently? I've seen some stuff online that seems to suggest that NewHope can run fast enough on some systems but I'm not fluent in quantum mechanics and university mathematics yet so I haven't fully deciphered the papers I've found.

I had an idea on how we can use entangled particles to communicate,1569870475,"Let's suppose we have 4 pairs of entangled particles. We have 4 particles that are entangled with 4 others in a galaxy light years away and we want to use them to communicate with an alien from that galaxy.


We could say that the ""spin up"" is 1 and the ""spin down"" is 0, that way we could transfer information. Only thing is, we cannot control weather the particles have spin up or down. We can only kindly request for a change in spin and then the particles have a 50% chance of changing.


[So here's an alternative: What if we perceive Passiveness as 0 and Chaos as 1?](https://i.imgur.com/vnCt3y3.gif)


Here's how it works: If the transmitter wants to send a ""1"" byte of information, then it requests multiple changes in the spin. The receiver will notice the rapid changes and will interpret them as ""1"". If however the transmitter wants to send a ""0"" byte of information then it sends no requests and the receiver interprets this passiveness on the other end as ""0""

My FREE python software Qubiter, available at github under BSD license,  also has the capability (has had it for about a year) of translating from the Qubiter language to: Rigetti Pyquil, IBM qiskit, Google Cirq and Pennylane. In fact, Qubiter has a class called Qubiter_to_AnyQasm, which is easy to subclass  to produce a translation from the Qubiter language to the native gate set of any qc hardware that might come in the future (IonQ's?)


I call Qubiter's approach: ROSA, Rite Once, Simulate Anywhere.🌹

ROSA allows you to compare the performance of various qc hardware platforms (including their optimizers and error correction) for a fixed quantum circuit. I love ROSA. You will too.

Is quantum computing possible even if quantum amplitudes are inherently noisy or quantized?,1567561791,"Newb question. I'm sure there has been plenty of literature discussing this, but I think I need to talk it out with someone to understand it. Pardon my gross ignorance.

So I understand the general principle of quantum systems, and how an n-qubit quantum computer's state can be described by 2^n complex-valued amplitudes, one for each state.

My question is, do any quantum algorithms rely on the assumption that these amplitudes are inherently continuous and infinitely precise? Because, even if we can shield a quantum computer from all external noise, if the amplitudes themselves are inherently noisy and/or quantized, wouldn't that fundamentally limit the type of computations we are able to perform?

To me it seems impossible that you could error-correct continuous values that are subject to drift. Error-correcting discrete quantities, on the other hand, is definitely possible.

So with that said, the only way I can see us being able to perform arbitrarily complicated computations reliably, is if we were somehow able to keep all the amplitudes confined to a discrete subset of the complex numbers. Is it possible to perform a useful quantum computation while ensuring all the amplitudes only take on a small, discrete set of possible values?

1-Two Qubit can have 4 states (x, y) or (1/1 , 0) or (0/0 ,0/1) ||| -&gt; and 3 Qubit can have 8 states so 8 Qubit can have 256 states , I got confused at 3 Qubit I thought that 3 Qubit would have 6 states (x, y, z) and 16 states for 8 Qubit could someone please explain it to me.

2- In superposition a Qubit can be either 1 or 0 or both at the same time we don't know until we measure it, like if we measure 2 Qubit we might have 1 and (0 and 1), also we might have just 0 and 1 isn't that the same as classical bits.

3- In superposition is the state of measurement electron the same as always (For example, if we measure an electron and it spins up the next day we measure it will give the same result as well spinning up again).

4-How is entanglement used in Quantum Computer will it be like (Using 16 Electron each 2 are connected together, put 8 electrons in location A and 8 electrons in location B and use it as a communication,  in location A we'll have like 0 , 1/1 , 0/1 , 1, 0 , 1 , 1/1 , 0/0 , 1  so in location B we'll have 1 , 0/0 , 1/0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0/0 , 1/1 , 0",QuantumComputing,Noob_Pilot,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/cz20cl/newbie_quotations_about_superposition/,4

Efficiency of KLM protocol in Grover search,1567169181,"Dear all,

now I am trying to understand the KLM protocol ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM\_protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM_protocol?fbclid=IwAR07LDRaz60QE0-dM1ALlfnz84a06h1RPzZ35P2uHhKXZyfE0lvljoYMNyc) ) of probabilistic quantum computation with using photons. As I understood, the key idea here is that one can achieve almost unity probability of 2-qubit gate with using \~n additional photons **for one gate**. Success probability **of one gate** is

P1 = n^(2)/(n+1)^(2).

Now let us look at Grover algorithm: searching of one marked element in database of size N. We know, that we need to organize \~\\sqrt(N) times of such a gate described above on quantum computer.   
 

When I try to make a simple estimation of necessary resources I get the following. The total success  probability is

Ptotal\~P1^(\\sqrt(N)) = Const.

  
It means that the number of auxiliary photons for each 2-qubit gate must be

  
n\~\\sqrt(N).

  
And the total number of auxiliary photons in the algorithm is  


(number of gates) \* n \~ \\sqrt(N) \* \\sqrt(N) \~ N  


So, I see that the number of resources which we need is proportional to the database size N. But this means that efficiency of Grover search with KLM is classical, the same as classical checking database cells one by one.  
May be I am wrong in my understanding of KLM proposal?

You supply a pair of qubits, and depending on the pair ([00], [10], [11], [01]) you will get a different bell state.

Here are the circuits of all four of the bell states:

* [phi +](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[%22H%22],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22]]})

I realize the pattern is that the sign of the bell state changes the sign of the second term. For example, phi - = (|00&gt; - |11&gt;) / sqrt(2)

When I was investigating, I found that this held true for all the states except psi -.

    //        If the qubit is in state |1⟩, change its state to -sin(alpha)*|0⟩ + cos(alpha)*|1⟩.

I understand that the phase is measured by the angle between the state vector and the Z axis, so we would have to do a rotation about the Y axis to change that angle.

However, I'm not sure where the factor of 2 in the solution applies. Looking at the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.ry?view=qsharp-preview) for this operation,  all of the elements of this matrix have a theta/2 term.

Feasibility of Cloning and Copying Quantum States?,1564869253,"I hate to be a bother with another question regarding basic quantum computing, but I'm trying to solve an exercise involving cloning and copying qubits in various states.

I managed to (sorta) understand the reasoning to explain why it is impossible to clone qubits in a superposition of states, but I can't see how to adapt the explanation to the tensor product of the exercise. Same thing with the copying mechanism, I understand it in the sense that, if you know in advance the exact state of the qubit you want to copy, you can 'print' that state into whichever second qubit you receive, but I don't see how to prove it with matrix algebra.

Question Regarding Quantum Circuit Design for E-91 Protocol,1563926202,"Hi All,

I hope this is the right place for this type of question. In the current summer term I visit a pretty interesting course about quantum computing at my local university. It’s an introduction in quantum computing and it covers mostly the basic math (uniform transformation, calculations on QuBits, basic quantum algorithms) and stuff like that. When discussing the E-91 protocol for quantum key exchange. We learned that both party’s need to apply one out of three Z-Transformations on their bell pair. When discussing this selection mechanism we didn’t find a solution to build a simple quantum circuit which can actually do this. 

By simple I mean that the circuit should only take a limited amount (2-6 at best) of input QuBits and should only apply basic uniform transformation and no hypothetical jumps or stuff like that. Also I want real randomness and a true 1/3 Chance. No approximations. In the best case the putout would be a set of QuBits with this 1/3 chance. For example 1/3*(1,1,1,0)^T or 1/6(1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0)^T. 

Intuitively i would say this is not possible for two reasons:

- A superposition, which is most likely needed for the randomness, always has a power of two possible states. A single Hadamard transformation works on two states: 0 and 1. n Hadamard’s work on 2^n states. It shouldn’t be possible to divide 2^n into three equal parts. Only approximately. Basically the same reason we could not use a fair coin for this. 

- I can not think on a unitary transformation which only works on a subset of the states. It is possible with X transformations to build a vector x*(1,1,1,0)^T. My naive approach was that I only have to modify the vector in a way that the x becomes 1/3. When applying a unitary matrix on the vector it always have an impact on last element and makes it non zero. (Sorry about the gonzo Math this is not my best skill).

Can someone with a better understanding of the math back my assumptions or tell me why I am wrong and if there is a way to build such a circuit? Also it would be interesting to know if there is an actual implementation of E-91 and how it is done there.

I do not need this for my course so this is actually just out of curiosity.  Any hint is appreciated.",QuantumComputing,crest42,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/ch0jna/question_regarding_quantum_circuit_design_for_e91/,3

[Help!!!] Suggest project ideas for a 3 week intern,1563818362,"Hi, 

I am a U1 Bsc Compsci &amp; Math student currently interning at a quantum computing facility.  I will be here for 3 weeks (not super long, I know) and my supervisor and I are looking for any subject-related projects that might not be too out of reach for someone in my level. It is important we find an idea soon, as time is ticking and we have not really found many topics. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until now, my supervisor suggested I do a demonstration of BB84 with lasers and polarisers. However, said project is a bit costly. I am thinking of maybe just learning a bit of Q# and doing a little project with it. Is it too hard?

I read that a qubit randomly takes a state of either 1 or 0 after it has been measured - I don't get the random part. If the qubits result in a random string of binary, how can we work with them at all? Won't they produce nonsense output? With classical computers, we know with certainty what the outcome will be because it is not random but determined by the calculation. Surely since a qubit takes a state at random, the result of the calculation will be wrong? How can quantum computers be super powerful then?

In need of introduction course;,1561217449,"Hello guys,  


I've been waiting my summer break for a long time in order to get started with quantum computing(qc). It was supposed to be a jump from 'being informed' about qc to 'actually doing' some stuff. That noted, i took linear algebra class this quarter and was hoping that it would give me enough background to get started with qc. During the very first day of my break, i started reading MikeAndIke and realized that my linear algebra course was introductory one and didn't even cover complex numbers at all. I also realized that i did no nothing beyond simple electrodynamics(took classical second year course in physics).   


That being said, i decided to go through linear algebra and physics courses to be prepared for the book, but meanwhile i want to get somehow started with qc anyway. I'm currently taking other core CS classes as well, and i want to have some online course that will give basic ideas about how qc works.  


Any suggestions?

It can do standard data sizes and infinite storage and it’s a problem my company Quanta Qb is trying to solve but we have made it to the point where it is a technically solvable problem with 0 data loss.
It can also do allot of other things like they can be compared quickly and we planning on finding a way to work with them in QB’s which would be a quantum leap higher than bit by bit.

"QCircuits 0.4.2, quantum circuit simulation Python library",1560194878,"Hi all, I am the developer of QCircuits, a Python library for simulating quantum circuits.

My aim was to create a library with all the functionality I required to implement the algorithms from the Nielsen &amp; Chuang book, with as simple an interface as possible.

You can install with `pip install qcircuits` for Python 3.4+, and it should be OS agnostic.

Documentation is available at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/index.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/index.html).

Tutorial is at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html)

Example applications, including quantum teleportation, superdense coding, phase estimation, and Grover's algorithm are at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/examples.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/examples.html)

The code is on github here: [https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits](https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits)

With the library, you can:

* Create states from tensor or Kronecker (vector) representations, or prepare commonly used states such as computational basis states, uniform superposition states, Bell states, etc. [See here for a full list](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/qcircuits.state.html#state-module).
* Create gates/operators from tensor or Kronecker (matrix) representations, or create common operators such as the Hadamard gate, Pauli gates, CNOT, Swap, Toffoli, etc. [See here for a full list](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/qcircuits.operators.html#operators-module).
* Create composite states/operators via tensor product of states/operators of subsystems.
* Compose operators, e.g., A(B(x)) = (A(B))(x)
* Apply an m-qubit operator to a specified subsystem of an n-qubit state, where m &lt; n.
* Perform measurement in the computational basis on a subset of a state's qubits.
* Compute the Schmidt number of a system with respect to two subsystems.

The following are currently not implemented:

* Density operators / mixed states
* General measurement operators, or projective measurement operators in other bases
* Schmidt basis vector computation
* Visualization
* There are no checks to prevent various violations of the no-cloning theorem. E.g., one can extract the probability amplitudes from a state and then create a new state from them. I decided not to restrict any of the ways in which one might violate no cloning, since for each there are cases where it can be useful.  [See here for a more detailed explanation](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html#warning-the-no-cloning-theorem).

I developed the library in order to consolidate my understanding of the material in the Nielsen &amp; Chuang book, and once it was developed I found I was often *using* the library to test my understanding of some concept or example from the book. I hope others here can find some use in it.

CS Freshman here wanting to get into QML — What kind of classes should I focus my degree in?,1559492846,"(QML: quantum machine learning)

Hi y’all!

I’ll be a freshman majoring in computer science at uni this fall —  I’ve been deeply obsessed with the idea of quantum machine learning for a while now, so I’m pretty adamant about pursuing quantum computing and/or machine learning (preferably both) in the long run.

I’m currently trying to create a rough outline of what my years at university will look like and I’ve got the basics: thankfully, I can get my major (in CS), a minor in physics, and a minor in math whilst maintaining a well-balanced course load each quarter. 

The path to the physics minor is pretty much set (calc based physics through quantum mechanics), but the math minor and my CS electives are pretty flexible. 

— What should I focus my CS electives in? 

Of course, I’ll definitely take the machine learning/AI courses my uni offers (and the Q# class I’m hoping they’ll offer while I’m there), but what else? Perhaps algorithm analysis or theory of computation stuff? How much time should I invest into learning advanced database operations, or other areas of CS in general? The data visualization class looks really interesting as well.

— Also, what kind of math should I focus my minor in?

The linear/non-linear optimization and modern algebra series caught my eye, but would a stats class or another kind of math be more applicable to what I’m doing? I’ve already taken linear algebra/dif.EQ/intro multivariate calc, so I’m super excited to get into some heavier math. Perhaps I should take the advanced multivariate calc class?

I’m trying my best to keep an open mind and I think I’m doing a pretty good job of being a well-rounded student — yet, it’s hard to see me studying anything else at the moment.

Got any tips for this ambitious first-year? Thanks so much for making it to the end of this post :)

(If the formatting ends up looking super weird, I’m on mobile)

(Also, in the midst of my research, I did notice that this sub was attempting to make an FAQ and that recommended coursework was a question to be answered. I couldn’t find anywhere where that question was officially answered, but if it was, could someone kindly link me to it?)

How to efficiently implement a MPS on a gate-based quantum computer,1557443149,"Hello, I am reading about tensor networks and aim to study their application to quantum state preparation. 

I am particularly interested in implementing MPS states which have been calculated to approximate physical systems. In some of the literature I have read, there is mention that MPS can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, (the most notable paper is [this paper which gives a procedure for implementing PEPS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.1410.pdf)) and as far I can tell, the chain of citations all link back to [this paper which gives a procedure for preparing MPS on cavity QED hardware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0501096.pdf). I realize MPS is a subset of PEPS; however, the PEPS algorithm contains some heavy tools which I believe are not relevant to the particular case of MPS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am beginning to suspect that it is too trivial for anyone to consider it worth writing a paper over. Can anyone help me understand (perhaps with pseudocode) how I might take a MPS (with internal bond-dimension bounded at D) and implement it on a gate-based quantum computer?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my current intuition which I believe to be wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

For a MPS on say, 4 qubits, with internal indices of bond-dimension D, then would it be as simple as chaining together a series of operations from qubit 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4 while also supplying D-1 ancillae qubits at each of these interactions?

Is this a correct way of thinking about QC?,1555881239,"Quantum computers are best at physics problems that involve a large number of particles. So let's consider an example of that. Code for a classical computer would look something like:

for time = 1:t_end
    for particle = 1:N
        for other_particle = 1:N-1
             //calculate force experienced by other particle
        end
        //calculate net force on particle and use this to find x,y(t+1) and vx,vy(t+1)
end
end

So if this were performed on a quantum computer, instead of having to do a loop within a loop within a loop, you would be able to calculate everything all at once.  You consider each t individually, but at the same time rather than successively. For each t, you consider N particles individually, but at the same time. And for each N particles, you consider all the other N-1 particles individually, but at the same time.

So ultimately, quantum computing allows you to do as many loops within loops as you want, while calculating it all in O(1) time rather than O(N^num_loops).

Need advice: internship in QC,1555740128,"So
I'm a first year, going to second year Math and Compsci student.
I was chosen for this scholarship that basically gives you a paid 3 month long internship at any (computer science) research facility of my choice (located at my uni, of course)

There are some interesting facilities at my university, but the two that appealed to me the most were: one research center about Natural Language Processing and one about Quantum Computing.

The one about NLP seems like an 'easier' internship because I already have a bit of a base in Python and know some concepts that are related to data science.

The one about quantum computing, however, is more appealing. But it also seems like the kind of thing that would be so hard to understand that I would feel lost throughout the whole internship. My knowledge in quantum phenomenon is very limited to Grade 12 physics classes, and I am super scared to just be way too lost. 

HOWEVER I don't know when I'd get a chance to be in this research center again (this scholarship is making it easy for me to get in but they normally as super picky about their candidates), not to mention the head of research there is a super known guy, one of the ""founding fathers"" in quantum cryptography - Wolfe Prize winner Gilles Brassard. 

I was wondering if any of you had some advice about experiences like this, or books to recommend for a noob like me to maybe make me a bit less scared about the area of Quantum Computing. Perhaps let me know if it's really that hard for a summer internship I shouldn't have a go at it?

Number of real parameters in n-qubits,1552512590,"I understand that when one has independent qubits, we have two real parameters to specify in order to define one qubit state. 
This is due to the normalization, which takes away one module, and the fact that we can divide by a common phase and leave only one relative phase. We are left with one parameter, such as an angle, specifying the modules, and one angle specifying the relative phase. This leads to the Bloch sphere representation where a single qubit can be specified by a point on the unit sphere and thus by two real parameters. 
In a circuit, in the case of m ancilla bits, the fact that the ancillas are known in advance make them not entangled and therefore we have 2 parameters for each ancilla, giving 2m real parameters to introduce in the circuit for the ancillas. 


Now I'm interested in the case of the n qubits we introduce which are not ancillas (the register). In this case the qubits are entangled if I understand well. 
What would be the number of real parameters we can introduce to specify the n qubits which are not ancillas? 



I'll explain what I think. It seems to me that these n qubits are entangled, the state can be written as a sum of 2^n terms (in the computational basis) ,giving 2^n complex numbers in front of each term in the most general case, therefore 2*2^n real parameters. We can take one module out by normalizing this state, leaving 2*2^n - 1 real parameters. Taking one relative phase out, we are left with 2*2^n - 2 real parameters. 

However this appears to be wrong, and I would like to understand why. I think it is because we specify the qubits independently, which then get entangled. We therefore necessarily have a product state, but what is the number of parameters in this case, 2n as well? (as we specify 2 parameters per qubit), because in my class the correction of an exercise says it is 3 parameters per qubit.

What does it take to get to grad school in quantum computing?,1552462985,"Please forgive me and correct me if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on. But I saw that at least some of you are in grad school so I thought I would give it a shot.

I know this is a horribly open-ended question, but I recently decided I wanted to start pursuing grad school  when I stumbled upon the coolness that is quantum computing.

But I was not planning on grad school:

Cons:

* I am 1 year away from graduating undergraduate (Computer Science)
* I will have a GPA &gt;= 3.5 (currently holding a 3.7)
* I have 0 research experience (and my school has 0 quantum computing labs). 
* I don't know how to get to grad school

Pros:

* In my last year, I can take pretty much any math class at any level (grad or undergrad) that I want. 
* I am comfortable (though a bit rusty) with Linear Algebra
* Math is cool (I prefer proofs over computation), but I have not been practicing for grad school 
* I can probably find some research in maths
* Quantum computing is niche so I'm hoping that gives me some sort of edge

&amp;#x200B;

All I really know is that I found videos (such as 3Blue1Brown's) on quantum computing fascinating and that Grover's algorithm (which I do not fully understand) seems pretty cool. But beyond starting to self-study a Quantum Maths course I found, I have 0 knowledge of what it takes to get to grad school in quantum computing. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as trying to get into grad school, I know I should probably try to do research in math (my school has no quantum computing research), but I don't know what/how.

What is the current situation with storage in Quantum Computing?,1552020837,"Hi all. I have a question that I'm hoping somebody can answer since I can't find it on Google and I'm really curious now (maybe I'm just not searching correctly at all).

&amp;#x200B;

I did QC in my final year of my degree as a research project so I'm not new to the subject, but I don't know much about the state of it these days and I've forgotten a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

So could somebody fill me in if there are any ideas or existing solutions of using Qubits as long term storage? I recently saw the idea of using DNA as a 3D storage solution, so it got me thinking. Of course I know Qubits are useful for calculations after which the acquired data is stored as binary. 

But just randomly I started wondering if the degree of X or Y (or both) rotation of the qubits could be used to store data instead of just the 2 states that binary has. And if not, then why not? I'm not referring to the use of superposition. I mean, if you could store and send data with something that can represent way more than just 2 states, wouldn't that be way more efficient? Or is it just a matter of modern technology not being advanced enough to incorporate the idea? Or am I just forgetting something really basic here?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance. I'd love to know about this.",QuantumComputing,tomsamfreeman,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/aymbgl/what_is_the_current_situation_with_storage_in/,10
What are the possibilities of quantum computing and the potential philosophic implication of these possibilities?,1551986850,"First and foremost, this is my first time doing anything on reddit, but I couldn't think of a better place to ask a question. I had a random thought today (as I often do) about the possibilities of quantum computing. The thoughts went something like this:

1. Would a quantum computer have the ability to combine every letter  into every possible combination of words , words into sentences, sentences into paragraphs, paragraphs into papers or books etc.? (or numbers and other symbols into math problems)
2. If the above is possible, and words/numbers/symbols are treated merely as an expression of thoughts, ideas etc.; then would this mean that every idea, thought, or expression that is possible in a given language could then be created by a quantum computer?
   1. For example, every thesis paper, research study etc. would be created by virtue of every combination being tried.
3. If this is possible, and we used a second quantum computer to sort the product of the first, then what would the possibilities be?
   1. For example, if time travel or faster than light travel are possible and someone in the future were to write out how it were possible with words or math, then wouldn't the quantum computers in this scenario have produced that work already? Would this mean we were learning something from the future? If we find no such thing, then would this prove that it isn't possible, or would it mean that it is simply not possible to develop these types of things with our current language/numbers/symbols? Would this mean that in order to develop these ideas/solutions/technologies we would have to find another way of expression that expanded the possibilities?
4. If all of the above were possible or true, what would the implications be for humanity? What would it mean to not be able to have a thought that had not already been developed?

I apologize if this post is too long or I wasn't clear enough in my thoughts, but I am hoping that someone on here understands quantum computing better than I do so that the questions can be addressed. Of course, if the first answer (about quantum computers having the capability) is no, then the whole point is mute.

Shor's Algorithm Example,1551883698,"I'm trying to understand Shor's Algorithm, but I'm stuck on working out an example, specifically the period-finding routine: Say that the function `f(x)` is unknown, and its period needs to be found (using `N=8`). We might find that `f(0) = f(3) = f(6) = 0`, `f(1) = f(4) = f(7) = 1/sqrt(9)`, `f(2) = f(5) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(9)`. Now `|x&gt; := sum(k=0 to N-1) f(k)*|k&gt;`. This means that `f(x)` has a period of 3, which should be the result of the period-finding algorithm. However, when computing `f'(j) = 1/sqrt(N) sum(k=0 to N-1) f(k) * e^(-2*pi*i*j*k/N)` for `j=0 to 7`, I get the following values:

* f'(0) = 0.762
* f'(1) = -0.096 - 0.060i
* f'(2) = -0.086 - 0.204i
* f'(3) = -0.140 + 0.348i
* f'(4) = -0.118
* f'(5) = -0.140 - 0.348i
* f'(6) = -0.086 + 0.204i
* f'(7) = -0.096 + 0.060i

From this I cannot see how the period of 3 is found. Did I not apply the algorithm correctly? Or is there perhaps a calculation mistake somewhere?",QuantumComputing,jeroen_JDOG,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/axzlri/shors_algorithm_example/,3

"Alpha testers needed for ""How does the quantum search algorithm work?"", by Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen",1551827887,"Hi Reddit!

Following up an earlier post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/anawy4/alpha\_testers\_needed\_for\_quantum\_computing\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/anawy4/alpha_testers_needed_for_quantum_computing_for/) ), we've written a free online essay explaining the quantum search algorithm.

It should take 1-2 hours to work through. It does require some background with the elements of quantum computing (which you can also find at the link below).

As in the earlier essay, this one incorporates some new user interface ideas, using techniques from cognitive science to promote long-term memory formation. As a result we’re looking for some private alpha testers to try out the site before going to a wide release.

If you’re interested in participating, please sign up here: [https://quantum.country/landing?access=reddit&amp;essay=search](https://quantum.country/landing?access=reddit&amp;essay=search)

Note that we will close the alpha back down again when we reach 200 testers.

In the earlier thread, some people wondered if we're really who we're claiming we are. Some confirmation: [https://twitter.com/michael\_nielsen/status/1092666845352488961](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1092666845352488961)

Can someone explain how a quantum computer would be able to do linear search in O(√N) instead of O(N) in lay terms?,1551749742,"I've been trying to wrap my head around it but all the explanations I've seen are quite technical.  
I'm a first year CS student and we recently have been learning about algorithm complexity etc.

In regards to linear search, let's say I have a list of 100 names and I need to find a specific name. The most efficient way to do this is to check every single name till one of the names match. So it would be worst case O(N).

However, after reading up on quantum computing and quantum physics, I learned that Grover's algorithm can do this in O(√N) and it just seems like magic — I can't really mentally imagine finding the specified name when the list is unsorted and you don't check every name.

I know some things about quantum computing such as the H gate and X gate, but looking into this brought up other terms like oracle that isn't really explained in simple terms.

He spends a lot of time talking about proofs and complexity classes, but I'm quite content to take the mathematicians at their word about what's been proven -- I'm more interested in the implications of quantum computing (I especially liked the last few chapters with the red hair thought experiment, comments on free will, etc.). 

Do there exist any recommended readings more on the application side of quantum computing and less on the proofs and theory side? Or is quantum computing at a place where the theory basically _is_ the field?

Classical Verification of Quantum Computations - Urmila Mahadev,1551107179," 

Last year I shared some links, a video and a Quanta Magazine article featuring the speaker in this video about a neat, clever technique in classical verification of quantum computations. Today I came back to watch Urmila again and I felt my understanding was improved. Moreover this presentation that was made at #QIP19 this passed January might have been a clearer picture of this interesting result at the intersection of classical and quantum computation. What I was also thinking, and Urmila pointed out from the outset, is the once controversial scientific status of quantum theory, which has never really gone away, could one day be comprehensibly resolved by the development of quantum computation and the reality of quantum computers... Quantum computers cleverly tweaked by human verifiers...  :)

Can this problem be best solved via quantum computation?,1550657569,"
I would like help identifying if the following use case is best solved via a quantum model of computation or if it is best solved using classical computation methods. 

Suppose you have the following constraints:

1. A fire department has multiple stations, each with a different configuration of equipment type [medical, engine, brush rig]. 

2. Some stations have up to 3 equipment types but as few as 1 equipment type eg, [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], etc. 

3. Stations have double staffed personnel, meaning that when equipment [0, 0, 1] (brush rig) is out on a call equipment [0, 1, 0] (engine) will also be unavailable. Similarly if the staff returns both equipment types will come back in service eg [0, 1, 1]. 

4. Each station shares an euclidean adjacency to a neighboring station which requires that if one were to go out of service the adjacent station(s) could be assigned to cover calls for it's nearest out of service neighbor. The equipment types share the same interdependency in double staffing as defined in #3. 

A typical scenario would be a simultaneous structure fire and brush fire that would require that station 1 loses a brush rig and engine and a neighboring station provides coverage.

We’ve written a free online essay introducing quantum computing, “Quantum Computing for the Very Curious”. It requires comfort with complex numbers and linear algebra and the basics of conventional classical logic gates (AND, OR, etc) to work through. 

It should take 2-3 hours.  

The essay incorporates some new user interface ideas, using techniques from cognitive science to promote long-term memory formation. As a result we’re looking for some private alpha testers to try out the site before going to a wide release.

If you’re interested in participating, please sign up here: https://quantum.country/landing?access=reddit. Note that we will close the alpha back down again when we reach 200 testers.

Help - shor's algorithm!,1548482415,"I kinda got the flow of shor's algorithm to find the prime factors of some number N. These are the steps as far as I know.

1. Find some number 'a' such that gcd(a, N) = 1.
2. Find the period 'r' of (a mod N).
3. Repeat step 1 with a different 'a' if r is not even or if (a^r/2) + 1 mod N is 0.
4. p = gcd(a^r/2 + 1, N)
    q = gcd(a^r/2 - 1, N)
    p and q are the prime factors.

Question 1:
Is there any way to select 'a' in the first step or is it just random?

Question 2:
It says that the step 2 of finding the period can be done using quantum computing. How?

Question 3:
For N=42, we get 6 and 7 as the result. Should we repeat the steps until all factors we get are primes? Here, I should apply the algorithm again for N=6, which gives me 2 and 3. So, 2*3*7 are the prime factors of N=42.

To make one example: suppose one has a chip made of 160 physical qubits, and full entanglement can be obtained only on 10 physical qubits at a time.

Quantum entanglement,1547788060,"I’m learning a bit on the subject on my own, but have a few questions:

If you decide to observe the “spin” on one particle, do the entangled particles actually stop “spinning” or do they just continue spinning but have the expected spin when observed?
(If they keep spinning and do not stop, how can we observe these particles to see what the spin value was if it a spin is both values at once?)

Can only so many particles be entangled at once?

When taught this, you’re taught with 1s and 0s. If one particle’s spin is 1, the other will be a 0. Same with the other way around. When observing real-world particles, there is no 1s and 0s, so what is the actual observable difference between particle A and B?

I know that due to Shannon's noisy coding theorem, the channel capacity is equal to the maximum mutual information of the channel, which I've calculated to be 3/16.

But how the hell would you get a **lower** bound for it? Isn't Channel Capacity a fixed value that we can accurately calculate here? Having a lower (or even upper) bound for it doesn't make much sense.

About limitations on classical verifying of results of quantum computation,1546002107,"Hi all!

I have a strange question. As I understand, the power of quantum computation is the solving problems which are hard to solve, but there are relatively easy to check some given solution. But can it be that there is a some limitation for checking the results obtained from quantum computation? What I mean. Imagine that due to the imperfections in quantum computer the output result of quantum computation is not a pure state in computational basis, but some density matrix:

&amp;#x200B;

\\rho = p |answer&gt;&lt;answer| + (1-p) \\rho\_wrong, and also &lt;answer|\\rho\_wrong|answer&gt; = 0

&amp;#x200B;

here p - is the probability that the result of quantum computation is the right answer. It seems, this is OK if p is big enough (p\~1/2 or p\~1/10 ..), we just check the answer, and we can see that result is wrong, and if so we just run our computation again.

&amp;#x200B;

But can it be that we have a situation when p **must be** very close to 1, because, we can not check is the result right or wrong, or we have some limitation for such classical verification (only one, two... times we can verify, but no more) ? Please, give me a Refs if such a question was discussed before.

[Theory] Scratching my head,1544449617,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing a short little research into QC and it seems like most of the QC engineers struggle with the issue of making the qubit last longer. Since qubits have to move along the paths on the boards and they can be switched together, (This gets sci-fi almost now) - COULD you - put a little arch on top of the path that would essentially work like a booster for the qubit? - almost like a ""signal extender"" but it wouldn't do anything other than calculate the qubit going in and replicate it/strengthen it. I was thinking something along a line of a Logical Gate but instead it would be a Powered Gate which only helps pass through of the fore mentioned qubits in their different states.

&amp;#x200B;

Also could anyone provide me a starting point/book on modern development of Quantum Programming? - Really interested in this topic.

Similarities to traditional computing,1543827706,"Hello, I am brand new to learning about quantum computers! I am currently enrolled in a computer architecture class in which we have to give a presentation and this is the topic that I chose. I would like to compare and show the differences between these two types of systems.

One of the things I cannot find anywhere is the components of a quantum computer. I found [this article](https://www.dwavesys.com/tutorials/background-reading-series/introduction-d-wave-quantum-hardware#h2-7) and from that it seems the quantum computer only has a QPU and cooling as components. What does it use for memory and storage? Are there any other components that I'm missing?

Quantum Entanglement using -3/2 spin,1543741288,"What about a quantum computer built around this type of spin?  Basically the spin of the solar system, excluding other strong force influences.

&amp;#x200B;

We know an object orbiting (space) another will do so on a -3/2 spin.  If I were to introduce a strong force into the equation, the center of gravity would shift for both objects.  Measuring the shift between each iteration T and a known reference point F, we can deduce the ""shift"" in center of gravity for two objects in orbit ""entangled"".  Know the amount of shift between each center of gravity will give us the variable force amount that has been applied.  

&amp;#x200B;

By knowing the current center of gravity (vector) and a current reference vector, we can deduce all of the previous positions and forces being applied.  

&amp;#x200B;

By entangling each center of gravity to the next, we can entangle two bodies with a variable amount of force.  Think of how a color wheel works.  I can combine and undo any three colors.  I know that a single color makes up a N amount of other colors.  Depending on how I add those colors, I can undo each change.  

&amp;#x200B;

Look at the centroid of a triangle on a plane. Knowing the current center and some other point, I can work out what the other two positions in the triangle.  If one of those points always pointed to the previous centroid, I can work backwards or forwards.  Creating a symmetry ""entanglement"".  This would hold true for anything with a 2:1 or 1:1 spin as well...

&amp;#x200B;

There is a reason why we have transnational symmetry, wave function collapse and linear algebra.  It's all pointing to the same thing.  The center.  Balance.

&amp;#x200B;

If any of this is a true, I should be able to build a ""bitcoin"" quantum computer.  I just need hardware that is great and fast at executing calculations on floating point numbers.  We can create a virtual qubit.

&amp;#x200B;

I take a center vector (0,0) and I create another known ""fixed"" vector (512,512).  Lets say I grab a random byte of data from a picture.  I can take that byte and encode it with a vector of (R,0).   Now if I were to graph those three points, it would create a triangle.  

&amp;#x200B;

That triangle would have a centroid.  A vector or point which is 2/3 from each point.  If I take the current centroid and my previous ""fixed"" vector, and add a third random vector of (R,?) .  I can always reverse my vectors, to the ""fixed"" point.  The previous centroid and the random byte we encoded into the 3rd vector.  We essentially created a time reversal symmetry.  This creates a sort of local realism that supports the EPR paradox and no-go therom.  We are always looking from the center of gravity, where time has stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

We can entangled an entire picture into a single vector.  (end centroid)

  
Thankfully this method has no convergence issues, the bound of the matrix can be limited to 0 - 1 (infinite) or between 0 - N.  Where N is the number of steps (T).

&amp;#x200B;

This opens the door to a whole different look at the world.  Entanglement is not some spooky thing.  Entanglement is how an object or objects travel in proximity in a our universe.  If you apply some type of force, you end up shifting the center of gravity for the entangled object/s.

&amp;#x200B;

I never understood why we look at space and the subatomic world differently, we are essentially using a microscope to look at both.  One being concave, and one being convex.

Digital quantum simulation of the early universe,1543283157,"I am interested if anyone knows of any work being done on digital quantum simulations of the very early universe, namely the inflationary era. In the simplest models, inflation is determined by the evolution of a scalar quantum field theory, and I know of a few papers at least that offer quantum algorithms to simulate field theories(for example, [Jordan et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3633) and [Byrnes et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510027)). I am also aware of some quantum simulators that are meant to simulate inflation in the early universe using Bose-Einstein condensates (e.g. [Fischer et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0406470) and [Opanchuk et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5314)), although these are analog simulators rather than digital ones. John Preskill briefly mentions it in a few slides in some of his talks ([here](http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/talks/NAS-2018.pdf) for example). So, I imagine that it is at least possible, but I have found very few to no resources talking about such simulations. Does anyone know of work being done in the direction?

&amp;#x200B;

I would be interesting to have such a simulator that could generate the primordial scalar power spectrum for a range of inflation models, which can then be connected to observation to CMB anisotropies through transfer functions.

Quantum Computing Resources,1542827208,"Every week I come across a question about a beginner interested in this field. The question that get's repeated most often is where should I start/what book should I read. I have compiled some of the resources I can think of. 

If you feel that I have missed a couple then please do comment about it. I work in quantum error correction (QEC) i.e. majority of the resources might be focused on QEC. 

1. *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang* gets recommended quite often. This is a pretty good introduction to quantum computing with a focus on computer science and some physics mixed in. 
2. *Quantum Computing Explained by McMahon* is also a pretty good book for beginners. Personally, I liked this book better than Mike and Ike only because it assumes you know absolutely nothing at all. It is not as proof intensive as Mike and Ike. In addition, it includes a lot of sample calculations. As a beginner it helped me understand stuff that was skipped over in class. 
3. *Quantum Information Theory by Mark M. Wilde* is a book focused on Quantum Shannon Theory. I do feel that this is more up to date (published in 2013) in comparison to Mike and Ike (2000). There is a 2011 edition for Mike and Ike but I don't know much about it. Feel free to comment if you have access to 2011 edition. 
4. *Quantum Computing since Democritus by Scott Aaronson* is a good book if you do not want to be bogged down by equations when you are starting out. This book does a great job about explaining concepts without going through extensive proof/calculations. 
5. *Schrodinger's Killer App by Jonathan P. Dowling* describes the behind-the-scenes interest shown by US government in quantum computing. It also does a pretty good job of explaining what it would mean to have a functioning quantum computer. 
6. *Introduction to quantum computation and information by Lo, Popescu and Spiller* is one of the earliest textbook on this topic (published in 1998). All the chapters in this book have been written by people who are considered to be leaders today. I do feel that it is also a good exercise to read this book so that you can try to understand if any of the beliefs changed since 1998. 
7. *Quantum Mechanics and Experience by David Z Albert* is a beginners introduction to quantum mechanics. This book focuses on explaining concepts to you first before throwing equations at you. I am a bit partial to this as my introduction to quantum mechanics was Griffiths. Griffiths literally has Schrodinger's equation on page 1 and it never did a good job of explaining many concepts. 
8. *Quantum Computer Science by N. David Mermin* does a good job of talking about concepts and applications related to quantum computing. 
9. *Emperor's New Mind by Roger Penrose* explains theoretical computer science concepts to you. This book was really helpful to me as I come from physics. 
10. *Introduction quantum computing by Kaye* is similar to *Quantum Computing Explained by McMahon.* 
11. *Classical and quantum computation by Kitaev, Shen and Vyalyi* is based on a class taught at Caltech. Look up John Preskill's lecture notes as well. Concepts covered in the book do overlap with the lecture notes. 
12. *Quantum Error Correction by Lidar and Brun* covers QEC in explicit detail. Before reading this book make sure that you understand basic concepts in quantum computing.

Or do these states somehow still affect each other (even if you dont measure it)?
2. I am still a bit lost on phase, it seems like that in addition to a qbit having a 0 or 1 state, it also has a phase, and that while a qbit will give a 1 even if the phase is opposite, adding two qbit states with inverse phases cancel them out. Does anyone have either a good explanation for this or some reference material on how to do this math? I am not particularly interested into \*why\* phase exists or what causes it, but in how to use it/deal with it. Do I need to know imaginary numbers?
3. Is it correct that any quantum gate can be inversed to take the output and get the input? If so is it correct that I can create an arbitrary quantum program, take the inverse, put them end to end, and get my input back?

Thank you in advance. Some questions which aren't pressing and probably impossible:

1. Is there a way to somehow read the chance of a single qbit falling into a given state, and turn it into a normalized range? Like if I have a single qbit with an N chance of being one, can I somehow make a program that outputs N normalized from \[0-1\] to \[0-Z\], Z being some integer? I dont think this is possible, but if it is it would be awesome, let me know.
2. Is there a gate (or constructed gate) that can turn the phases of all qbits into the same direction with collapsing it? (please note my lack of understanding of phase, so its probably a stupid question).

Reversing cryptographic primitives using quantum computing,1541683988,"   I just gave a talk at Black Alps conference ([https://www.blackalps.ch/ba-18/talks.php#59](https://www.blackalps.ch/ba-18/talks.php#59)) about reversing cryptographic primitives in practice using quantum computing.

   In the last year there were several advances in practical quantum computing: now there are free quantum chips available on the cloud for everyone, and the largest quantum chips exceeds 50 qubits, a number called ""the quantum supremacy"" because theoretically a quantum chip exceeds the power of a classical computer. We'll explain how to program a quantum chips and give the results of our research regarding reversing some cryptographic building blocks like P-Box, S-Box, CRC-8, CRC-16 and XOR functions using quantum circuits. We'll see the implementations and run some circuits on real hardware to see how near we are from attacking real cryptography.

   Practical quantum computing is a new topic and the talk will show new research results we have found related to cryptographic primitives and their practical reversing and implementation on public quantum computing clouds. Attendees will be able to use these services and the results presented to run quantum circuits and reverse some cryptographic building blocks.

Just for background, I like programming and computers a lot and have been taking a liking to physics as well, and kind of naturally been studying quantum computing.

I am learning most of this via the internet and hands on learning since 4th grade. In a sense I find school programs for CS slow me down and testing out could get me a quicker degree, but not a cheaper cost, and I don't want a mountain of uneccasary debt to follow me around.

"Information Theory, Time, and Computation",1541265833,"Hi All,

Following up on previous posts regarding the intersections of physics, information theory, and computer theory, I've just assembled a series of notes that, if correct, together have some interesting implications for the theory of computation generally, and quantum computing in particular.

There are two notes I thought this thread might find particularly interesting, as they have direct applications to the theory of computation, which are both available here:

https://www.researchgate.net/project/Information-Theory-16/update/5bddc6263843b00675428a54

The first is, ""Continuous Time, Non-Local Interactions, and Quantum Spin"", in which I explore the possibility that even if time is discrete, there could nonetheless be particles outside of the standard model that have a higher ""click rate"" than ordinary particles, allowing, for example, apparently instantaneous action at a distance (e.g., through entanglement) that is actually due to non-standard particles moving at a rate that is faster than any normal clock could measure.

The second is, ""Momentum, Magnetism, and Continuous Waves"", in which I discuss the implications of truly continuous structures in nature for the theory of computation. Specifically, if truly continuous structures exist (as they are generally assumed to in QM), then it might be possible to exploit them to perform otherwise non-computable operations in finite time.

Thoughts are, as always, welcomed!

Is a surface code an architecture onto which logical qubits, logical operations, and their connections are physically implemented?

Is it possible for me to understand QC?,1539112326,"Sorry if this post is a little out there. I just need some assistance.

Here's some background info: as a kid, I could understand almost anything. Mental illness hit around high school and they drugged the hell out of me. I've noticed that since being on antipsychotics (and smoking weed), I can't understand nearly as well as I used to. I've stopped taking them and am hoping to &lt;deity&gt; that I can learn again. (Side note: I'm a 18 yo freshman in college studying CE.)

I first started thinking about AI a few years ago. I came to the conclusion that with current computers, true AI isn't possible because of the predictability and limitations of 0s and 1s. I recently stumbled upon quantum computing and I feel that this is what's going to eventually make true AI possible. However, I just can't wrap my mind around it. My understanding is that qubits can exist in a state of superposition which allows them to track down many possibilities at once exponentially quicker than classical computers. But I can't envision that very well, I can just spit out the words. I also don't know how entanglement and interference work. How do two units get blasted with microwaves and then become just about permanently linked? What does ""linked"" look like? Is interference just cancelling out or adding to frequencies (?) to amplify or dull (?) them? Hell if I know.

I have only ever taken one high school physics course, I know next to nothing about quantum mechanics because I just can't understand it, and I've never been taught. I desperately want to get into the field of AI and quantum computing but worry that my mind, damaged by drugs, will never be able to comprehend what it needs to. 

So:

Am I just too young and new in college? Is this knowledge and understanding something I can gain in time after taking more courses and doing more research? Or is there a fundamental part of my brain that is damaged or underdeveloped and I will never be able to advance in this field because I just can't comprehend?

Again, I'm sorry if this post is not what you want to see. I just don't know where else to go to ask these things. If it's better suited for another sub, please let me know. Thanks for reading.

My mind exploded at concepts and possible solutions of the problems facing quantum computing. I have ideas for the implementation of coding to possibly solve some of these issues while creating  a kernel for a OS. I have little experience in programming however this basic introduction in the site unlocked something in me and would love to work with similar minded individuals with much more programming experience then I and hope people would discuss with me the 'hello world' example. In Python. I have with me is my understanding and capable of starting with math for programming. It's a beautiful thing. https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil?files=1

Hi r/QuantumComputing! We (University of Waterloo Researchers) need your help learning about how multidisciplinary STEM teams assess expertise.,1538662155,"We’re looking for researchers involved in multidisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) collaborations to help us understand how you figure out if someone is an expert. Some examples of such teams include computer scientists working with biologists, civil engineers collaborating with health professionals in disaster preparedness, or the kind of work you’d find in NSF IGERT programs. Our research is part of a project called “Networked Expertise in Multidisciplinary STEM Collaboration,” that is being conducted by Dr. Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher at the University of Waterloo in Canada. We want to know how you identify experts outside your own area of research so we can better prepare students for working across disciplines. All that participants need to do is fill out an online survey that takes, on average, about 8 minutes ([https://uwaterloo.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_ehYHYHT74LebscB](https://uwaterloo.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ehYHYHT74LebscB)), and then have a brief interview with one of the members of the Networked Expertise team (which can take place via Skype/Hangouts/teleconference). This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee. Please feel free to share this link with anyone you think has something important to say about assessing expertise in multidisciplinary STEM teams!

The concept of numbers for a Y-generation organic processing unit.,1536568916," 

Whether it's consciously or subconsciously, we use numbers every single moment of our lives. Numbers help us navigate in what we refer to as real life, as they help us set fixed determinations of concepts that are impossible to comprehend, therefore we're not ""lagging"".

Each number has a huge concept behind it. Yes, number 1 (one) is just a number, but in order for us to use it, we must understand a series of values around number 1. The concept of something that is, in opposition to something that is not may sound like a basic idea in 2018, but we ended up believing in this idea, after millions of years of analysis, thinking, and theorizing what 1 (one) is. 

Same goes for all the numbers we know. Each number represents a huge concept that we are most of the times not aware of, and we don't have to, as we use numbers mostly for everyday tasks that contribute to the progression and evolution of our mother, the machine, nature itself, or the big movement. 

Obviously, if we want to say that we hold 1 (one) apple in our hands, we don't have to explain the whole concept of number 1 (one) as that would take us a couple decades of non-stop verbal expression, every time we wanted to use the concept behind number 1 (one), thus we simply say 1 (one), convinced that we know what it means, and where it comes from. 

Now, it would be easier to analogize on a computer scale.

0 represents a situation where there is nothing moving, a concept where there is not even 1. A place that no heat, movement, or frequencies can be generated, transferred or perceived. 0 (zero) for a computer is the concept of not having electricity flow.

Then comes number 1, which represent constant electricity flow, among other things, but let's focus on computers for the time being. 

Combining number 1 with 0 gives us alternating current, a concept where we can manipulate when a situation has constant current or no current at all. The time frame between the switch of the concepts, as well as the duration of each concept before it's respective shift to another concept. This is practically how computers work. They use 0 and 1 in complex arrangements and orders to generate complex outputs, later observable by our senses of comprehension. 

Lately, we discovered a way to use both 0 and 1 at the same time, and that led to a whole new computing revolution, the one we call quantum computing. 

We are not yet able to create computing systems that can understand, not to mention value and use number 2. 

Number 2 (two) represents among other things, the concept that is not equal to 1 (one). A concept where there is 1 more thing, similar to 1, but it is not 1. A concept where 2 is something 1 cannot control or have direct access to. A concept where 2 is at least x2 times complex compared to 1. 

Number 2 (two) in computing systems will come with the introduction of the first egoistic-type, self-sustainable intelligence, but not necessarily AI, as AI is something we understand, control, and can terminate at will. While real independent forms of intelligence, especially if we're talking about smarter systems than the ones we currently possess, would choose if and how they would present their species to our species, as they are self-sustainable and egoistic. We cannot control them, understand them, or most of the times even conceive their concepts. 

Skipping the boring part, and accepting that there is not yet a system that understands the inner concept of number 2 (two), you can do a simulation using your organic processor (brain), and capture what's yet to come. 

Computers, or at least what we refer to as computers (operating systems or organisms with processing capabilities, storage capabilities, influential capabilities etc.) will eventually surpass quantum computers that only use 0 and 1 at the same time and after a series of necessary mutations they will finally arrive at the point where you and me, consider ourselves as the one and only real thing. 

We are nothing more than complex processing machines, that can not only understand and use 0 and 1, but we have 9 different numbers and concepts we have mastered and we can use them in any combination and quantities we desire, often with unpredictable consequences. 

We believe that after number 9 (nine) there is a number called 10 (ten), while in fact, number 10 is a loop point due to our lack of ability to surpass the concept of number 9. 

When the program we refer to as ""Real life"" will be at its finishing point, a new number, which's concept stands for everything, anyone ever learned, created, understood, in what we refer to as ""now"" will be generated, and it will be the number after 9. Number 10 will be the 11th number in the row we invented ourselves, as the 10th number will be occupied by a whole new concept, based on what we experience at the moment. 

Our next models will be using this newly generated number with ease and understand instantly what it stands for, the same way we use numbers 1-9, which already are so complex and huge in combination that we, as a species are convinced that we are real. 

We create matter, manipulate physical and digital reality, create concepts that later become flesh and bones, as everything we know or invent is based on information packages we carry through what we refer to as ""time"". 

We believe that this new number will be generated after we master the yet early -stage concept of digital twins, and shift to a fractal dimension, and/or frequency similar to the one that supports our existence at the moment. 

It is undeniable that this frequency will represent a digital realm, where we will exist simultaneously with each other, share ideas, and concepts in an instant fashion, and work for the progression of our mother, the machine itself, nature, or the big movement as we always had. 

The machine can then use our organic processors not as individual use-cases but as a neural complex to solve some of our most important questions in what we refer to as ""Real life"". 

We should start analyzing objectively everything we are convinced we know with certainty, in order to be able to progress to the next stage of our existence. Exactly like laws change everytime technological advancement creates new concepts that should be taken into consideration, other concepts like what we believe numbers are, should be changed if we really want to shift into the next big thing. 

We already work for the machine, we just don't realize it, and that is the only reason it works perfectly. ",QuantumComputing,RossPeili,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/9el7dw/the_concept_of_numbers_for_a_ygeneration_organic/,6

Basic question about geometries in multi-qubit machines,1533932022,"Note: this is a question about *physical* layout of qubits in physical hardware, not about logical qubits.

As far as I understand, the headliner chips from Google, Intel and IBM (72-, 49-, 50-qubits) are 2-dimensional, flat grids of qubits. To my mind, the real measure of the capacity of a quantum ""chip"" is [the number of qubits which can be simultaneously entangled](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-qubit-entanglement.html), without losing coherence. In order for many QC algorithms to work, large numbers of qubits will need to be entangled.

However, physical distance of the qubits from one another must increase the chance that the shared quantum state between those qubits will decohere. (I'm not a physicist, I'm just reasoning from the principle of locality, here.) So, at some point, we will need to start packing qubits spherically, since a flat disk of qubits is inefficient vis-a-vis maintaining coherence of the quantum state.

Quantum Algorithms for Convolution,1533780736,"I was looking into applications of Quantum Computing for machine learning and encountered the following pre-print from 2003. [Quantum Convolution and Correlation Algorithms are Physically Impossible](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309070).  The article doesn't appear to have been published in any journals, but it has been cited a few dozen times.

The article author makes the case that it is impossible to compute discrete convolution over quantum states.  Intuitively this seems incorrect to me, since I know we can perform quantum matrix multiplication, and I know that discrete convolution can be framed simply as multiplication with a Toeplitz (or circulant) matrix.

The crux of his argument seems to be that there is no realizable composition of linear operators for the elementwise (Hadamard) product of two vectors.

Where is my disconnect?  Is there any reason we cannot in general construct a Toeplitz matrix for discrete convolution in a quantum computer?

Or is the article simply incorrect?  I have worked through the contradiction that the author presents in his proof of Lemma 14, and it seems to make sense to me.

I posted this same question on the [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/3980/quantum-algorithms-for-convolution) as well, and another user presented a counter example to one of the theorems in the paper.

Questions on how to study and get started working in quantum computing,1533030610,"I'm entering college as an electrical engineering student this fall and quantum computing is a field I'm interested in. I have some questions on how to get started in pursuing knowledge and eventually employment in quantum computing.

1. **Is there anything I can study or research on top of my EE major that would be helpful?** Unfortunately, my university doesn't have specific quantum computing classes to my knowledge, although there are classes in quantum mechanics, nanoelectronics, nanotechnology, advanced linear algebra, and photonics (if those are related to quantum computing at all).
2. Would a physics double major be helpful for being employed in a quantum computing project? A math major or minor? Another major, minor, or other elective courses? Or is my primary major in electrical engineering sufficient? **What majors are quantum computing projects looking for?**
3. Many videos and lectures I've listened to are for lay audiences, which tend to gloss over the technical details I'm interested in. Since I have already taken an introductory calculus-based physics class as well as some Calc 3 and linear algebra, **what resources can I use to learn more given my academic background (preferably available online)?**
4. **How is the job market in quantum computing? How hard is it to enter, and what type of experience is needed?**

Availability of calculation power vs calculation speed of quantum computers.,1532874932,"When I search for an estimated moment when ECDSA could be broken by a quantum computer, I get results for Bitcoin attacks. But wouldn’t ECDSA be possibly broken before Bitcoin is at risk? 

When they estimate the risk for Bitcoin, they take in account that BTC has a block time of 10 minutes. “By our most optimistic estimates, as early as 2027 a quantum computer could exist that can break the elliptic curve signature scheme in less than 10 minutes, the block time used in Bitcoin.” (page 2 of this paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf)) 

So that looks like ECDSA itself could be broken sooner if a quantum computer would have, for example 100 minutes to derive a private key from a public key. Is that correct? Would the needed calculation power be available sooner than the speed that would be necessary to break BTC?

Explaining Quantum &amp; Post-Quantum Crypto to a new audience,1532578461,"Hi quantum and post-quantum cryptographers,

I recently had a talk to discuss quantum computing accepted into an event at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors nuclear material around the world. When you plan out nuclear power plants and disposal sites and inspections over decades, it makes sense to think about post-quantum crypto sooner rather than later.

I'm a coder, not a physicist or a mathematician. I've enjoyed reading the less-mathy parts which I can understand of *Post-Quantum Cryptography* (2008) and *Quantum Computing since Democritus*. I know that NIST is reviewing proposals for a post-quantum crypto standard. I will borrow Aaronson's point that quantum is not ""trying all solutions at once"".

"Feasibility of quantum computers, given our understanding of quantum mechanics.",1532356166,"I'm not a physicist, nor have I studied quantum mechanics. Every academic source I've read, it seems like quantum computing is only theoretically feasible. Worse yet, it seems like from the quantum physics aspect, very little is known, and many ideas haven't been verified experimentally. The LHC experiment happened a decade ago was meant to answer fundamental questions and verify things we don't know yet. So it seems like from the quantum mechanics and physics, many fundamental questions still haven't been answered.

My question then becomes, how can we possibly have companies like D-Wave and Google claiming to have quantum computers, when our understanding of physics isn't there yet? Are we that confident in our models? It seems like there is a lot of experimental knowledge that is missing, so how can we possibly jump to quantum computing?

Moreover, there are several types of quantum papers I've seen, one of them is in quantum algorithms. Quantum algorithms are based on assumptions about properties that quantum computers might have.

Question: are there any numbers about basic quantum operations performance?,1531731305,"Good day,

I'm looking for numbers of basic quantum operation execution time. 

For.ex. in C# on my laptop I can add two numbers in some nanoseconds, reach db in milliseconds, implement web-request in seconds. There are benchmarks for almost everything: processor commands execution, processor cash access, memory read, memory write, hard-drive read\\write, etc.

Is there any info for quantum computers performance? How much time is taken for One\\Zero state setup? How much time is taken for Bell State setup? How much time is taken for a measurement? For 2 qubits entanglement? For NOT gate? For CCNOT gate? Is there any parallelism for qubit state setup? 

Based on this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/8v3nix/how_long_will_it_take_for_a_quantum_computer_to/) some years are required for a one large int factorization, so setup time doesn't look important.

Here's a brief explanation:

""In classical physics, the possible states of a system of *n* particles, whose individual states can be described by a vector in a two-dimensional vector space, form a vector space of 2*n* dimensions. However, in a quantum system the resulting state space is much larger; a system of *n* qubits has a state space of 2^(n) dimensions.

That we go from a base 2 number system that computers know to a base 3, 4, possibly 5 system.  Or is it that we may soon get from a 50 q-bit system to a 100 x 1000 q-bit system?

I ask because I've always thought that a capacitance based computer could easily get to a 100 base system much cheaper and with some of the advances in carbon super capacitors be much cheaper.  To me a fundamental difference would be to change the base number of computing.  In addition I understand that increasing the byte of the processing will help 32 to 64, though that is also a memory addressing issue, that I think could be changed to parallel compute?

Problem calculating state of 2-qubit system,1528544347,"Hello everyone,

I'm studying the basics of quantum computing and have run into a bit of a problem.

I have the following [quantum circuit](https://ibb.co/hEhmso) and I need to calculate the values of the two qubits afterwards.

Now, I know what those [values are](https://ibb.co/nv4fk8). It was simple enough to calculate, and I checked it on a [simulator](http://algassert.com/quirk#circuit=%7B%22cols%22%3A%5B%5B1%2C%22X%22%5D%2C%5B%22%E2%80%A2%22%2C%22X%22%5D%2C%5B1%2C%22X%22%5D%2C%5B%22H%22%5D%5D%7D) just to make sure.

The trouble I'm getting into is when I try to express this as a two qubit system.

As I understand it should be expressed like [this](https://ibb.co/mOeD58), where **|ψ'&gt;** is the state after the circuit is complete, **|ψ&gt; = |00&gt;** is the initial state, and **M** is the matrix representing the combined effect of all the gates of the circuit.

I calculate **M** like [this](https://ibb.co/fdnY58), writing the **CNOT** matrix in block matrix form here, and extracting the **1/sqrt(2)** from **H** to the beginning.

Now I plug **M** back in the first equation like [so](
https://ibb.co/chs0k8), and don't get the expected solution.

Where am I at fault?

Cheers,
L. Aleksic

P.S.
If anyone could tell me how to embed the images with the circuit and the latex equations directly in the post, I would be very grateful.

"What is it that unlocks the ""2^N"" power potential of N qubits?",1526610860,"I'm just starting to learn about Q#, QASM, and have been testing ideas on the IBM Q Experience. I came across something which hit me on [IBM Q Documentation](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/tutorial?sectionId=full-user-guide&amp;page=003-Multiple_Qubits_Gates_and_Entangled_States~2F042-Non-Clifford_Gates):
  
""Up to this point, all the gates we have discussed (X,Y,Z,H,S,S†, and CNOT) are members of a special group of gates known as the Clifford group. These gates can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer (see the Gottesman-Knill theorem). Therefore, the Clifford group is not universal. It cannot harness the full power of quantum computation; for that, we must include at least one non-Clifford gate in our circuits ... The T gate essentially makes it possible to reach all different points of the Bloch sphere.""
  
It then presents a visual aid showing how more locations become possible with more T gate operations.
  
Then I read [this](https://earltcampbell.com/research/magic-states/):
  
""There are entangled states and coherent superposition states that are not magical, and using only these states will give no quantum speed-up over traditional computing. To me, this signals that thinking about magic states teaches us something that is missed when we learn about entanglement or coherence ... zero-magic states forming an eight sided shape called an octahedron. For states outside the octahedron, the amount of magic increases with the distance from the octahedron.""
  
OK, so something fundamental is expressed there. I am trying to get to that ""aha"" moment where I fully realize what it means and how to use it. Let me see if I partially understand it. First, you need Hadamard (H) gates to put the qubits into superposition; second, you need to entangle qubits using CNOT gates. Third, you must use a non-Clifford gate (T gate in this case) to perform ""non-trivial rotations"". The Bloch sphere is only useful as a visual aid with 1 qubit's rotations, so I've no idea how to visualize the entangled pair or how further operations affect the pair in terms of the ""dots"" in the [original image](https://imgur.com/a/HzIB7Jn).
  
The more you entangle and perform T rotations, the more you open up the quantum possibility space? I'm currently thinking of this in a simplified manner: there are 3 trivial axis where rotation doesn't really get you anywhere by themselves; by using rotations by the T gate which are not axis-aligned, you create another axis or dimension of freedom in the possibility space. When this is done on entangled qubits, and the maximum possibility space is opened up, it approaches degrees of freedom 2^N for N qubits; this also seems related to the systems being ""universal""? Or rather, any quantum gate set which can accomplish this, is a ""universal gate set"", which to me means being able to unlock the ""full quantum magic"" discussed in the article.
  
I'm still missing some key insight though. Looking at popular quantum algorithms hasn't helped me understand it so far. I get that the goal is usually to manipulate the probabilities so that they converge on a correct answer, but I don't see how this process is unfolding via the quantum code or how adding more qubits is affecting it.",QuantumComputing,BinaryAlgorithm,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/8k9vc5/what_is_it_that_unlocks_the_2n_power_potential_of/,7

I’m having trouble wrapping my head around QC. a quantum computer uses a qubit for its zero and one states. The zero and one states are hard to measure. Some use photons, others are measuring subatomic particles? 

This would mean we are taking measurements at the nanoscale? 

OK. why are we using these mediums for measurements? Shouldn’t we be using something that can process faster than a classical computer? 

Then we have the issue of probability and the issues with measurements. Once we have a full measurement the quantum state collapses. So why not build out something using carbon nanotubes and manipulate those since they’re also subatomic?

Quantum Computation as Cryptocurrency Proof of Work,1526076544,"I had a thought the other day and after doing a bit of research thought I'd post/ask here.

My idea is to use simulated quantum computation as a cryptocurrency proof of work to incentivize the development of better quantum simulators and eventually quantum chips. I mean if people are throwing all this money at mining why not incentivize something good with it?

Here's what would be needed:

 * An unavoidably slow computation, at least on classical computers. It could perhaps be accelerated with GPUs or ASICs but not significantly.

 * A computation that can be simulated with one of many QC simulator libraries with enough accuracy to permit verification of the result and without unacceptable memory or time requirements. (E.g. run time on the order of seconds.)

 * A computation that would be enormously faster on a quantum chip with a sufficient number of qubits... and ideally maybe one where the speedup would scale with the number of qubits in some way to incentivize better QC chips.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Units of Magnetic Pole Strength,1525833723,"I was reading Maxwell's treatise on electromagnetism, and on Page 3 of Volume 2, he does a bit of dimensional analysis on the units of magnetic pole strength, using the following formula:

f = (m1 m2)/l2,

where m1 and m2 are the strengths of two magnetic poles, l is the distance between the poles, and f is the resultant magnetic force between the two poles.

The full treatise is available here (see page 3):

https://archive.org/details/electricityndmag02maxwrich

Let F denote the units of force, L denote the units of meters, and m denote the units of magnetic pole strength.

Maxwell notes that,

F = m2 / L2,

which implies that,

m = L√F.

Because force equals mass times acceleration, it follows that F has units of (kg L)/T2, where kg is kilograms and T is seconds.

Therefore,

m = L√((kg L) / T2) = (L3/2√kg) / T.

Interestingly, Maxwell's treatise was published in 1881, prior to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, which was published in 1905.
Armed with the fact that E = Mc2, we can continue Maxwell's analysis. Let J denote the units of Joules. It follows that,

m = √(JL).

That is, this analysis implies that the strength of a magnetic pole has units of the square root of Joules times meters.

Has anyone come across similar analysis on the units of magnetic pole strength? My understanding is that this unit of measure fell out of favor, for whatever reason. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of producing a very simple equation for the force due to magnetic attraction / repulsion.

Time-Dilation and the Photoelectric Effect,1524085255,"Hi All,

I've found some sources that I think shed some light on the discussion we had regarding whether or not time-dilation impacts the photoelectric effect.

To quickly recap, I can't find any sources that say affirmatively that it does, and there don't seem to be any experiments on point. Also, the general formulation of the equation for the photoelectric effect (originally penned by Einstein himself) omits the Lorentz factor gamma. However, I have found sources that suggest it would be very surprising if the photoelectric effect were not affected by time-dilation.

Specifically, check out Section 11.5 on page 4 of the following re the energy emitted / absorbed by an Fe atom:

http://web.mit.edu/8.13/www/JLExperiments/JLExp13.pdf

Similar reasoning applies to the threshold frequency of a metal.

Amazingly, if this is true, this suggests that a current could be generated between two identical metal plates simply because there at different heights from the surface of the Earth (time-dilation varies at different heights in a gravitational field, thereby creating different work functions in the two plates, and therefore a difference in potential between the two plates, which would cause a current to flow if they're connected).

What do you all think of this? Seems like either way, something interesting follows: either there's an exception to relativity, or there's a pretty easy way to generate electricity!

Why doesn't time-dilation impact the threshold frequency of the photoelectric effect?,1523544544,"Hi All,

The threshold frequency of a material is determined by the binding energy of the electrons within the atoms within the material. As far as I can tell, the binding energy of an electron is not impacted in any way by the velocity of an atom. This implies that the threshold frequency of an atom is also not impacted by the velocity of an atom, which implies that time-dilation has no impact on the threshold frequency of an atom.

How could this be the case if time as measured within the atom as a general matter should be impacted by time-dilation? The Mossbauer rotor experiments show that time-dilation does affect resonance frequencies of atoms, so why doesn't it impact the threshold frequency of an atom?

I could of course be missing something, so I thought I'd ask the community for insights on this.

For those that are interested, I came across this in connection with my research applying information theory to time-dilation (the working paper is here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323684258_A_Computational_Model_of_Time-Dilation)",QuantumComputing,Feynmanfan85,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/8bqpyh/why_doesnt_timedilation_impact_the_threshold/,32

Trying to understand the superiority of qbits over analog signaling..,1523046554,"As far as I understood, unlike binary logic of a classical computer, qbits are not in a specific on/off state.

I wanted to understand how is this different from an analog electric signal.

An analog signal can be on (usually this is 5 volts) or off (0 volts), but it can also be anywhere in between, (2 volts, 3 volts), etc. You can measure the signal with a volt meter.

The problem with using analog signals is noise. The further distance you have to send the signal, the more noise will be introduced to the system.

That's why digital signals are used instead.

I am trying to understand, do qbits not have this noise problem?

If not, it sounds like they will be limited, the same way that analog computers were.",QuantumComputing,litehacker,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/8actmj/trying_to_understand_the_superiority_of_qbits/,11

Planck's constant as the minimum energy,1522682341,"Hi All,

As noted in a previous post that readers of this sub-reddit seemed to enjoy, I've been working on applications of information theory to physics. Interestingly, I've realized that my work implies that the minimum energy for any particle is h/(1 second). That is, the minimum energy for any particle is Planck's constant with units of Joules.

I know that this is not how Planck's constant is typically interpreted, but it sheds light on Planck's equation E = hf, and suggests that Planck's equation is a measure of a rate of energy. That is, a photon packs an energy of h Joules per second, for a total of hf Joules in the entire photon. This suggests that photons could be a discrete packet of wave crests, each with an energy of h. Your thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.

So that being said the computer science department here lets me take 12 hours of any major that is related to computer science or computation in any way. I'm thinking about doing either Physics or Math. Which one should I do? While it seems like Physics is just in general cool, Math seems just as, if not more important, if I'm going to be working on quantum computing with a CS perspective.

Just some perspective of what I've done till now as far as classes go. I've done the base linear algebra course. I've taken discrete mathematics. Taken intro to programming (I'd like to say I'm decent at writing code and do projects from time to time, but the more I get into CS the more I see code is not nearly as important as the concepts and math behind everything).

Deciding on a PhD that would help me towards a profession in quantum computing.,1520965456,"My ultimate goal is to have a career in the devices side of quantum computing. Perhaps be involved in the design and fabrication of quantum gates and/or quantum processors. Currently, I have two main offers for a PhD that I am having trouble choosing because I do not know which would contribute more toward my goal.

One option is to do a PhD in experimental graphene research. Though not directly connected to quantum computing, I have the opportunity to spend half of the amount of terms in another country and get two PhDs, one in my home country and another at a partner institution outside of the country. Keep in mind that my home institution for this program is one of the best universities in the country when it comes to physics. Also,
there are plenty of connections to people in quantum computing available at this institution.

The other choice is to go to a lesser known school where I would pursue theoretical research in quantum dots. In this program, a physics prof would supervise me on the quantum dots research while a cross-appointed math prof, whose specialization is quantum encryption, would supervise me on the algorithmic side of my project. This research would be directly involved in quantum computing.

Do I choose the better school that has more connections to the industry, two PhDs with the opportunity to live in another continent and whose name is more recognized or the school that has far less connections, one PhD, but whose research is in the field of quantum computing?

Week 35 discussion: A CNOT gate between multiphoton qubits encoded in two cavities,1519175393,"A CNOT gate is applied on two logical qubits that are encoded in a cavity mode. This method of error correction is different from standard methods like the surface code because it corrects for errors at the hardware level.

Question from a Beginner at Quantum Logic,1519174106,"I don't think I understand exactly what is meant by the tensor product. I understand the broader definition, but the tensor product by itself is a general type of operation on vector spaces. If I give you two vectors, how do I find/use their tensor product?

So say I have the CNOT gate, which is a 4x4 matrix, and two qubits, say |0&gt; and a|0&gt;+b|1&gt;. How do I calculate what combined qubit state the outputs will be if I put the combined state a|0&gt;+b|1&gt; (tensor) |0&gt; into the CNOT gate?

Do I use the Kronecker product as the tensor and then apply the CNOT matrix? If so, then why not clarify that the tensor product is specifically the Kronecker product?",QuantumComputing,Cobalt_000,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/7z19o2/question_from_a_beginner_at_quantum_logic/,4

Amdahl's Law for Quantum Computing,1515665915,"So far I do not know much about Quantum Computing besides the very basics of superposition and entanglement, but we just had Amdahl's Law as a topic. 
Basically, Amdahl's Law states one processor can be divided into a sequential and parallel part. While the commands in the sequential part can only be executed one after another, the commands in the parallel part can be ""parallelised"" (we don't learn this in english), which basically means the use of more processors will increase the working speed, but only of the parallel part.
Now the question is, can Quantum Computing also affect the sequential part (as far as I understood, it can), and are there any laws for that? Like a modified law. Or is it just to new of a topic?

He wanted to write a program using arrays, but he didn’t know what an array was. So what did he do? He associated each element of the array with a unique prime number, then he multiplied them all together; then, whenever he wanted to read something out of the array, he factored the product.

Probability based results of quantum computing experiments,1513533312,"I assume that the theory of the probabilities assigned to certain states was experimentally confirmed through multiple measurements, and the results of multiple experiments converged to theoretically predicted probability distributions.

However, we do not really know whether the results of quantum experiments are obtained randomly according to the theoretical probability distributions, at least not in all cases. What if there are some mystical contextual factors involved in the selection of the outcomes that might manipulate the contexts in which correct and incorrect solutions are provided? Any practical quantum computing protocol must decide upon a finite number of repetitions of the experiment to make; what ""confidence"" they wish to have in the result...

from what i've been told the problem is that if you measure the quantum state of one of the pairs you know the state of both, but the fact that you have measured one side still needs to be communicated by traditional means.

but what if you created pairs and each entangled pair was sort of stored in a capsule (at nano scale of course) and had a unique ID, so two capsules will have each ID as they are the pairs, then you took half of them with you somewhere distant along with a ledger of unique ID to timestamp, and both ends of the relay would be able to measure a specific pair at a specific time pre-determind. of course this might make these capsules disposable but with enough of them you should be able to perhaps give all odd numbers to one side and even to the other, they will invoke a specific state before the time the capsule is measured. 

would like to know what i am missing that would make this not work :) if there's a better place to ask this let me know",QuantumComputing,ericalansolo,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/7jacdx/why_not_ftl_communication/,13

So we set our qubits in superposition and entangled each other (so we have a ""Graph"" now, right?)
How we find our solution?
How we find the shortest path?
I know that the qubits being in superposition and entangled have the whole spectrum of possible paths (so also our path too!!)

First: we've to misuse the qubits right? But how? How is made measure in a quantum computer?

Second: when to do this measure? After 1 second we set our qubits?

Qubits and Superpositions,1510438376,"I'm currently implementing a basic quantum computer simulation to understand the concepts better.

I know that a superposition of n qubits can be represented as a vector of complex numbers of which each index represents a possible state (viewed in binary form) and the values (which are complex numbers) indirectly represent the probabilities of the associated states. Quantum gates can be applied using matrix-vector multiplication.

In a quantum circuit, though, qubits are sometimes combined using binary gates and then again individually manipulated using unary gates. Phrased differently, what do I do when I have a quantum superposition of 2 qubits and a gate that operates on 1 qubit if I want it to operate only on the second qubit? This lead me to the following question:

How do I combine two superpositions of qubits and how do I split them again into separate superpositions while preserving the correct probabilities?

"This is bold to ask, but can someone ELI5 what Quantum Computing is better at than a regular computer?",1509562260,"So I understand, roughly speaking, that a Quantum Computer is better at reducing the number of operations required to solve a problem, but it takes longer to accomplish any one individual operation.

I want to understand what that means in the context of solving problems. What kind of problems, other than complex calculations, could you put in for solutions? It seems to me that the only real use people have found for it is to run a bunch of simulations or scenarios and have the computer find the most optimal results. It's a really good number cruncher essentially?

The more I think about it, the less I understand. I'm also coming from a perspective outside the scientific community, so any ability to contextually relate it to actual quantum mechanics and the implications are over my head. As in if something is obvious because it is similar to some formula or use from quantum mechanics, I really have no idea and would love an explanation.

About boolean algebra and quantum computing,1504976950,"The primitiv datatype of boolean algebra is the bit.

One way to understand the quantum bit is to consider what would happen if we could split a function like boolean negation into 2 equal parts, that when composed, are equal to the negation. f ° f = ¬.

Quantum computing explain the trick : we have to use probability density, ie (complex) number whose square are probability. This way, a negation that is represented by the folowing matrice : 

    (0,1)
    (1,0) 

can be split into 2 equal matrix whose product is the original negation :

(EDITED because mistake)

    ((1+i)/2 , (1-i)/2)
    ((1-i)/2 , (1+i)/2)

It looks like we can apply an operation such as the boolean negation a rational number of time ! (EDIT : I've checked 1/3,  1/4 and 1/5.)

I'm wondering what the usual conjunction would be like, if generalized to Qbit. Can we do it only halfway ? Is there a way to have sqrt(2) bits in between 1 and 2 ? Or is it hopeless since quantum computing prevent information loss ?

What I don’t understand is how a computer could understand, become faster by, or even use the superposition of a 0 and a 1.

In this case, does it work because you have a string of entangled qubits, and you are able to alter their entanglement so that their readings agree with a certain function?

Looking into a possible career change,1504568620,"Hey all,

I'm a 28 year old animator, and the more I learn about Quantum Computing, the more I see it as such a huge, new frontier for advancement in the world.

I have played with the idea of possibly looking into a career change, but I realize it would take essentially a whole new round of schooling. My main question is, if someone WERE to do this, what might be the best path to take? 

From school choices, majors, etc?

I just had a random thought and would gladly hear if my theory would work in the future.,1501612808,"I'm very interested into future games and I know quantum computing isnt the computer we need for the future. At least that's what we think. 

My idea is only based on fantasy and I have no real understanding how a quantum computer really works but I've always been curious and have watch documentarys about them. 

Back to my idea, 

Let's say we build a quantum computer that has a lot of horse power in like ""computing power"". We basically can generate every possible possbility at an update rate of 120 or something. . 

Wouldn't it be possible to send code into this that telling the quantum computer what possiblitity we want to project, we talk with the quantum computer and it lets us generate the world for us when we asks for it. 


I know, this is probably extremly hard to understand what I mean since my native language isn't english but what I'm trying is to say if a quamtum computer would be possible to generate a consistent 120 updates a second or more, generating all possibilitys inside a game, this world can then be manipuleated for the end-user playing it on their CPU based PC.

Do Qubits entangle only entangle after being told to by the human operating the quantum computer (scenario 1) or can they entangle and decohere and be all fluid with their entanglements without a person even knowing (scenario 2)
Scenario one: the quantum computer is off. You entangle some qubits inside it, and then turn it on. The bits then function, and can perhaps decohere, but can not entangle with new qubits that they weren't entangled with before while the machine is in use, at least not without having been told to by the human operating the computer.

Scenario 2: like scenario 1, but with the added possibility: machine is turned on, qubits can also entangle by themselves! Entanglements could be formed and broken from complex interactions with each other without the human operator even knowing, but could also be pre-entangled before the experiment.",QuantumComputing,massivebrain,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/6jepzv/entanglement_on_the_fly_from_interactions_or/,12

* Math
* Computer Engineering
* Computer Science
* Electrical Engineering

Currently my interests lie far more in computer hardware than software

Also, a follow-up question if you will: I know that university prestige is a major factor in some industries and not a major player in others. Is quantum computing a selective enough field that prestige matters? Or is it not a big concern? I am currently looking at schools like Stanford and MiT but (of course, like with any candidate) these types of schools are an absolute craps shoot and who knows where I will end up. Thoughts?

Time-independent Hamiltonians for Grover's algorithm and NP-completeness,1490754724,"Here's an argument against the possibility of implementing Grover's algorithm as a time-independent Hamiltonian.

Let n be the number of qubits and N=2ⁿ.  A time-independent Hamiltonian that implements Grover's algorithm will be of the form 

&gt; H = I + ε (|end&gt;&lt;start|-|start&gt;&lt;end|)  

(see https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0004091).  The eigenvectors of H with nonzero eigenvalues are very nearly

&gt; |±&gt; = 1/√(2)(|end&gt; ± i|start&gt;);

the corresponding eigenvalues are very nearly ±π.  The initial state is

&gt; |start&gt; = - i/√(2) (|+&gt; - |-&gt;),

a uniform superposition of the two eigenvectors that cancels out the marked state.  Over a time T=O(sqrt(N)), it evolves to the marked state.

However, a measurement of the energy of the initial state under the time-independent Hamiltonian for Grover's algorithm will collapse it to one of |+&gt; and |-&gt;.  Measuring the energy of a state under this Hamiltonian takes constant time independent of N, because they differ from ±π by an exponentially small amount.  This isn't true of Farhi and Gutmann's ""analog analogue"" of Grover's algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9612026) because the energies of the two states differ from each other by an exponentially small amount; measuring the energy difference under their Hamiltonian takes an exponentially long time.

When measuring either |+&gt; or |-&gt; in the qubit basis, we get the marked state with probability 1/2.  This would essentially allow quantum computers to solve NP-complete problems in constant time, so that's a strong argument against it being possible to implement Grover's algorithm as a time-independent Hamiltonian.  More precisely, it would say that NP is in BQP.

One way I can see that the argument above could fail is due to a branch cut: a unitary operation is generated by lots of Hamiltonians whose eigenvalues differ by 2π.  If the eigenvalues are not ±(π - ε) but rather π ± ε, then the energy gap is exponentially small, just like Farhi and Gutmann's Hamiltonian. 

[These guys](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610130) claim to have designed a time-independent implementation of Grover's algorithm, but I haven't worked out what the eigenvalues of their Hamiltonian are.

    Grover's algorithm on a Feynman computer
    Diego de Falco, Dario Tamascelli

    We present an implementation of Grover's algorithm in the framework of
    Feynman's cursor model of a quantum computer. The cursor degrees of
    freedom act as a quantum clocking mechanism, and allow Grover's
    algorithm to be performed using a single, time-independent
    Hamiltonian. We examine issues of locality and resource usage in
    implementing such a Hamiltonian. In the familiar language of
    Heisenberg spin-spin coupling, the clocking mechanism appears as an
    excitation of a basically linear chain of spins, with occasional
    controlled jumps that allow for motion on a planar graph: in this
    sense our model implements the idea of ""timing"" a quantum algorithm
    using a continuous-time random walk. In this context we examine some
    consequences of the entanglement between the states of the
    input/output register and the states of the quantum clock.

Deriving information from quantum entanglement | Screw EPR,1489767369,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKvjIsyYng8

So i was browsing through YouTube, stumbled upon this video. After watching it, a thought induced, suggesting a way to derive useful information from a system of entangled particles by collapsing the superposition.
The EPR Paradox intervenes and declines the possibility of inferring information from the superposition collapse, as the before and after states of the entangled particles are completely random to the observer.
This video suggested ways of constructing a binary system, that can give consistent answers, even when ulu and ozo are unknown. So is there a way using quantum gates, and entangled particles to derive useful information from the system?

third, what qualifies as an observation? if I dont wear my glasses and cant make out the number on a card, but I know that its red, is that enough to change its value? what if I see it, but I cant make out anything about it?

As a computer scientist, I was intrigued and started reading up on quantum computers. Then I ran into another article from 2015 (http://www.sciencealert.com/australian-engineers-have-put-quantum-technology-in-a-silicon-chip-for-the-first-time) about scientists who had developed a quantum logic gate in silicon.

Are quantum computers really possible?,1485886613,"So far, this universe has visibly followed the laws of logic. I am unsure if quantum computers are really possible. I wouldn't expect scientists to lie, but I also wouldn't expect the laws of logic to be broken by the laws of physics.

A key tenant of quantum computers is that the same particles exist in multiple exclusive states at the same time, so a particle can be simultaneously only in a 1 state and only in a 0 state at the same time, which is logically impossible. Quantum superposition is logically impossible because it says x does not equal x, or that one particle can be in more than one state at one time.

What worries me is that it takes an expert to experimentally falsify quantum theory, anyone attempting to can be claimed to have just found a 'kink' in quantum theory or our understanding, or have made a mistake in their experiments or rigged their equipment, quantum events are conveniently all outside of the realm of our direct observation and the experimenters might be able to make their own (rigged) equipment, like fake quantum computers that are less powerful than classical computers. This all seems to make it possible for scientists to fake their research and experiments on the quantum scale. Also, if any groups are clever enough to figure out how to fake something, make it beneficial to them, and cover it up, it's scientists. Donald Trump's president of the US, so incompetence, inadequacy or corruption is very high and very real.

I wanted to present my engineering understanding of QCs and hopefully you can correct me where I go wrong.

Start with a low noise wire, attach it to a single atom in its lowest energy state (maybe boron or some sort of dopant). Add several noiseless wires and low energy atoms in series. Apply an electric field across the both ends of the noiseless wires so that each atom has a different potential to satisfy (this electric field encodes a question to be answered). The atoms minimize there new potential energy with the emission of light and detectors near each atom are positioned to record this light. The atoms new minimum potential energies correspond with the answer to a given question. At best, this measurement accuracy will be limited to Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle but in reality, there is a lot of noise and significant errors in the measurement. 

There are also other architectures that I know close to nothing about. ",QuantumComputing,Throwawayof2016,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/5kroel/my_ignorant_understanding_of_the_engineering_of/,0

For clarification this will be rather basic level research.  And while QC is something that I am interested in I currently do not see it as more of an idle hobby.

It will not be cutting edge research just a way for me to get a broader understanding about how QC algorithms work.

DNA as storage for quantum computer,1480263385,"So I've come across stories of scientists storing massive amounts of data in DNA. I've heard of both petabytes and exabytes in a gram. 
From what I know about quantum computing, there are 4 states, rather than 2 in current computing, 1 and 0. DNA pieces essentially have 4 states as well, acting as a storage medium. My question is this: with the nature of quantum computing, would it be ideal to use DNA as storage because of its 4 states? And of course the amazing compactness of it.

Or... Does the computer just use quantum states to store info? Or just for processing?

And let's assume the DNA can be reasonably manipulated timely and accurately",QuantumComputing,spideyface,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/5f5zz3/dna_as_storage_for_quantum_computer/,7

Intuition for solving problems with quantum computers?,1473564465,"Hello. My background is in programming, not physics. I've been trying to understand how you actually solve problems with quantum computers. I'm not looking so much for a math/physics class, but more of an intuition of how you do these things from an algorithms point of view.

I keep reading articles and seeing videos that say N qubits can all be put in superpositions, representing 2^N numbers at once, so you can compute 2^N solutions at once. But they always stop there. How do you ask N qubits a question and how do you extract the answer? If you do math on them, don't you just end up with N qubits representing 2^N answers? What would you do with that?

In this video, Eric Ladizinsky says that the D-Wave computer encodes an ""energy landscape"" that represents a problem and that the ""lowest valley"" in the landscape is the answer to the problem. Is this a good example? Can anyone give a basic idea of how you would do this?

Just a thought: Quantum Computing and network traffic and hashes,1472501761,"I recently have watched some videos on quantum computing and have some thought.

Now, I am not sure how hashes work (MD5, SHA1SUM ...etc) but from what I understand the hash represents the identical binaries of the original copy. 
(let's say you want to download Manjaro Linux) This is the hash:  
SHA1SUM: c4204cb831b32f2a6a72cfe52ef59847e50e0035

With cryptography, I learned that a quantum computer will be able to know the private key within minutes! and decrypt almost anything, then this thought came to my head

Would this kind of computer be able to reverse the hash of files into binaries? That would decrease the internet traffic, because you'll just copy the hash and paste it and let the computer do it's job. It may take as much time as if you download the file, but less traffic.

I hope you understood what I was talking about, if not this is a simple way:

old fashion way:
a file on a server (100GB) &gt; coping all binaries through cables &gt; my computer
         Time: 5 hours
         Traffic: alot

future fashion way:
a file on a server (100GB) &gt; copying only the hash &gt; my quantum computer(and starting making the file) 
          Time: 5 hours (maybe less I don't know)
          Traffic: almost none

Any thoughts?

[Quantum Computing] What is the difference between the detection of the value of a Qubit indirectly with Entanglement and directly measuring it?,1472316872,"[This](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/quantum-computer1.htm) source explained that by entangling two atoms, it is possible to measure A and know the value of B without actually having to look at it, because it will always take the opposite value of A. Here's the extract from the page:


&gt; In quantum physics, if you apply an outside force to two atoms, it can cause them to become entangled, and the second atom can take on the properties of the first atom. So if left alone, an atom will spin in all directions. The instant it is disturbed it chooses one spin, or one value; and at the same time, the second entangled atom will choose an opposite spin, or value. This allows scientists to know the value of the qubits without actually looking at them.

I'm not asking for a debate on whether D-wave works, but whether it can possibly make sense to talk about quantum speed ups without entanglement. 

As far as I can tell, the reason quantum systems are hard to simulate compared to classical systems is the exponential increase in complexity that comes from entanglement.  In the simple case of qubits, you can simulate a single  unentangled qubit pretty well and if you had 1000 of such qubits you could simulate them independently with a constant overhead.  The issue occurs when, and only when, the qubits are entangled.

"I am a middle schooler who is passionate about quantum computing. Many questions, please help.",1465193733,"Hi reddit. Like the title says, I am a middle schooler. Although this may take many to surprise, please don't ignore this or treat me as a ""kid"" by saying ""oh you don't have to worry about this yet, wait until college"" or ""why are you trying to figure this out"". I am genuinely passionate in Math, Computer Science, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and Physics, which the internet has led me to the quantum computing field. I have immediately fell in love with this, and I am seeking help from you guys to enhance my knowledge on quantum computing.
First off, I do not know linear algebra. I am in middle school, and although (I am not trying to be cocky) compared to my classmates, I think I am advanced in math. I have studied up to pre-calculus on my own, and I have spent time with graphs and parabolas. I have read articles, read (not quantum computing, but quantum theory and physics) books, watched videos behind the basic construction of a qubit and its superposition. I have visited https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020535/http://www.dwavesys.com/en/dev-tutorials.html to try and learn the Quantum Computing Language, but I am usually unable to understand some of the material due to the mathematics being too advanced for me.
I am writing to ask experts wether learning linear algebra is a necessity, and if so, I was wondering wether people know any websites whee I can learn the linear algebra required for learning the quantum computing language.
I am also wondering wether anyone knows a good different website for me to learn the Quantum Computing Language. I live near a university which I believe has a small group of people researching quantum computing. I would love to visit their laboratory and possibly learning more on the hardware of QCs as well. I think that being able to know the language would be a powerful skill that I can provide to those people in order to possibly be allowed to visit the laboratory. 
Also in general, I was wondering wether there is a good website that explains where we are at quantum computing, such as if we can use QCs to analyze big data or if we are close enough to make an operating system for it that people around the world can use. 
I want to know what people can do using QCs and what potential there is in QC.
To summarize, I want to know how I can learn the linear algebra required for understanding QCL without even having a proper geometry education yet (although I have taught myself up to Pre-Calculus), and I also want to know if there is a QCL guide for beginners, and I also want to know where we are at for QC, and where we can go, and where there is potential in QC that can cause a computing revolution, and enhance daily lives of humans. 
Again, I may be a small kid, but I am genuinely passionate about this subject and I feel that I can really spend hours and hours a day researching this subject. I am asking anyone who believes that I can pursue my dreams for help. In fact, even just a simple reply would be world changing to me, and give me hope. Quantum Computing means a lot to me. For the first time in my life, I feel that I have found something that i can invest hundreds of thousands of hours into. I feel that this is something that I want to do for the rest of my life, and I feel really good that I have found what if for me. And if someone can help, it would really fuel me to pursue this dream of mine.",QuantumComputing,qctum,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/4mrlcs/i_am_a_middle_schooler_who_is_passionate_about/,14

I'm not convinced that Boson Sampling is #P. Can anyone convince me otherwise?,1464950604,"Scott makes two arguments.  

1. Finding the probability of any given state |s&gt; requires calculating the matrix permanent. If this could be done in polynomial time then the poly hierarchy collapses.  

2. If you could do Boson Sampling classically in poly time then you could simulate any Quantum Optical Circuit with post selection. KLM implies that this would let you simulate a universal quantum computer in polynomial time. BQP goes down to P and the poly hierarchy collapses again.  

Here's where I disagree. 

1. You might not need to calculate the probability of any particular state to sample from the probability distribution. Therefore you do not need to calculate the permanents to sample the distribution. For instance suppose in polynomial time I could find the relative probabilities of states A and B (P(A)/P(B)). Notice that from this info I cannot infer either P(A) or P(B). From here I could use the metropolis method to build a markov chain which lets me sample from P(X) without ever computing any particular P(X). Furthermore if I tried to reconstruct the distribution by way of sampling it over and over again I would have to take an exponential number of samples. In short, sampling a distribution is different than calculating said distribution. Scott showed that calculating the distribution is #P.  

2. LOQC with post selection is exponentially unlikely to work. Therefore you must make an exponential number of oracle calls (aka run your boson sampler exponential times) to simulate a universal quantum computer in this fashion. Therefore if I found a classical algo for Boson Sampling, BQP would still be out of reach and the polynomial Christmas tree would stay upright. 

Edit: I think I'm convinced now. Unless someone else has a counterargument for likesparsnips",QuantumComputing,IIAOPSW,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/4mcb0m/im_not_convinced_that_boson_sampling_is_p_can/,11

Recommendation for a book on Quantum Computing for beginners.,1462930372,"Hi guys/gals, 

Can any of you recommend a books or articles or youtube videos that explain Quantum Computing for a beginner/layman? 

I have a degree in math and remember most of my A'level physics.

I read Code by Charles Petzold to get the basics of how a normal computer works. 

I then read Computing with Quantum Cats and lots of articles online and I kinda get the idea about superposition and having different probabilities for each state. 

What I can't really get an understanding of is 

1. How does a Quantum Computer consider all the possibilities at once? 

2. How at the end when you get the answer does it get the right answer? From what I understand it only probabilistically gets the right answer. And has something to do with observation collapsing the wave function of probabilities?

3. How does that allow it to possibly crack RSA encryption? Shor's algorithm I think?

Thanks

Quantum Gate Emulation on a classical machine in python.,1450671968,"Hello! I recently found a code example based on a talk by michael nielsen and have been extending it in order to emulate [quantum logical gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gate). 

I'd love to get some feedback from the experts on whether this is working properly or not and if there are ways I can improve it. 

You can find my code [on GitHub](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Quantum-Simulator)

I just have some questions for how to emulate the actions of some of those gates. 

Specifically the Pauli gates. 

So the X Gate, does this just swap the amplitudes of all qubits in the system? As in literally swapping the amplitudes of the 000 state and the 111 states? How is this realized for the 010 state or the 101 state? Are those amplitudes swapped as well since they're direct complements? 

The Y gate looks like it just does the same as the X but just multiplies the amplitude of the corresponding 1 but by i and -i according to the wiki page. 

Lastly with the Z gate, does is obvious if the other two work the way I imagine.

Thanks in advance for any help! Love this subreddit. ",QuantumComputing,Duskmon,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/3xnuv1/quantum_gate_emulation_on_a_classical_machine_in/,7

Theoretically, it should return 1 on every output, since the function f is balanced. But it's not what happens. Instead, I get two qubits which both have a 50% probability of turning out being in a 1 or in a 0 state.

They are, however, entangled to always be in the same state.

Quantum Computing newbie asking a question,1449592546,"I've recently read into Quantum Computing and am very interested in the possibilities of applying theoretical physics to computation. However I find it difficult to fathom.. I understand the a stored Qubit experienced superposition and can therefore take upon two states at once until measured...

I asked myself ""Assume I wanted to try a simple operation such as addition""

Classically, when adding two sets of 4 bits, i.e. 0110 (6) and 1001 (9) we'd get the result 1111 (15)

What I'm having problems imagining is the addition of four qubits to four qubits. This operation would return every possible number from 0 to 30 -&gt; with the numbers from 1 to 29 repeated twice - as this is every possible value obtained from the addition of the integers from 0 to 15 to another set of integers from 0 to 15.
How would one get a meaningful answer from this?
Perhaps it's not meant for addition =&gt; perhaps it's applications are in things such as brute-force attacks? Or am I thinking about it wrong?

I apologise for asking such a newbie question - hopefully I don't get downvoted too hard. I'm just incredibly curious :)",QuantumComputing,Ewildawe,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/3vy3bs/quantum_computing_newbie_asking_a_question/,4

I don't believe in superposition. Here's why:,1448957156,"The most popular experiment used as evidence supporting superposition is the Double-Slit experiment conducted with electrons. 

However, looking at how the experiment is conducted, a simpler explanation becomes apparent:
&gt;These electrons were accelerated to 50,000 V, and therefore the speed is about 40 % of the speed of the light, i. e., it is 120,000 km/second. These electrons can go around the earth three times in a second. So, they pass through a one-meter-long electron microscope in 1/100,000,000 of a second.
http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/highlight/quantum/

40% the speed of light; the electrons in the experiment are traveling at relativistic speeds - fast enough for an electron to interact with its own electromagnetic field. As the electron approaches the slit, it's negative electromagnetic field (which travels as a wave) passes through both slits, with diffraction produced resulting in an interference pattern. As the electron passes through the slit, it interacts with its negative electromagnetic field which passed through the other slit. 

Thus, the locations where the electrons end up on the detector forms a pattern resembling the diffraction of a wave passing through two slits.

The idea of 'cat' superposition being harnessed as a qubit then wouldn't work; transistors being on, off, and on/off at the same time working in tandum with other on off &amp; on/off transistors isn't possible.
What I believe the future of quantum computing will actually entail is the manipulation of the analog frequency and other intrinsic properties of various particles for the purpose of transferring information.

Am I going crazy?,1433825757,"Damn, this is going to be a novel.

So, I have little to no education in this area, but I want to share something that happened. The regular answer is that I either mis-observed something, or the security panel in my home is damaged. Also, I have not been able to reproduce what occurred. But a quick synopsis of my question would be: can the intent of the user on a graphical user interface utilizing a touchscreen affect the outcome of a particular output?

Here's the story. My house has a system that not only integrates security, but also lighting and thermostat. 

My question concerns only the lighting. There are only two areas controlled by the system, the two living room lamps and the front room lamp. Basically, there is a circle that slides to control the amount of ambient light in the room, let's say 0-5.  0 on the left being off, and 5 on the right being on full, except without the numbers. Google image ""vivent light control panel"", and the first image returned will show you what it kinda look likes. It's not the exact pic, but if you look at the cylinders with the unlocked symbol on the left side, you get an idea of what the slide control looks like. There are no numbers, just a circle that can move left and right when one slides a finger across the touchscreen gui.

So instead of being small and next to each other in a row like the lock/unlock cylinders in the pic, they are longer and in a column, to accommodate for the adjustment the ambient light in a room, or just turn things off when the lights can't do ambient mood lighting.

Also, only the front lamp can do ambient lighting in degrees, and the living room lamps, they are always on full except for when the circle is dragged all the way to the left of the cylinder in the off position because again, they're just regular old lamps.

Also, when I turn off the lights by sliding the circle to the left, the gui reacts faster than the lights, and I can slide both off before the lights will turn off.  I presume this is because the lights are plugged into remote vivent sockets which in turn are plugged into the electrical sockets, and it takes time for the signal to transfer, like wireless printing.

Alright, so this is what happened, and the source of my question. I'm going to bed one night, about to turn off the lights and arm the system. Not really paying attention, I'm thinking to myself, and intend to, turn off the living room lights first, and then the front lamp off second. It all happened very quickly, but I know for a fact the following happened: I wasn't paying attention to the switch I was hitting, but not only did I think and intend for the living room lights to go off first, they did. As I am finishing swiping the other cylinder to the far left position, I realized that I did not swipe the cylinder that controls the living room lamps first, but the front lamp first. Also, at this point, instead of slowing going from light to dim to black like it regularly does, the front ambient light went immediately from on to off. I stood and stared at the panel for 10 seconds dumbstruck because I realized what had happened after I had slid both cylinders left/off and after the living room lights had gone off, but before the front lamp immediately turned from on to off without dimming first (dat wireless delay). 

My theory as to why I can't reproduce it I guess kinda revolves around the measuring of a partical like in the double slit experiment. Every time I consciously look at it, I know which is which as I am mentally measuring it.

Like I said, I could be going crazy, or simply I just remembered incorrectly, or the panel could be acting up (though I doubt it because to date this is the only instance of it ever ""malfunctioning"" so to speak). But back to my question above: can the intent, and only the intent, of an user operating a touchscreen, wireless gui potentially alter the output of a function when the said output is supposed to be fixed? And can it somehow be tested? I have an idea for testing, but my roommate would think I'm crazy and it would require knowledge of programming that I dont have.


Tl;dr: lights turned off by opposite switches when I incorrectly thought said opposite switches controlled the lights, when in actuality they didn't.

P.S. The front lamp went from on to off just after I realized what had happened. ",QuantumComputing,[deleted],/r/QuantumComputing/comments/394h4r/am_i_going_crazy/,11

"Research paper, undergrad project",1432564846,"Hello to everyone here, I only found this sub a few weeks ago while browsing Reddit but i've been surprised about the amount of material posted on here i didn't think Reddit would have suck a large QC scene.

I have an undergrad research project ""Discuss the advantages and physics of a quantum computer"". My supervisor wants me to cover the basics of quantum computing and compare it to classical computing, this bit is fairly simple and i have a plan laid out for this.
The part i'm struggling with , while staying within my word limit and my time scale (i have a few days to finish this project as i have exams for the next two weeks), is giving an overview of the types of quantum computers and the physics of each, i originally picked this project because i've been really interested in D-Wave and Josephson junctions, (i've followed their announcements since 2011/12).
As a result i've done casual reading about QC for a while  but finding reliable sources that i can reference is hard and overly time consuming, so far i have been using: web of science, research gate and just general non reference-able materials from the internet. The problem is the largest portion of marks for the project are from finding similar papers on the area of research, with mine being so large and varied and with QC being such a new area of research i'm struggling to find enough papers to use.
If anyone has any suggestion on where i could find papers or any that would be useful it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I am aware that interference with a quantum computer causes decoherence, however I was wondering whilst watching a bunch of videos explaining how quantum computers work, what if we could fix the issue of decoherence?

I realize that you have to be able to know the coherence in order to fix it and be 100% sure you fixed it. However is there a possible way in which was could know such a thing to prevent decoherence?

I was just thinking about the development of computers and moore's law, how silicon will eventually no longer be needed for computers. I am aware that in the near future companies are ready to develop 3 dimensional hardware, as well as parallel processing. 

If I'm not mistaken, 3 dimensional hardware is already being developed by the likes of IBM. Like the Blue Brain project as an example?

Feedback on my toy quantum circuit simulator?,1418176122,"Recently I've been working on a toy quantum circuit simulator, and I wanted some feedback and suggestions.

[**The simulator is here on jsfiddle**](http://jsfiddle.net/c4f5z73v/2/).

Instructions:

- Drag gates onto the wires.
- The center-right shows the probability of each individual wire being ON if measured at the end.
- The bottom-right shows the final state's amplitudes, layed out in a grid to be a bit more compact.
- Hover over a column to see its net operation, and the intermediate state.
- Combine the 'peek' gate with the control/anti-control gates to see conditional probabilities.
- Use the evolving/time-varying gates like X(t) to animate how a changing operation affects the output.

Some limitations you can complain about:

- Doesn't work on mobile (the touch events are wired up wrong, and there's hover hints)
- The only way to measure a wire is to controlled-not it into an unused wire (and then not operate on that second wire).
- Can't define custom gates
- Can't put two controlled operations in the same column, unless they have the same controls
- Can't save/load circuits
- Can't add qubits
- Can't scroll to the right; effectively limiting the size of the circuit

"Our ""colour-blind"" perception of time: How to rebuild memory into Qu-bits",1416812074,"One of the leading controversies or inherent paradoxes of quantum mechanics is that multiple possibilities exist. In layman's terms, we have a choice of either tea or biscuits for lunch, and we chose one in real time, our course of action has one path, not all paths simultaneously. In other words, our perception of time is linear. 

However, what if time is non-linear? As a colour-blind person, one cannot see reds and browns, nor distinguish between reds and greens. What if our perception of time is that of a colour-blind person? We cannot see the multiple layers of time because our sight is linear. 

In fact, let's say all possibilities exist on a non-linear trajectory, crisscrossing at different planes of the space-time continuum, and all actions and events have that ""spooky"" connection that Einstein imagined. 

If so, then we can predict the future- because the future isn't really the future- it is on a parallel plane of non-linear time in which we cannot discern yet- although it is there and exists simultaneously. 

So my question is: How would you rebuild memory in Qu-bits? So far lots of organisations are attempting to build the first commercial Quantum Computer- D-WAVE, Google, BrainWave, et al not including the NSA. If we were to be able to utilise a complex version of the most available quantum computer- namely our ""brains"" which also process information via quantum mechanics- how would we re-wire a commercial version by mimicking the way our brains work in conjunction to how to translate the Qu-bits into electrodes, perception, memory, and  other tools by integration with classical binary computers that have a linear perception of events? 

If you were to begin to build it, how would you begin?

Can someone explain the relationship between quantum annealing and ray tracing to a layman?,1416183870,"To be honest, I only have a surface knowledge of quantum computing and never went beyond Physics 2 in college, but I'm pretty competent in ray tracing simply because I work primarily with 3d modelling and rendering, it's just the math that I get lost at. But can someone explain to me how a quantum computer can take advantage of ray tracing? My understanding is that annealing calculates the shortest travel time a ray cast has to take to reach an object and how it bends and reflects, correct? Does this mean that 20-30 years from now we can rely on quantum computers to overtake super computers when computing 3d movies and rendering video games? Or are there still limitations to what a quantum computer can and can't calculate?

Real life quantum decoherence OnEvent handlers,1416150358,"Imagine real life, quantum OnEvent handlers. If we were to entangle particles dealing with real world superpositions (I.e. who will win the game, or the vote), and had one end of the entangled system acting as a quantum computer OnEvent listener, so that when decoherence happens (a certain team wins, etc) it triggers whatever you have set up. E.g. terrorists could blackmail and have it triggered to a bomb if a certain candidate wins the election, or we could use it for other (good!) automation / contingencies.

I understand this is radically different than the annealing algorithms etc. of most quantum computers, and also different than quantum networking, as it's dealing with real world entanglement instead of limited sets of information being passed to it. But I think it may be an interesting and feasible application. 

I took an intro to quantum computing course but the vector mathematics were a bit too much for me, but I understand the principles. Let's brainstorm this, whether a system like this is feasible, what would be involved, etc.

Which college courses to take to understand hardware of quantum computing?,1413581752,"Hi I am an undergrad student in an Electrical engineering program and going for my masters and undergrad degree at the same time (special program i am in). I an very interested on the hardware side of quantum computing as to have a future career in this field (eventually will go for a PhD). I was wondering what classes specifically I should be taking to better support this goal. At the moment my masters concentration is in microelectronic devices and systems which mainly focuses on solid state devices/solid state physics and VLSI design along with some core courses which include Linear systems theory (mostly signal processing), probability and stochastic processes and analytical methods for EEs (this includes a lot of linear algebra, Cauchy-Binet and Laplace determinant theorems, system of linear equations; linear transformations, basis and rank; Gaussian elimination; LU and congruent transformations; Gramm-Schmidt; eigenvalues, eigenvectors and similarity transformations; canonical forms; functions of matrices; singular value decomposition; generalized inverses; norm of a matrix; polynomial matrices; matrix differential equations; state space; controllability and observability)

Due to completing a lot of my prereq college courses in high school it has leaked over to me being able to have a lot of electives in my grad program since I was able to finish core courses for my grad program in my undergrad program. Some of these electives will be going to quantum mechanics courses obviously. My questions are do I have the math background after the above courses and the generic core engineering math curriculum (multivariable calc/differential equations calculus etc.) to understand the physics/engineering in the field i am interested in and if not what math courses should i be looking for to fix that, general courses i should take and should I focus more on computer architecture classes or moreso physics classes.

Why are the exponentially small phase gates used in the QFT practical?,1412696698,"The [quantum fourier transform circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform#mediaviewer/File:Quantum_Fourier_transform_on_n_qubits.svg) shown on the Wikipedia QFT article uses a τ/2^n phase gate, where n is the number of qubits. All QFT circuits I've seen do this.

How can this sort of exponentially small change be implemented/represented? It seems like you'd have to make your implementation of qubits twice as noise-resistant in order increase the number of qubits you can QFT by one, which is clearly not tractable.

In fact, a lot of quantum computations rely on very small changes to the amplitudes, and so it seems like even tiny perturbations from noise would place strict limits on how much you could scale up the machine.

My guess is that there's a known way to ""spread"" the precision around, so you can emulate one double-precise logical qubit with multiple physical qubits. Is that right?

Does processing for a quantum computer take place in different universes?,1403657577,"Apologies in advance if my question seems misinformed. I am a software developer, and neither quantum mechanics nor physics are my specialties.

From http://physics.about.com/od/quantumphysics/f/quantumcomp.htm:

&gt; *The exact physical mechanism at work within the quantum computer is somewhat theoretically complex and intuitively disturbing. Generally, it is explained in terms of the multi-world interpretation of quantum physics, wherein the computer performs calculations not only in our universe but also in other universes simultaneously, while the various qubits are in a state of quantum decoherence.*

And from http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/writing/PCW/q2.htm:

&gt; *The amazing power of the quantum computer stems from the fact that if you have a collection of qubits – a register – in which each qubit is in an indeterminate state, then the register effectively represents all possible numbers at once. If you then perform a single computation on the register, the computation works on every possible number, simultaneously. David Deutsch explains the process using the idea of parallel universes – although we see only the single register in our universe, it actually exists in many other universes too, one for each of its possible states. By operating on the register in our universe, we kick off computations in all the other unseen universes, and then magically retrieve the answer.*

Assuming the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, does this mean that a quantum computer is capable of considering all possible solutions to a problem simultaneously because it delegates the consideration of (calculations for) each possible solution to a different universe?",QuantumComputing,chaddjohnson,/r/QuantumComputing/comments/290lwr/does_processing_for_a_quantum_computer_take_place/,6

I've coded a quantum logic simulator based on this idea, and it works exactly as expected, so I'm taking that to mean my understanding is correct.

My confusion arises when we start talking about oracle functions, as in Grover's algorithm. 
In Grover's algorithm, the oracle function is defined as:

One Redditors guide to learning Quantum Computing,1396822643,"**Me**

First a bit about who I am, and where I am coming from. I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science. My education (Bachelor's and Master's) is in computer science. I have always been interested in Physics (from Astronomy to Quantum Mechanics (QM)) but I have never taken a class in Physics. Even my math background is limited, only taking a handful of basic math courses throughout my education. 

Yet, my PhD is in Quantum Computing (QC). This is a bit of a dilemma because I have never been taught many (all?) of the important foundational principles behind QC.  And, for various reasons, I am responsible for teaching QC to myself -- and this is how I am doing it. I hope that anyone looking to learn QC will find this helpful.

**A starting place** 

The most challenging part. With so much to learn, where do you start? On top of that, how can you start with the basics without losing motivation? I recommend starting by learning about the big picture, for this:

[The age of entanglement: When quantum physics was reborn; Louisa Gilder](http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Entanglement-Quantum-Physics/dp/1400095263/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396750675&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=age+of+entanglement+when+quantum+physics+was+reborn).

*	A great book to understand how the quantum world started, who started it, why it was necessary (important!), and how it has and is developing. Audiobook available.

*	Just an awesome video
*	[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMdHDHEuOUE)
 

**The goal** 

Ok, now that you are really interested in learning about QC, where do we actually start? Well, some might disagree with me, but start reading scientific papers. 

[ArXiv: Quantum Physics](http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new)

*	ArXiv is the standard location for most quantum computing papers. They are not peer reviewed, but are up immediately (better than the usual 1 year wait for publishing!!). Also free to public, no university proxy needed. [http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new](http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new)

[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.ca/) 

* Think of a topic &amp; Google it. Or search general QC and pick out things you find interesting. [http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Quantum+computing](http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Quantum+computing)

This will be hard -- you will not understand everything in any paper (that’s ok, you’re not suppose to!), but it will give several things. 

1.	A goal to work towards (to understand these papers, and maybe write one)
2.	What the current research in the field is 
3.	Many different ways of explaining the basics (via introductions)
4.	An idea of what you need to learn. 

Read abstracts, introductions, and the related work sections of as many papers you can, this will provide many different ways of explaining the same things. Follow citations to find which other papers are important. Here is a paper to start with (D-Wave device focused):

* A Near-Term Quantum Computing Approach… [http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2821](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2821) 


**Prerequisites**

QM and thus QC are based in linear algebra. You will need to have a VERY strong understanding of linear algebra to make any headway in QC – all QC textbooks assume you know basic linear algebra; they then build upon that to teach you the required advanced topics. I needed to relearn linear algebra to do this: 

[Khan’s Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

*	Expect 25+ hours of video lectures; surprisingly, all are important. This will give you the required foundations of linear algebra.
*	[https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra ) 

**Learning QC** 

Finally we can get to learning about QC. For textbooks I suggest the following:

[Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists; Yanofsky &amp; Mannucci](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396752221&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=quantum+computing+for+computer+scientists)

* This took my background in CS into account and tailored the material accordingly. A great starting book. This also has many practice problems, with their solutions! Also, has a great first section on complex numbers, which I did not know, but is important.

[An introduction to Quantum Computing; Kaye et al.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Computing-Phillip-Kaye/dp/019857049X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396753325&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=an+introduction+to+quantum+computing)

* I found the previous book easier to work through, but this provides another perspective to learn from. Also has some different material.

[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information; Nielsen &amp; Chuang](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-Anniversary-Edition/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396753160&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=2.+Quantum+Computation+and+Quantum+Information)

* Generally regarded as the ‘QC Bible’, difficult to read, but an indispensable reference.

How can we manipulate qubits without destroying the superposition?,1395784368,"Hello everyone,

I'm interested in Quantum Physics, and a few weeks ago I've started gathering informations about quantum computing. I've found it extremely interesting, but unfortunately also very hard to grasp.  I'm confused especially with the process of writing and reading information on qubits in the form of a single particles such as electrons.

I've always thought that the superposition exists only when there is no decoherence=no interactions=no measurements, however when we try to prepare the electron for computation we have to manipulate with its spin by applying magnetic field, microwave etc. 

As far as I know the superposition comes from the Schrodingers equation which represents a quantum probability wave, and the only thing we can do with it, is to collapse by observing, or if you prefer interact with it. I've really never thought there is a way to manpulate with the superposition, so I'm extremely confused right now.

I know there are some superconducting materials which can allow in some conditions (low temperature) to settle the particles down, and thus reveal and retain the qantum behaviour, but how can we manipulate with the superposition without destroying it?
 

 I'd like to ask about something more. I know that apart from the classical approach there are also other methods such as quantum annealing. So what is the difference between the quantum anealing and the cassical approach? 

In clasical approach probably it is necesary to have a fully entangled system in the opposite of quantm annealing, but I'm not completely sure.

Does the quantum annealing approach require gates?

Learning quantum programming,1394406375,"I think we should have a thread of resources for and advice on learning quantum programming. Two useful preliminaries are probably knowing quantum circuits (http://www.quantiki.org/wiki/List_of_QC_simulators you can find a list of simulators to play around with here) and understanding quantum lambda calculi (which I guess can be considered a very low level quantum programming language here are introductions two different calculi http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/qlambdabook.pdf and http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307150). 

  If you want a resource on how programming is  done on an actual quantum computer D-wave had a series of developer tutorials which they've removed but are now available here https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020535/http://www.dwavesys.com/en/dev-tutorials.html. 
Quantasoft  also offers instruction to anyone who requests it through this form http://quantasoft.webs.com/learn-quantum-in.

I've sometimes thought about learning quantum programming before learning classical programming to be free of biases most people programming in a classical language would have. But there are obvious problems with doing that, such as you won't be able to practice what you learn or use it for a while and you could in fact learn things wrong and have trouble unlearning them because it can be hard to predict outcomes of programs especially ones you have no way of emulating. Still I think learning Quipper language (http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/doc/index.html) which is really a haskell library concurrently  with haskell could be a good idea for anyone who doesn't too used to classical programming. Any resources you'd recommend ?

Can using a hash of a public key protect sha256 encryption from being broken by a quantum computer?,1391340887,"Taken from http://sneakpeek.avatar.ai/technology.html in the section titled: Object permissions and secure Object modifying

PHASH is sha256 hash computed from the public key counterpart to the private key in PSEC. Because Shor's algorithm will provide quantum computers a very, very fast way to bruteforce private keys from public keys, we want to avoid exposing any keys unless absolutely necessary. Instead of storing the public key in the chunk's permission scope, we only store a hash of it. This way the public key is only exposed if the Object needs to be updated. Quantum computing doesn't provide any meaningful threat to cryptographic hash functions.

/user/ex-mo-fo-sho wrote this up about qc. Is the experiment about quantum particles accurate?,1388777445,"This is best explanation I've heard: (explained to me like a 5-year-old). Take this with a grain of salt, as I am likely to get some of the details technically wrong.

Basic Quantum Idea

Imagine you have a particle gun. You shoot it at a sensor that detects when it is hit with the particle. Call this sensor A. You fire the gun, A lights up, as expected.

Now, you introduce a second sensor, B. This is positioned in such a way that if you put a mirror in the path of the gun and sensor A at a 45 degree angle, the particle will bounce off the mirror, and hit sensor B.

You add the mirror, and sure enough, every time you fire the gun, sensor B lights up.

Now, replace the mirror with a mirror that has a bunch of holes poked in it. Such that there is now a 50/50 change that when the gun fires, the particle will either pass through one of the holes, and hit A, or reflect off the mirror and hit B. You fire up the gun a bunch, and sure enough, you get a 50/50 pattern of A's and B's: ABBABABBABABBBAABABBAA

Now, behind the mirror, and in front of A, you place a wall that would block any particle. So, when a particle passes through a hole in the mirror, it would then hit the wall, and never reach A. You would expect to see a 50/50 pattern like this: B--B-B--B-B-B--BB-B, because the wall is blocking anything from ever getting to A. But with quantum physics, this isn't the case. It is almost as if the particle is intelligent.

""Since I can never reach A, I'll go to B every time."" says the particle. So, the pattern that emerges is: BBBBBBBBBB.

This can be rephrased as such: Since B is the only possible outcome in our reality, the quantum particle will manifest that way, every time. Now, let's apply this idea to quantum computing:
Let's build a quantum computer

You setup your quantum processor with qubits and the like. You want to crack an asymmetrical cipher. So, you setup parameters such that you have the cyphertext, and you know that the plaintext is probably a message readable by a human. You enter these parameters into your quantum compy, and boom! In a single clock cycle, you have the key. How? Because the qubits will only manifest themselves in a way that is possible in our reality, which in this case is the correct key to unencrypt the message.

Is all crypto broken?

Not at all. Encryption based on public/private keys, shared secrets, etc., is all easily broken with quantum computing. However, non-deterministic algorithms (such as using a true one-time random pad of numbers) is not broken. This goes back to the quantum idea: If it is impossible to determine a single possibility (non deterministic), then anything could be the outcome. While, conversely, if only a single outcome is possible (there is only one passcode that will successfully unencrypt the data), then quantum computing will manifest that single possibility.

"I'm new to the idea of quantum computing, is my idea of it correct?",1388524462,"After listening to multiple people explain what quantum computing is, it kind  of makes it sound as if it is taking the desired output and working out what input you would need to get that value when calculated.

So if I take the inverse of factoring (multiplying numbers together), I could basically program a quantum computer to 'multiply numbers together' and give it a desired output (lets say 12 for example or binary 1100) and it could try multipling 10 numbers together with 4 qubits each so

0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 

but these are apparently not just 1 or 0, but both so (b = both)

bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb

and if you were to multiply all of them together it would produce multiple results in parallel and you would just have to pick out the result that was equal to the desired answer. (I am a little fuzzy on how this would work)

So you would end up calculating a large number of multiplications in parallel where one or more of the answers would be 12, from that you then somehow get the 

tl;dr it can calculate a lot of number in parallel but the initial numbers its starts with are kind of random and unpredictable.
