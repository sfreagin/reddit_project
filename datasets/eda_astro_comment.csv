Kaluza-Klein theory imagined a 5D spacetime with one of the spatial dimensions compactified, or curled up, to a microscopic scale such that it would not be observable in low energy scenarios. 

My thought was what would happen at extremely high energy densities - might the compactified dimension become macroscopic? Could the singularity be avoided by projection into the bulk?

29,"It is called Gravitational Lensing and Einstein first described the basics (which he actually got totally wrong the first time he published it). It is more like lensing from refraction than any specific bending of space-time. It is much more like going around a sphere with a more dense medium around it which refracts the light ray path. These gravitational lenses are being used to observe galaxies 'behind' them, from Earth observation point, and the refracted images of them are seen around the 'black hole'. There are some where the galaxy beyond them is refracted multiple times around it, all time-shifted from each other.

Parsing the Science of Interstellar with Physicist Kip Thorne

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Well, correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems to me that not all of the science is treated equally in the film, **with the science behind its visual components being favored.** Take Gargantua, the supermassive black hole the astronauts visit in the film. It’s a thing of beauty, not only aesthetically but also quantitatively, because as you’ve shown in the book, it looks like the real thing. That happened through a painstaking back-and-forth process between you and the filmmakers. But in your book you also mention that Christopher Nolan came to you with a “non-negotiable” and rather far-fetched idea for the astronauts to visit a planet orbiting Gargantua where relativistic effects make an hour there equate to seven years back on Earth.

[https://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/)

&gt;That's not the only headache inducing bit of physics that the film's special effects team had to grapple with. Nolan's story relied on time dilation: time passing at different rates for different characters. To make this scientifically plausible, Thorne told him, he'd need a massive black hole—in the movie it's called Gargantua—spinning at nearly the speed of light. As a filmmaker, Nolan had no idea how to make something like that look realistic. But he had an idea how to make it happen. ***“Chris called me and said he wanted to send a guy over to my house to talk to me about the visual effects,” Thorne says. “I said, ‘Sure, send him over.’” It wasn't long before Paul Franklin showed up on Thorne's doorstep.***

43,"Hi there, it is indeed correct to state that what essentially keeps starts together is the constant interplay between the gravitational pressure that pushes inwards and the radiation pressure gradient that pushes outwards; this is a really important concept in undergraduate astronomy and is an application of hydrostatic equilibrium. 

Realistically, things can be considered in a more complicated but similar way by looking into general relativity, but the use of hydrostatic equilibrium is definitely a good starting point.

I'd keep in mind that hydrostatic equilibrium is maintained only approximately, at all times. Stars are huge objects and variations in energy generation and gravitational push can cause subtle changes in the size of all stars, even the most stable of main sequence stars.

There are more exaggerated examples of the breakdown of hydrostatic equilibrium in some star types: the kappa mechanism of Cepheid variable stars is a classic undergraduate example of such.

If you are aiming to discuss stellar remnants then you are in luck as there is a plethora of information on the topic; you could talk about how different stellar masses give different remnants and possibly even discuss more mathematical things such as the Chadrasekhar limit and the TOV limit. 

Of course, keep in kind that stellar remnants do not utilise hydrostatic equilibrium but have their own individual degeneracy pressures.


If you have any questions please feel free to message me.",1617121053,astrophysics,SirMerky,Astrophysics,Comment,232
44,"Yeah, for fusing stars, thermal pressure balancing gravity is a pretty common way to describe its equilibrium. For the remnants though, things are different. They aren’t fusing, so they can’t get a balancing pressure from that. White dwarfs and neutrons stars counteract gravity by using degeneracy pressure, which is a quantum phenomenon resulting from the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Black holes are black holes because there’s nothing that is sufficient to balance their gravitational contraction.",1617120728,astrophysics,greenwizardneedsfood,Astrophysics,Comment,74

If that is not the case, you won’t see that light. It does imply that you will stop seeing the galaxies that are far away from you, since eventually the distance is going to be so large that it will increase faster than what light can cover in a given time.

Check out what the edge of the observable universe means. It’s a horizon boundary so far away, that any light that is emitted beyond it can never reach us, at the current rate of expansion.",1617078822,astrophysics,MrMakeItAllUp,Astrophysics,Comment,144

76,"Mars is pretty much in thermal equilibrium now, so getting it back to being molten enough in the core to produce a magnetic field would essentially re-melt the whole planet. And the issue with that, again, is the problem that tidal forces tend to try to rip things apart before they do any heating. So you'd have to work extremely hard to not end up with Mars getting ripped apart, making this process just as over-conplicated and difficult. And all of that assumes you could get enough material - the entire asteroid belt's mass put together would make something only a small fraction of the Moon's mass, meaning it would be tiny, and keeping it separate would be even worse, since tidal forces scale with mass so having a bunch of asteroids in orbit would just make it hard to land, not warm up the planet. 

Water would not necessarily cool the surface, and warming it would cause the near-surface ice to melt, which would thicken the atmosphere with water vapor which is a very strong greenhouse gas so it would help warm up the planet. The issue is, thickening the atmosphere does you no good if the new atmosphere is lost over time.We need to find a way to protect the atmosphere, but all the ways of doing that have their own major issues",1616992084,astrophysics,IrisCelestialis,Astrophysics,Comment,225

Infrared vision enabled Spitzer's cameras to see past the clouds of interstellar dust that block visible light between Earth and the center of the galaxy 26,000 light-years away. In the image, cooler old stars appear in blue at the edges, while massive young stars burn a hot red hue.

103,"If we had learned how to accelerate light. I'd imagine that the moment it exited whatever we're using to accelerate that light it'd just resume to c given the way that light behaves. So unfortunately some of the more extravagant ideas of what could be possible if we accelerate light won't come to fruition.

If we could accelerate light, I'd imagine very large machines would be made to accelerate light. As we only see things through light, if light's speed increases to a speed faster than other things in this universe that already travel ftl (Whatever they may be), that might lead to us physically being able to see things that we've never been able to see before (within the constraints of the machine of course). However whether it'd lead to understanding of other things such as quantum entanglement is difficult to say because we don't have the technology to observe things that travel at such speeds. The few things we have observed that travel ftl have only been observed because we slowed down the speed of light to observe them or because we witnessed the radiation they emitted and so on. So if there is a way to make use of accelerating light, I'm not sure what it is. It'd still be something groundbreaking though.

This is all just in my head I should add. I don't know for sure. I'm more of an enthusiast rather than someone actually knowledgeable and there's always a possibility that I'm completely wrong.

133,"&gt;Inside spacetime. Space itself expanding could be faster.

This is based on a misunderstanding. The expansion of the universe does not have a speed (units of distance / time), it has a rate (units 1 / time). Expansion can't be assigned a speed. Spactime does not have a speed. 

At best the ""expansion"" ""faster than light"" stuff is a mangled version of the fact that velocities between distant objects aren't meaningful and they aren't local velocities (which are always &lt; c), described here

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/400457/what-does-general-relativity-say-about-the-relative-velocities-of-objects-that-a

And multiplying the rate of expansion gives you a number with units of velocity but it is not the local velocity of two things, not a very meaningful figure and can be larger than c (and even when it is it does not mean that we can't observe things where this figure exceeds c, we can and do).

&gt;If time stops at the speed of light is an ongoing question, one connected to if the Photon (light) has mass. ""photon decay"".

This is wrong as well (and logically incoherent actually because it mixes two things that are seperate).

1 It's not correct ""time stops"" for a light speed object.  A fact of relativity is that there are no rest frames for lightspeed objects (whatever type of particle they are, photons or other).

2 Whether photons are massive or not is IRRELEVANT for that. Even if they had mass, that doesn't change 1, lightspeed particles don't have a rest frame. If photons weren't massless then nothing changes about this.

3 There is no basis to claim photons have mass anyway.

4 It's not ""an ongoing question"".

A thought experiment that goes ""WHAT is going to happen,  IF I design an experiment this way"" can be answered using the current physics, then worked on to resolve inconsistencies to figure out what is missing and invent it. Then, maybe even, actually run that experiment.

Newton's theory of gravity was based on proposing earth's gravitation field that pulls an apple, might also be the one pulling the moon, and so with other planets and moons. He then compared that theory with the Kepler's laws of motion, and computed the inverse square law of gravity.

So as far as we're aware, light can be slower than c and travel at different speeds, however it cannot be faster than c unless we discover a way or an example of it being accelerated, which is not possible with our current understanding of physics.",1616905736,astrophysics,Alpha-Charlie-Romeo,Astrophysics,Comment,113
144,"&gt;nothing is faster than light

Inside spacetime. Space itself expanding could be faster.

You first must understand that Relativity does state there is no space and no time, but spacetime. Both are connected. That means that anyone inside our Universe is affected by time dilation - every observer. Relativity now states that everything has its own ""clock"" - but it also states that light always travels at the same speed no matter where measured (in vacuum). So, yes both beams would go at the speed of light. The distance and the state of the observer matter.

If time stops at the speed of light is an [ongoing question, one connected to if the Photon (light) has mass](https://physicsworld.com/a/what-is-the-lifetime-of-a-photon/). ""photon decay"".

I can't give you a why, how or definitive answer, but it sounds like you want to read about the thought experiment called [Tachyonic antitelephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone) :

&gt;Numerical example with two-way communication  
&gt;  
&gt;As an example, imagine that Alice and Bob are aboard spaceships moving inertially with a relative speed of 0.8c. At some point they pass right next to each other, and Alice defines the position and time of their passing to be at position x = 0, time t = 0 in her frame, while Bob defines it to be at position x′ = 0 and time t′ = 0 in his frame (note that this is different from the convention used in the previous section, where the origin of the coordinates was the event of Bob receiving a tachyon signal from Alice). In Alice's frame she remains at rest at position x = 0, while Bob is moving in the positive x direction at 0.8c; in Bob's frame he remains at rest at position x′ = 0, and Alice is moving in the negative x′ direction at 0.8c.

Need i remind you, physics breaks at the singularity and yet it is real and does break physics as we know it, we need quantum mechanics for that, besides if we are gonna use only what we know we will never learn new things, without curiosity questioning and constant work where would we be as species? I believe i have mentioned that its a thought experiment, there are many thought experiments that are just science fiction or magic as you put it, because the laws of physics do not allow it, did not stop those great minds from putting those questions. where would we be if Newton just gave up on gravity because someone told him that sounds stupid?
I was simply thinking if we take the facts with the numbers we have and change 1 variable and check the results and keep doing that, maybe we will reach to a conclusion that helps us better understand the universe we are in. It is really good to be scientific, i consider myself a man of science, i live my life this way, but that doesn't stop me from questioning everything and yes even imagining stuff to help me better understand other things, its not like i treat it as a fact in my day to day life or in a lab trying to prove it. It is good that you know what you're talking about, believe me im always happy to see people know this stuff rather than just saying 'ohh i dont know it must be god' i believe you will be a great teacher or someone who can just repeat facts, but if you want to be remembered as one of the great minds or improving your train of thought maybe have a bit more open mind about such things, and keep in mind.
Clearly you missed the point, the fact that we have the name  tachyons means someone thought along this line, and i believe i also mentioned that i had poor choice of worlds regarding the movement doesn't make the idea of faster than light not valid, again! Im not saying it's a fact and such particles exist for sure! All im saying if you're gonna keep treating everything as in not real even in your thoughts you wont manage to do anything useful in life specially in this subject aside from giving said information to others just the way you learned it.

146,"I did some thinking about this and the only reason why it seems so absurd that it is measured the same is that you see only two cases here: normal everyday life, and then this thought experiment.
In reality it’s a gradient that slowly changes from one to the other. The measured speed in a frame at rest relative to a moving frame will always be at most different by the speed of the moving frame. As speeds approach that of the speed of light, there is a factor that shifts the measured speed difference to be lower and lower. Until either the speed of the frame, or the object moving in the moving frame reach the speed of light- when this happens the measured speed of the object is the same regardless of speed of moving frame.

One way to see this is with the equation 

U = (V + U’) / (1 + V*U’/c^2 )

This is trivially derived with Lorentz transforms and U is the measured speed of an object from a stationary frame, while U’ is the measured speed of the same object in a frame moving at speed V.
Clearly U’-U is maximized when U’ is minimized assuming constant V and U’&gt;= 0.",1616895875,astrophysics,CrackBabyCSGO,Astrophysics,Comment,208

Relative to what? There is no absolute motion.

For you, one second always takes one second.

If you know it's not possible, why do you try doing it?

&gt; and it's not like we know everything there to know about the universe

That doesn't mean we would know nothing. Relativity has been tested thousands of times, often with incredible precision. It works really, really well.

&gt; But what if, there is a speed faster than light but we simply can't absorb it?

That would not be light then. And if it doesn't interact with anything it's pointless to speculate about it. If it does interact with something then you can send messages to your own past, which comes with all sorts of paradoxes.

Known physics breaks here. Anything with mass cannot travel at that speed. Whatever experiment you design under this assumption is science fiction only. And hence, you can get any result you want without worrying about if it’s scientifically possible or not.

&gt; We know a lot of strange things we can’t explain.

Does not mean we abandon the laws and evidence we can explain.

&gt; photons have infinite energy.

No. Each photon has a clearly defined finite energy (h* v). Photons travel the fastest not because of energy, but because of their zero mass. Anything with zero mass must travel at light speed. That’s the rule. It could be a photon, or a gluon, or even graviton. We know light waves and gravitational waves both travel at speed of light.

&gt; What if we are missing something.

We are missing a lot of knowledge. Does not mean that every claim is true. We cannot say anything can happen. We can only say that under our current understanding, this can happen and this cannot. A “what if” scenario that does not rely on current physics is completely the same as every fictional story. What if magic exists?

We know of a lot of strange things that we can't explain, where most of them could be explained if the means of traveling faster than light is possible, such as quantum entanglement. Lets assume that you can travel at the speed of light and your speed of thought is also at the speed of light, once you're traveling at said speed you'll absorb humanity on earth going super fast because time effect you less thus makes you traveling through time to the future to us you and all photons travels at the same speed, but what if from your perspective once you hit the speed of light you can see particles that actually move faster than you, you think it's impossible, but what if the only way to absorb these particles or some photons or whatever they are is to be moving at the speed of light. You both will reach Jupiter (lets say) where humanity absorbed you reaching at the same time but to you this particular particle reached before you do.

I know! Photons have infinite energy with zero Mass thus giving them the best potential to travel the fastest. But what if we're missing something? Its not like we know everything about the universe. Maybe it's nkt photons but i did not mentioned tachyons because that is just hypocritical particle. But what if photons can have the same property?

229,"My university only has a generic Physics major but I did virtually all of the Astro-related courses.

1) Very unlikely to get a first-author paper published in your first year. If you're lucky and get a project with a big group, you might be able to get yourself tacked on as a co-author to a paper.

2) The courses I did had no orbital maneuver planning etc. That is done by the aerospace engineers. The closest I got was calculating some particle orbits my General Relativity courses.

3) My research isn't in astrophysics, although I have friends who are astrophysicists. I'd say it's rewarding but it's hard to find postgraduate work as there are a lot more graduates than positions. You need to stand out.

As for gender bias, in my personal experience it's pretty good in Physics. At my university there were more issues in Engineering. I was one of my School's postgraduate equity officers for a year for context. 

I'm a man though so of course can't comment first hand, the only bad attitudes I've seen from other men have been from postgraduate students who have just moved over from overseas - they just need to have the proper etiquette explained to them. For example, you don't compliment a woman's looks in a professional setting. ""You are a beautiful lady, thank you very much"" is not an appropriate way to thank a woman for doing some work.

4) From what I've seen Professors either don't care about your coursework background or care specifically about your mathematics coursework background. I think the general sentiment is that as a physicist you can learn whatever physics you need 'on the job'.

5) Tips? Have a really good understanding of why you want to do astrophysics. You might find that you can find what draws you to astrophysics in another field with more employment opportunity.

234,"My school doesn’t offer an astrophysics major, but I’m a physics major with astronomy minor and chances are a lot of your coursework will be the same as a physics major.

&amp;#x200B;

1) While it’s very feasible to start research in your freshman year. Getting published that year is probably pretty rare. The only time I can think of that happening is if the paper is already near completion when you do something that merits you being listed as an author. That said it’s very very feasible to be listed as an author on something during your undergrad. It’s even pretty possible to be a lead or higher “ranked” author, especially if you’re PI gives you your own project. The best way to get started in research is to just cold email professors. If it’s a professor for one of your courses go into office hours, if it’s not just email them saying you’re interested in their research and that you wanted to discuss the possibility of working for them. Do your research on their work ahead of time and develop a relationship with them. There are internships in the field, but research through your school or through programs like REUs (research experience for undergrads) are more popular.

2) Chances are your studies will include orbital mechanics, especially in your physics 1, classical mechanics, and other astrophysics courses, but Those things do tend to be more engineering (you can probably take these courses as electives)

3) I am not a woman so I am not at all suited to answer this question, but as per my female friends in the field there is still a lot of sexism in the field and it is not always a welcoming environment towards women. They say things are definitely getting better, but there are still people, especially among older administrators and professors, that are sexists and there are still not many women in the field. My Department of Physics is very small, but I thought it was more balanced in population than a lot of the rest of the field. It turns out it is less balanced, its just that most of the people I interact with are in our Society of Physics Students and a majority of the women in the department are also a part of that group. Please take what I say with a subatomic grain of salt. I am a cis male.

4) I would not say that astrophysics is not preferred. By majoring in astrophysics you are certainly specifying early, but much of your coursework is going to be the exact same as a physics major and if you plan on doing a PhD in astrophysics anyway you'll be fine. Grad schools care more about your courses than what your degree says. Also, assuming you're applying/going to apply to colleges there is a good chance that when you start courses you come in undeclared. Even if you do come declared you can change your major.

5) Learn to work with others. Collaboration is hugely important in physics. I work on just about every problem set with others and its great. Also when you get to college take some classes outside of physics for fun. I didn't do this, but now that I can no longer fit fun classes into my schedule I am sad that I couldn't take some kind of studio art class or obscure elective.",1615747566,astrophysics,jdgoldfine,Astrophysics,Comment,569
236,"&gt;1) Is it possible to publish research as an undergrad as early as the first year? basically, how feasible is it to work with professors, get internships, get involved in research, etc?

Yes, because I did it.

But ""possible"" doesn't mean ""common"", nor does it mean that *you* will be able to do it. Many universities give preference to higher years when it comes to research, and many researchers prefer to take students after they've known them for *at least* a full year. Getting a position in a group when no one knows you and you have no evidence of skill in physics (high school is worthless for this) is hard.

Publishing is harder, and will often take &gt;1 year from the time you start in research. Not to mention, many projects will fail to produce anything publishable because that's just how science is, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about that.

&gt;2) Do the studies include orbital mechanics such as calculating orbital maneuvers, planning trajectories for spacecrafts, or skills required for working on missions, or are those part of aeronautical engineering? This seems like a dumb question but I'm not sure.

No, definitely not astrophysics at all. That's engineering, aeronautical or maybe aerospace. Astrophysics won't make you a good candidate for being an astronaut, if that's what you were hoping.

&gt;3) How rewarding is a career as an astrophysicist for women as in are there similar biases etc that I've heard women often face in stem related fields?

Depends on subfield. I don't feel out of place in theoretical black hole physics, and the more observational a field is (i.e. do you work with data that came from a real telescope), the more women dominate. A lot of areas are at about 50% or more for women.

&gt;Is majoring in astrophysics directly in undergrad not preferred if you want to do a Ph.D. later? I've had people advise me to major in physics instead as astrophysics may be too specialized.

Physics is advised because astrophysics will always sacrifice some pretty key physics classes at the upper levels. It's simply impossible for astrophysics to cover 100% of physics *plus* astro specific courses while still having the same number of classes overall as physics. Impossible.

And astrophysics is relatively easy to teach yourself (it's physics applied to space stuff, after all), whereas those fundamental advanced physics classes are near impossible to self-teach. And the astrophysics at the PhD level may rely on them, depending on project.

Easier to major in physics, preferably with a double in math or CS or statistics, and pick up any astro electives in your free time. Or don't. Most people who are successful in gaining entrance to an astro PhD will have a physics background, but astro is also an uncommon major. Take that as you will.

And if you change your mind about astrophysics, which you may seeing how young/inexperienced you are, it's a lot better to be partway through physics than astrophysics.

&gt;5) any general tips that you might want to share or anything to keep in mind for someone wanting to study this discipline?

Focus on the math. Focus on the fundamentals. Don't waste time worrying about your stellar atmospheres class. It's basically useless to you. Nobody gets tripped up by any of the topics in astro courses, they get tripped up by the fundamentals and the mathematics. Those will be the absolute limiters on your potential. If you cannot get the basics down and you cannot do well in the Calc series, you're in for a very rough time. If you find them to be so hard that you struggle to pass, or even fail, you need to think of other careers because those are not courses you can ""just pass"" and forget about. They'll haunt you forever.",1615746928,astrophysics,officially_anxious,Astrophysics,Comment,638
237,"Hi,

1. I think you'll have your course work for the first year and you would be occupied with that but if you really want to get into research and publish papers don't let it stop you. 

2. To be honest, I'm just about to complete my MSc Physics, and not astrophysics so I really don't know about this. Although Physics has a lot of everything basically and I had astrophysics as a subject which included solar astronomy and then galaxies and classifications etc. Nothing detailed.

3. I myself am not yet into the field enough neither have I any work experience, but generally I feel we the scientific community are better than the rest, and don't think such bias exist. And if it does let's change that.

4. If you're very sure about astrophysics major in it, but if you want to explore more of physics go for Physics instead of astro. It definitely will help, in my case I don't have colleges here that offer MSc in astrophysics, so I chose Physics instead. I'm from India btw.

1. Publishing research as an undergrad is not common since the background required to do original work in any area of astronomy/astrophysics is quite high and usually it's not until you reach masters level that students start collaborating in papers. 
2. Orbital mechanics yes. Spacecraft-related topics not really.
3. Can't really say much other than the number of female astronomy students is higher than other STEM subjects (in general, higher than Physics too). 
4. It's not very important because an undergrad in Astrophysics will have a large overlap with a Physics undergrad.

239,"&gt; 1) Is it possible to publish research as an undergrad as early as the first year? basically, how feasible is it to work with professors, get internships, get involved in research, etc?

It is possible to publish as an undergrad, but it is challenging. Of course this depends heavily on which institution you're studying at, but in general it can be hard just to find a professor to work with. Publishing a paper is several steps beyond that. However, it can happen if you try - keep talking to professors, with an emphasis on asking about original projects you could take on, and pursue those projects aggressively.     

&gt; 2) Do the studies include orbital mechanics such as calculating orbital maneuvers, planning trajectories for spacecrafts, or skills required for working on missions, or are those part of aeronautical engineering? This seems like a dumb question but I'm not sure.

These skills are generally not taught in astrophysics (or physics) majors. Like you said, aero is a better approach for this. If you'd like to study it on your own, I highly recommend  [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Astrodynamics-Dover-Aeronautical-Engineering/dp/0486600610).     

&gt; 3) How rewarding is a career as an astrophysicist for women as in are there similar biases etc that I've heard women often face in stem related fields?

In my time as an astro major, I did observe this to some degree, unfortunately. Like many things this will be heavily based on your institution. However, I think this kind of discrimination at the undergrad level is less common in astro than, say, mechanical engineering, or physics.    

&gt; 4) Is majoring in astrophysics directly in undergrad not preferred if you want to do a Ph.D. later? I've had people advise me to major in physics instead as astrophysics may be too specialized.

This depends on what you'd like to do your PhD in. If you'd like a PhD in astro, then an astro degree is good. If you'd like to get your PhD in a subfield of physics, consider double majoring. However when applying to PhD programs, remember that your major is not of much interest to the admissions committee. They will care much, much, much more about what kind of work you've done, and there's no rule saying you can't work with professors outside of your major. For instance, I see many physics majors take on astro projects, and they would be good astro PhD candidates.

&gt; 5) any general tips that you might want to share or anything to keep in mind for someone wanting to study this discipline?

A difficult question, but I think that the best thing you can do is keep an open mind. This field is huge, and especially when you're in the earlier years it can be detrimental to focus in too fast. You might be sure you want to work with exoplanets, but what if supernovae turn out to be more interesting? To that end, attend as many talks and classes as you can. Look up the professors at your school, and read the papers they have written! This will not only help you get research work, but also open your eyes as to what kinds of things are happening in your department.    

Astrophysics is a great field, and can be very rewarding. Good Luck!",1615746388,astrophysics,Itaer,Astrophysics,Comment,547

What would a 3D object like a sausage look like to a 2D being or how would a sausage with only a 2D brain understand itself.  It would see circular slices.  A wee small slice to start with and then growing as it ‘moved’ through or along the sausage until it hit a consistent diameter for a number of slices and then shrink again to nothing.  Beginning, middle, end.  The 2D being has seen the entire sausage but probably still can comprehend the entire sausage.

Move to 3D vs 4D, and transfer the concept where we are existing in a 4D world but understanding it or viewing it with our 3D concepts.

I think the point is that we are all living in a multi dimensional universe but can only see the dimensions below us and barely, if at all, understand the one above.

I suggest you look at the twin paradox. It doesn’t directly compare to your questions but it’s in the same vein. A ship travels away from Earth at relativistic speed, but because observers on both the Earth and the ship see themselves as stationary and the other as moving, they both predict that the other will be younger at any given moment. The ship leaving Earth turns around and comes back. Who will actually be older when it gets back? The paradox is resolved when you consider that the observer in the spaceship must accelerate to turn around, breaking the symmetry and establishing themselves as the younger one.

Zero relative velocity produces zero time dilation, not infinite. Traveling at the speed of light (impossible for massive objects) produces infinite time dilation. Look up the Lorentz factor to learn more.

275,"The answer is actually extremely simple:

It's space itself that is expanding. It's not expanding INTO anything, because there's nothing to expand into.

At this point, you're thinking ""that's not simple AT ALL"", and on one level, you're right!

The problem is that the human mind can't really comprehend the idea of non-existence, of literal nothingness. Oh, we try, and we can use some nice words to describe it, clever analogies that illustrate the basic idea... but deep down, none of us truly understands it. Not me, not you, not Hawking, not Einstein, nobody. We understand it at a very high, conceptual level, but there's no physical reality any of us has that we can relate it to in order to make sense of it.

THE ANALOGY 

Think of each gravitationally bound system as a penny, and glue a bunch of these pennies onto a balloon that is only slightly blown up. Now we blow up the balloon more. ALL of the pennies move away from each other uniformly, and those that are farther away from each other move away from each other faster than those that are closer together. If you choose ANY penny on the surface, it sees ALL of the other pennies moving away from itself and it sees the ones farther away moving away faster than those close by. No penny is the center of the expansion. There IS no center to the universe. That is the way the universe works and that is what the analogy is intended to show. The fact that all the pennies move away from each other and that ones farther away move away faster and that there is no center.

If we require the first two to be in exact conjunction and accept angular range of x for the third one then the chance it will be in that range is x/(2 pi), so naively we would expect the period to increase by a factor 2 pi/x.

309,"&gt;roughly the size of a typical O'neill Cylinder

So, 8kmx32km in the original according to the wikipedia; depending on rotation there might be variation in brightness, around something like a 24km diameter from [this table](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/ast_size_est.html); one can pick the albedo.  I'll use fairly dark, 0.1, so we're looking at about magnitude 12.  Right or at about the dimmest Messier targets, or, roughly available for our observation from the 18th century on.  Almost trivially photographed with backyard equipment.

&gt;that has a malfunctioning panel in its surface that is improperly reflecting/refracting light from the opposite side of the panel.

The panels provide camouflage, except for this one functioning panel?  How big is it?  The dimness goes down if we're looking at, say, a football field.  Take d=0.4km, magnitude \~20.  I've taken astrophotos with one hour sub-exposures and accumulated for 12+ hours, and I'm not sure, off the top off my head, that I have mag20 targets in my photos.  I might, but it's close to the backyard limit.  For professional equipment, it should still be observable at least within the orbit of ... I'll say Pluto.  Didn't calculate.

&gt;How would this sort of anomalistic phenomena show itself and be identified in the data?

A pixel would be moving and varying in brightness between subsequent exposures of the field.  Over time, the recorded positions could be used to derive the orbital elements, and therefore the path of the object within the solar system.

Depending on the camouflaging, there might be signals at other wavelengths, especially infrared, especially if the cylinder was inhabited / functional / using energy.   If the cylinder made no effort to hide its infrared signature, then its features might be, conceiveably, used for diagnosing the object as artificial.

The identification is the tricky part, until its close enough to be resolved as multiple pixels, which would take it inside the orbit of Mars (Deimos, with d=12km is still resolved as \~one pixel in [Hubble images](http://redplanet.asu.edu/?p=30221)).",1615452472,astrophysics,ketarax,Astrophysics,Comment,325

Not correct. Black holes do not significantly influence the gravitational dynamics of galaxies, spiral or otherwise.

336,"As for what you are proposing.....

As an amateur astronomer, I observe lunar and asteroid occultations. We(fellow observers) can time asteroid events of all sizes, it depends on how well the orbit of the asteroid is known. Bigger asteroids create a bigger path (star shadow) across the surface of Earth which means it will cover the star for a longer period of time compared to smaller asteroids, and even events from asteroids less than 10km can be observed.

in 99% (a guess) of the time, we can't even see (image) the asteroid since most are very dim (low surface brightness) , but we can see the star they are going to cover. Using telescopes up to 10"" diameter, we can make observations of stars down to 12th magnitude or so. The asteroids are usually much dimmer. The duration of events can be as short as a second up to 15 or so, usually.

The state of the art in capturing these events is to use a video camera which records the star and also has the time (very accurate) imbedded over the top of the video. Using analog cameras, the exposure time is based on the video type, NTSC (US standard) at 1/60th second per field (2 fields per frame), and PAL (Euro standard) which is 1/50th of a second. Digital astro cameras can image dimmer stars but sacrificing timing accuracy.

Keep in mind, we are not just pointing somewhere in the sky and hoping for the best, we use predictions that provide a list of stars and the times in which a known asteroid will pass in front of them. The predictions also provide a path (like a path of a total eclipse of the Sun), also referred to as a ground track of where we have to be to see a specific event.  To put things in perspective, I would say there is probably less than 5 events a year that will be visible from a single point on the Earth, which means we have to travel to see most of them.

What you are proposing would be like what we do without knowing which star will be blocked or when it will happen. Since the events are usually pretty short, you can't rely on a long exposure catching an event since if it happened, you wouldn't be able to notice it.

So, you would have to be able image a star field at some fraction of a second to find any mystery events. If you could make a BIG (1 meter sized telescope), fast (low f-ration) scope with a wide field of view, you might be able to find these events. But then what? The only pieces of data you have are a time, duration, and which star was covered.  You don't know by what or in what direction the object is moving. The empty space (from our point of view) between stars is huge. These events will not happen very often.

I guessing what you would find is Earth orbiting space junk causing most of the events and since some of the junk reflects light very well, the junk will sometimes be brighter than the star it is covering.

I think there are some observers who actually look for space junk occultations, though I have never tried it myself. The best I have done is to try to image the International Space Station (ISS) passing in front of the Sun or Moon.

There should be many links in on the web page that provides info that might come in handy for you.

354,"&gt; So wouldn't the two ends of the pole be trying to pull itself apart?

Yes they are. Lets roughly calculate the magnitude of the force.

The gravitational force between two objects (Earth and pole end) is given by

    F = G * mass_1 * mass_2 / distance_between_them^2

Lets say the bar is 1 kilometre in length and weighs 1,000 kg, and is orbiting at 36,000 kilometers. This is quite a long bar.

The force we get for the bottom of the bar is 222.018 newtons, the force we get for the top of the bar is 222.0075 newtons.

So the difference between them is 0.0105 newtons. That's the internal pulling force the bar is experiencing due to gravity. 

This is about the same as adding a 1 gram weight to the end of the bar. A bar which weights a ton and is 1 km long. This is miniscule.",1615368580,astrophysics,womerah,Astrophysics,Comment,150

357,"This is gonna be a long explanation but I'll try to use as many examples as possible to paint an accurate picture of how you should think about this. 

General relativity is built upon something called the principle of equivalence, which basically tells you that you can't distinguish between the effects of acceleration and a local gravitational field. For example, if you're in a spaceship accelerating upwards and away from earth, and you drop a ball and see it hit the spaceship's floor, you would not be able to tell if the ball hit the floor because the gravity from the Earth pulled it towards the floor, or if the floor was accelerated upwards to meet the ball. (note, ""local"" gravitational field is the key here, I can explain why we specify local if you're interested, but for simplicity I won't do it here)

Gravitational redshift (or blueshift) is basically a consequence of that. Suppose you're in the same rocketship accelerating upwards and away from the Earth, and you shone a light downwards (towards the Earth), you would perceive the wavelength of the light to be extended, since you're accelerating away from the direction the light is moving in, causing it to appear redshifted (see the Doppler effect). However, by the principle of equivalence, you wouldn't be able to tell if the light is being redshifted because the rocket is flying upwards, or the gravity from Earth is ""pulling it"" downwards. In other words, even if you were in space near the Earth moving with zero acceleration (i.e. constant motion), and you shine a light towards the Earth, you'd still perceive the light to be redshifted. This is what is called gravitational redshift (and gravitational blueshift is just the opposite, that is, the wavelength of the light is being decreased).

As for how this is all related to frequency, wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional. So, if wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa. This means that gravitational redshift is caused by a decrease in frequency, and blueshift by an increase in frequency.

So that answers the first part of your question, the second was about how this relates to time. Since you're reading Stephen Hawking's books, I assume you know a little about time dilation, which came from Einstein's special theory of relativity. Well turns out, there's a different kind of time dilation, that comes from Einstein's general theory of relativity.

It arises from the same principle of equivalence, so I won't go through another example, but in short, it says that the closer you are to a massive object (i.e. the stronger the gravitational field around you is), the slower time passes, and vice versa. This is opposite to the ""normal"" time dilation, where the faster you move, the slower time passes.

tl;dr, the closer you are to a massive object like the Earth, the stronger the gravitational field, the higher the frequency of light is shifted (via gravitational blueshift/redshift), and the slower time passes. (it might be more useful for you to think of gravitational redshift/blueshift and gravitational time dilation as 2 separate phenomena, rather than being the same thing)",1615357119,astrophysics,ZachTheYek,Astrophysics,Comment,523
358,"The terms 'dark matter' and 'dark energy' are not associated with each other and shouldn't be lumped together like that. The subject is only about spiral galaxies and their long term stability. 'Dark matter' pertains to the galactic scale. 'Dark energy' pertains to the extra-galactic scale, ""the energy of space-time itself"".  
  
This is all assuming the long term stability of a spiral galaxy is actually due to a rotation. The latest is this rotation is driven by a supermassive 'black hole' at the center. This one is a big ASS-umption. Notice how the image of a 'black hole' in M87 was derived from EHT but the center of the Milky Way, known to be a spiral galaxy, Sag A*is still being processed.

361,"That’s a really good question; and it seems that it’s mostly been answered already, but I’ll jump in with a more thorough explanation. The simple answer is yes, galaxies and other extended bodies hold themselves together via gravity (in other words, they are self-gravitating) and some don’t *need* dark matter in the strictest sense. 

Where this idea of galaxies needing dark matter comes from is the rotation curves that Vera Rubin measured and used as evidence for this unseen mass. The outskirts of galaxies show a flat rotation curve, exhibiting rapid rotation in the outskirts where the visible (baryonic) mass was insufficient to hold the galaxy together. It’s not the galaxies can’t hold themselves together without dark matter, but that we see rotational velocities that require it. (In the absence of dark matter, you would still have these spiral galaxies, but their rotation curves would look very different.)

Elliptical galaxies and dwarfs, which are supported by internal random motions, don’t even run into this rotational issue, though we know from their kinematics that they are more massive than their light would suggest. In fact, there is a population of galaxies that lack dark matter — an exemplar of this class is NGC 1052-DF2. As you might expect, galaxies that lack dark matter are more diffuse because there’s less enclosed mass to hold themselves together tightly. (On smaller mass scales, globular clusters, which are generally galaxy-like except for some key differences, are also self-gravitating, so dark matter is not essential for these bodies to self-gravitate.)

Dark energy does drive expansion, but not on small scales. It is only on cosmological scales that the expansion of the universe dominates over the gravity and random motions of smaller bodies, so, while you could think of dark matter and dark energy having essentially different effects, they don’t even operate on the same scales. (It’s a common misconception that they’re in some way connected because they’re both “dark”, but it’s really just evidence that astronomers are bad/lazy about names — black holes or big bang, anyone? ;))",1615343908,astrophysics,astropie25,Astrophysics,Comment,342

In my opinion, the Europe variant has lots of flexibility, but it is of course true that you will not be settled for your PhD as well. In general, my most important advice to anyone would be to chose a great supervisor for your projects. It is waaaay more important than the project itself.

Now imagine while assembling the puzzle you find a number of pieces that wont' fit anywhere. You can either keep searching for pieces that it may fit with, regardless of the whole, or you can set them aside so you may fit them back into the puzzle when you've completed more of it.

The Big Bang theory is the puzzle with the most pieces fit together, that has the most obvious shape.

At best, other theories may take one or two of the pieces the Big Bang can't fit in itself and tries to fit them together with each-other, or with other theoretical pieces. But those pieces are just 2-3 bunched together, they have no shape, and they usually can't be built off of to get an idea of a shape, and they won't fit back into the Big Bang puzzle with those additions.

453,"Mathematically, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that you cannot know the change in an object's momentum and position at the same time without some degree of uncertainty. That degree of uncertainty is h-bar/2. 

Every object also has a de Broglie wavelength which is attributed to its size and velocity which gives the wavelength of the wavefunction for any object. It's given by wavelength=h/mv. So a particle moving faster has a shorter wavelength because the denominator gets bigger as the velocity increases.

Now, only super super tiny particles moving super duper fast (the speed of light essentially) have de Broglie wavelengths around the same size of the objects themselves for the uncertainty principle to take effect. Anything else has in incredibly small wavelength, especially considering its size. 

A 1 solar mass star moving at 200 km/s has a de Broglie wavelength of about 1.66 x 10\^-69 m (compared to our Sun's radius of \~7 x 10\^5 km. Now, let's look at an electron, its wavelength is about 2.42 x 10\^-12 m and the radius of a hydrogen atom is one Bohr radius, or \~5 x 10\^-11 m. The uncertainty principle only really matters when your de Broglie wavelength is on the same scale as its physical size. 

Essentially, any change in position or velocity for a large object will clearly be above the h-bar/2 uncertainty value, while smaller objects don't have that luxury.

The other problem is with decoherence. Most of the time when someone is talking about the uncertainty principle in a textbook they are in an idealized environment where there is not a lot of interaction between the particle you are measuring, and the environment (decoherence). So, in a massive star there's simply too much B.S. going on for the particles to achieve a coherent state in which the particle is quantized.",1614710041,astrophysics,WunboWumbo,Astrophysics,Comment,303

457,"so basically the spherical shape of a star results from the equilibrium between the gravitational force and its internal fusion pressure -- its radius is directly determined from this relationship. however on occasion pressure instabilities and sometimes interactions with the electromagnetic force can cause stuff like flares. there is also of course the solar wind, which is basically caused by the outer layer of the sun being so goddamn hot that it manages to push against gravity and create a stream of charged particles flowing out from the sun. this almost seems like what you are picturing -- however this amount of mass loss is negligible compared to the size of the sun, and even over its entire lifetime has only lost around 0.0001 solar masses. there are certainly stars with much larger mass loss rates out there though, even some that as you say lose a more significant portion (i wouldn't go so far as to say *most* but not entirely ruling it out either, over a stellar lifetime). 

to bring it back to your original question, the Uncertainty Principle does not apply to really any of this, as this is not a quantum-scale system and the sun is not a quantized particle. if you are just thinking of measurement error, then also not really, as we know the size of the sun very accurately, and the amount of mass that it is losing is miniscule. plus, we know the rate of mass loss very precisely as well, so we can easily model it and account for it as we take measurements over time (also since the solar wind generates from the corona, it's already consisting of particles that are outside of the visible ""radius"" that we define for a star). As for any other star in the universe -- we have to calculate its radius from observed/inferred temperature and distance to us since they are too far away to directly measure their apparent sizes. the error would then come down to the instruments measuring these luminosities/temperatures, and the distance metric used. in any of these cases the inherent error in measurement is going to be orders of magnitude greater than just about any stellar mass loss to solar wind, so again it would not really factor in to any certainty in measurement for stellar radius.",1614700061,astrophysics,Jobboman,Astrophysics,Comment,387

My hope is that it can be a stable configuration, it's apparently common for binary stars but I'm exploring the thought experiment as though they were stable earth-like bodies. 

I'm trying to process your answer, it seems the rotational spin of the two bodies in this system wouldn't evolve into a tidal lock because of the eccentricities of the elliptical orbit... can we assume that their individual spin would maintain an equilibrium?

Is this a stable configuration? As far as I understand it. Tidal locking happens because the three body Problem is generally very unstable. Conservation of angular momentum will then drive the spin towards tidally locking.
So in your case: the angular momentum of the spin would need to be transferred to somewhere else (to the rotation) which would destabilise the rotation?!

Question 2: people on the surface of these objects would feel tidal forces. You can think of it like the tidal forces of our moon (ebb and tide for instance). But since the two objects are of equal mass their tidal forces would be way stronger!! I think it would disrupt everything.

520,"A planet forms from a protostellar nebula, which forms from a star-forming cloud called a ""molecular cloud"". These are big clouds that form multiple stars before dispersing.

However, the gas in a molecular cloud doesn't come from any one particular star or supernova. It comes from the *interstellar medium*, which is the turbulent mix of thin gas in the Milky Way. This is mostly primordial hydrogen &amp; helium that dates back to the Big Bang, but has also been ""polluted"" by supernova and stellar winds, which have contributed heavier elements, as well as their own hydrogen and helium. But stellar winds and supernova remnants very quickly dissipate into the general mix of the interstellar medium.

So the elements of our solar system, our planet, and everything on it, was not produced in any one particular star. In the end, it's the same problem as trying to determine which tree produced the oxygen you are breathing - in that case, it's really the result of a whole planet worth of life and other processes producing oxygen over billions of years, and the atmosphere is so thoroughly mixed that it's impossible to track any particular atom back to some particular tree.",1614164015,astrophysics,Astrokiwi,Astrophysics,Comment,199

I suspect most of it won't have escape velocity from the solar system, it certainly won't be moving off into the interstellar medium at any significant fraction of the speed of light. The volume of space taken up by planets in the galaxy is very, very small, so the amount of this theoretical escaped hydrogen that's going to coincide with a planet's cross section will be essentially zero.

I suppose it stands to reason that a few atoms from the galactic stellar winds must end up here once in a while... but the volume of such atoms here on earth compared to those in the primordial cloud would be absolutely miniscule.",1614141282,astrophysics,RoboticElfJedi,Astrophysics,Comment,135

537,"Do you mean, a particular star that some earth-matter definitely came from? The answer to that is certainly no. Galaxies are quite dynamic things, and the process by which our galaxy's gas - originally hydrogen and helium - is gradually enriched with heavier elements is a complex one. Heavy elements and gas are pushed out by supernovae and other processes, mixed, cool down, rain back onto the galaxy, collapse into clouds of molecular gas, and from this stars like ours are born. 

The heavy elements you're mostly thinking of won't be blown away by stellar winds in general, they need a more energetic process to liberate them and send them out - like the aforementioned supernova. So to see a star that may have contributed to your own body, we need to look at supernova remnants. Yes, there are (for example) white dwarf stars visible from earth. White dwarfs cool over time, and we can't possibly know which ones would have been in what part of the galaxy billions of years ago, but there might be some that are visible and old enough to have contributed material to the molecular cloud that formed earth.

570,"It depends, both on what you consider significant and on the nature of the travel. Time will dilate for observers in strong gravitational fields, like near a black hole. Time also dilates as the observer’s velocity relative to earth approaches the speed of light. This dilation is given by the Lorentz factor γ=1/sqrt{1-v^2 / c^2 }. The time passed in the travelers frame is Δt’=γΔt where Δt is time passed on Earth. So, when the traveller is moving at 0.87 times the speed of light, for every second that passes for them, 2 seconds will have passed on Earth. If you image search for “Lorentz factor” you can see how γ changes with v.

Whenever you're making a big decision like this, try to take in as many opinions that you can, but recognize that not all opinions are created equal, and the most valuable ones will probably come from people who know you well, especially if they know how you work. This would be teachers if you're in school. That said, I'd only take advice from teachers you have a good relationship with. Take your time, try different things, and know that if you are willing to put the work in there are several points at which you can change direction if things aren't working out. As degrees go, astonomy/astrophysics/physics degrees are fantastic for giving you flexibility in future employment. The creative problem solving skills you develop in them are sought after by a wide range of employers that pay well and most have high job satisfaction. Engineering degrees have similar prospects, but engineering tends to promote more rigid, less creative thinking (there are lots more rules when peoples lives are at stake). Don't go into medicine unless you have a passion for it - the fraction of doctors that are unhappy is astonishingly high.

The past 4 decades has been the Vatican on their last flop, and they have been flopping for 500 years. It has been Vatican Apologists that have formally  institutionalized specific terminology for specific phenomena, such as 'dark energy', 'dark matter', 'big bang', 'black hole', stars that 'swallow', 'gorge', 'feast',  'devour', etc. digestive tract functions in outer space (hint: stars aren't 'born', 'live', or 'die', they are machines not living beings, they form, they function, the fuel runs out, they go cold).  
  
The past 4 decades has also been an Anti-Science assault, under the guise of Pro-Science cloaking, the Anti-Science Science-Illiterate (A.S.S.I.). Their numbers are legion.  
  
Basic stats are astrophysicists have had 0% unemployment for many years, and that is including undergrads. In many ways, the decision at this point in time needs to take into account what the economy is doing in 4 years. Everything is being propped up with toothpicks and dental floss right now. The fact is, if the US goes into a deep recession, the rest of the planet goes into depression.  
  
The simple fact is tourism is dead for at least 2 more years. Commercial aircraft orders have dropped off a cliff. Cruise ships are being turned into scrap. All these industries have tens of thousands of mechanical engineers, aeronautical engineers, ship building engineers, computer programmers. By this summer, aeronautical and aerospace engineers are going to be a dime a dozen. Balloons look so strong and stable until they are all stretched out, and a tiny little needle, KABLOOM! That is the nature of collapse.  
  
The situation now is NASA is almost entirely data acquisition. They just collect data. Since NASA is the President's Agency, they have never been given instructions what to do with that data. They are only realizing that in the past 10 years, that they are literally being buried with Big Data. One example, LRO has been in continuous operation around the Moon, sending an estimated 2 petabytes of data. Right now, that is on hard drives, so 2,000 1 Terabyte hard drives. T.E.S.S. is using the Gaia catalog as Control, and that is 1.7 Billion stars. LOL, they are calling it the Point Source Catalog. NASA really doesn't have a Big Data budget line so they are offloading to MIT and the Smithsonian.  
  
It is probably a 50% washout rate in undergraduate astrophysics, though. The best thing to do for marketability is have a minor in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence Programming.",1613925226,astrophysics,moon-worshiper,Astrophysics,Comment,431

-	Homework? Do it yourself. If you’re stuck, be respectful of other people’s time and show what you’ve done and why you’re stuck. (FWIW that’s a pretty common approach on Reddit and other online Q&amp;A sites.)
-	Study/career advice. Mostly hard to answer because it’s so country and education system dependent. Posters often fail to provide anything but minimal details.
-	Searchable questions. If you put the salient points of your question into a search engine, would you get an answer? When you know a subject thoroughly, it’s easy to know when a lazy question is being asked and would be answered by a single search. Reddit isn’t Google.
-	Crankery. If it looks like speculative fiction, worldbuilding or just plain pseudoscience, it’s a hard pass from me.

* degree minors aren't really a thing, so for the most part a physics degree is a physics degree. Some universities offer e.g. ""Physics and/with Astrophysics"" but this is really just a physics degree with some otherwise optional courses made mandatory
* A standard UK degree is three years long, but for physics it's common to do an ""integrated masters"" degree which bumps it up to four years, and you graduate once at the end with a MPhys qualification (and would then go straight into a PhD)

I also recommend looking up some public lectures on YouTube, anything by Caltech is amazing and they even publish their classes online so if you're stuck on a topic during your degree you can probably find the topic online and someone to walk you through it.  Also Khan Academy is so so useful! You can also look on eventbrite for events and talks being run on zoom by universities at the moment as they are all free!

677,"I went to a state-run academy - it was around the 6th worst in the whole is Scotland when I left for uni - so I can't give any details on the religious-ran schools but as long as it's not private they are still required to teach the current curriculum so try not to worry about their opinions too much. If you have a good physics teacher (or teacher in general) I would definitely talk to them as they will be able to help you out a lot, especially with applications and such. Sometimes physics teachers will also coordinate their own outreach event (or know someone who does) so try to make lots of contacts!  They might also have some independent study that you can do or help set you up with one that interests you during your higher year. Im pretty sure you do a topic report (literature review) during your National 5 in 4th year (I did mine on radio carbon dating, which is nothing to do with what I do now but I really loved it a lot and made me want to study physics even more) so during that time you could pick something that really appeals to you. 

A lot of astrophysics is computational based so good on you for taking computing! I've only ever formally learnt python (which is probably the most common coding language among astrophysicists) but C and C# are also used occasionally. You can use codeacademy online which is free if you want to start learning. 

It's really cool you're near the Royal Observatory! I've never worked there but I wouldn't discount some of the smaller ones as you are likely to get more time to learn the ropes, so to speak.  I did my observational training during my Masters at St Andrews Observatory which is a very small and old observatory but you can still learn a lot! 

I personally skipped college and also my final year of high school. I did my 5 highers in 5th year and left straight into first year of university which was definitely the right choice for me. I did a general physics degree with an integrated masters which meant that I had full funding from the Scottish Government (SAAS) for the full 5 years as long as I didn't have to repeat a year which worked out nicely for me. 

I don't know a huge amount about the University of Edinburgh at undergraduate level but when I was looking for PhDs they were largely theoretical based at the time - a lot of heavy computer modelling and cosmology - which was not for me. I was offered a project at the University of Heriot Watt but it was more optics and laboratory based than I was looking for. 
I would say the best astrophysics (or general physics with an opportunity to study astrophysics) in Scotland is probably the University of Glasgow, University of Edinburgh, University of Dundee, University of Strathclyde, and the University of St Andrews (but this was back when I was applying almost 6 years ago!). You should finding course that works for you and also if you like the university and staff (good student:staff ratio / big prestigious university, for example). 

Definitely keep an open mind about what you want to study, it could change dramatically as you learn more! Hope this is helpful ☺",1613740475,astrophysics,classic_complexity,Astrophysics,Comment,565

680,"The first step is to pick A level Maths and Physics. For the best undergrad courses you'll have to aim for at least an A* in one of these and an A in the other but some may only ask for As. I'd also recomend Further Maths if your school offers it but it is in no way required. For your final choice just pick something you love regardless of whether you think it fits the course you want to apply for, it's important to still enjoy yourself.

Once you start year 12, begin looking for universities with good Physics and Astronomy departments. There's plenty of resources online but UCAS is probably the best way to search and you should end up using it later to apply anyway. If you want a career in the field, it's worth looking at the 4 year MPhys courses rather than 3 year BSc. They're almost identical but the former includes a research project in the final year and is a better springboard into higher postgraduate courses.

685,"Hey! Astrophysics PhD student in the UK here! It's really awesome that you're thinking of pursuing a career in astrophysics, I definitely was not sure what I wanted to do at your age. 

I completed high school in Scotland (gonna assume from you saying s3) and I took just a wide range of academic subjects (English, Mathematics, Physics, History, French, and Music) so I had as many options as possible.  This made me feel very well rounded going into university and the essay-based subjects really helped with my ability to easily write lab reports and such. I think the only other subject I wish I had taken would be chemistry because it becomes very useful in the later years of university (condensed matter classes were real hard without any chem background but not impossible). 

If you're outside of Scotland (doing A levels) I know there isn't a huge opportunity for practical projects or independent research during high school as it's really exam heavy so if you can get involved with a local observatory (I shadowed a retired astronomer and helped him set up for presentations and such) I definitely recommend getting involved! 
If you are in Scotland you should get the chance to do a independent research project for a month (I think, I did the new highers but this was a long time ago for me lol) and you can try to do an astro based one which really demonstrates your interest and would look good on a UCAS application.

These beams are essentially hotspots on the surface where the magnetic field lines interact with the surface of the star. As these stars whip around so do the hotspots.

744,"Ok, then you really only had Newtonian mechanics plus a bit of special relativity as it is typically thought in the first year. This brings us a bit into the problems of the typical physics curriculum, where you have an experimental track and a theoretical track. These two are typically phase shifted by half a year to a year, i.e., one often teaches Newtonian mechanics, some special relativity (i.e., Lorentz transforms) and some thermodynamics in the first semester of a modern physics course. This is traditionally done by putting the experiment in the center and then by explaining the phenomena that you see there by ""deriving"" the laws of nature from these experiments. This is good, since this teaches you the general approach to physics: our job is to explain how nature works, and we do this by observing nature, making experiments, and then drawing conclusions from these in the language of mathematics. In many cases this works well, especially since in the typical conditions in which we live, many relationships are linear or quadratic, and so things look nice.

The problem with this approach, however, is that it obfuscates the underlying structure of the theory (in this case classical mechanics and thermodynamics). This is something that requires more mathematics, and since this is typically taught in parallel, we have to wait until you know the mathematical basics. And while this often helps, there are cases where one needs to explain more complex issues, using only the tools that you already know. Good examples are the wave equation, results that one can easily derive with Fourier transforms, and things like that. And that's where students then leave the lectures a bit shell shocked...

The good thing is that in principle, all of these results can be easily derived in the framework of ""proper"" classical mechanics (i.e., using the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approach, with some additional knowledge from the theory of differential equation thrown in). Initially, this will ALSO come as a shock to you, but I guarantee to you that a year later or so there will be a point where you start how these different approaches all connect to each other, and where you'll see the beautiful structure that is physics (but, yes, the formalistic mathematical approach that one has to choose when doing ""proper"" theoretical mechanics can be intimidating first; but it isn't).  Just learn to see that mathematics is the language that we use in physics. The problem many students have is that they're learning to ""speak mathematics"" at the same time at which they're also learning how to do physics, and often the maths will obfuscate the physics. So, if you want to have it easier in the long run, try to become ""fluent"" in maths as quickly as possible, be solving calculus problems and taking a look at differential equations. The sooner they aren't intimidating to you, the sooner you can concentrate on the physics. And then things like waves and so on won't be a problem anymore.",1613155145,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,503
745,"Ah, so that'll be slightly different again then. On the theory side that'll involve working with numerical simulations, probably with some stellar dynamics thrown in which has a bit of a thermodynamics/statistical mechanics flavour. For observational stuff you'll most likely be working with Gaia data.

Another thing to consider is that there tends to be a cyclical nature to astro research and these two fields are at somewhat different points in their cycles: Gaia data is periodically rolling in, so there's lots of new science being published right now. Whereas the next-generation galaxy surveys like DESI are just getting started (likewise JWST which will be big in the next few years), so you're potentially more likely to be working on analysis pipelines and early results.

The universe is still expanding. This does not mean that everything in it is increasing in size, it simply means that more empty space is ""being made"". This does not affect objects gravitationally bound to each other (such as solar systems, galaxies, galaxy clusters), the distance is only increasing between separated galaxy clusters. For example, if you measured the distance between two galaxy clusters, you'd get a number. If you performed the same measurement again at some point in the future, you'd find out that the number is now larger. This isn't because the galaxies are moving away from each other, but because the emount of empty space between them (the distance between them), is increasing, as if out of nothing, without them actually physically moving away from each other. This happens everywhere, uniformly, at the same rate, and it's also what happened during the Big Bang, just EXTREMELY quickly - the universe increased from about the size of a proton to about the size of a grapefruit in less than 10^-35 seconds (that is a 1 with 35 zeroes after it).
It's also incorrect to say that the universe expanded from a single point (a singularity) - that is an obsolete hypothesis based purely on relativity - it does not take quantum theory into account. The more commonly-accepted theory these days is the theory of the inflaton field. The inflaton was a a scalar field at an energy equilibrium across the entire universe.

Second thing: if gravity is a force and is unified with other forces at high energies then the meta force would possibly work very different from gravity and maybe no black holes were possible at that stage.

Third thing: the expansion of the universe. Even if the Universe started to collapse into a black hole inflation made spacetime expand faster than light.

805,"Classic example of how taking Street Slang and raising it to the level of Science Jargon has resulted in nothing but mass confusion.  
  
These Street Slang terms need to be used with scare quotes: 'black hole', 'dark energy', 'dark matter', 'big bang'.  
  
A classical 'black hole' is a Cold Collapsed Star. It is not 'black' or a 'hole', so why keep calling it a 'black hole"", then proceed to spend endless hours, years, decades, asking ""What is black?"", ""What is a hole?"". A Cold Collapsed Star is one that has converted all its local fuel to heavy elements. It has gone Cold, i.e. No Infrared, no heat, no light. It is black because it is no longer emitting photons. It is not 'trapping photons', it has no photons to emit. The size of the star was about 3 times the local star, the Sun. Once the fusion reaction ceased, the star collapsed into itself. The Action was Implosion, the Reaction was a Super Nova. That compressed the matter of the original star down into the volume of a small asteroid. There is no 'hole', there is still super dense matter at the center. This image of a 'black hole' is not a photograph, it is a colorization of very faint radio waves being emitted by the photons trapped in the photon n-sphere, the region before the Schwarzschild Radius, the Event Horizon, which starts at the original radius of the star before it collapsed. Also, the Schwarzschild radius expression is outdated. It is only for a non-rotating body and it is now known the collapsed core is rotating at relativistic angular velocity.   
https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-020-02717-3/d41586-020-02717-3_18408324.gif  
  
If you look at that optically, there is nothing there.  
  
The Street Slang terms 'dark energy' and 'dark matter' are using the word ""dark"", not as a color or lack of light, but a Metaphor for ""mysterious"". It is also to imply that 'dark energy' and 'dark matter' do not interact with Light, the photon. It is essentially optically transparent. There is only a very slight gravitational interaction, and this interaction can only be observed through secondary effects over the distance of billions of light-years.  
  
The term 'dark energy' is referring to the Ether. Einstein didn't write E=mc^2, it was a reporter that did that, due to the units, joules equals joules. Einstein's Special Relativity solution for the mass-energy equivalency expression was Eo=m, which doesn't make much sense, since it is saying joules equals kilograms. This was when the feud between Einstein and Tesla began.

817,"You throw the ball down and it flies towards earth but that same vector direction a quarter of an orbit later will be in front of you along your orbital path.

You'd have to throw it hard enough so that it reaches earth before you really progress round your orbit enough that the original direction you threw it in no longer points towards Earth.

826,"Google search hertzsprung russell diagram and then click images. This will display dozens of examples, each one slightly different. 

I know very little about tattoos, but here are some ideas for simplifying the HR Diagram into a tattoo.

-  You will notice most HR Diagrams have very colorful stripes representing the color/classification of stars. In [this video ](https://youtu.be/SvaXfFgrKg4) only the stars are colored. This would be better. for a tattoo.  

- Let your skin be the background color. 

- Leave out the x- and y- axis letters and numbers. Let the diagram be a pattern of colorful.dots on your skin.  

- For stars off the main sequence, draw a few larger dots representing some  red-giants, red supergiants, and blue supergiants. (You will see examples in  some diagrams on Google.)

- Mark out the future path of the dying Sun as it becomes a red giant and eventually a white dwarf.  Know what this path means and why it zig-zags so you can explain it to people. (You will see this path in some examples on Google.) 

The HR Diagram has been called the Mendeleev Periodic Table for astronomy because the star patterns contain so much information about stars.  I love the HR Diagram because the birth, life, dying and death of every star can be traced out on the diagram.

833,"Density is weight divided by volume(volume is how much space something takes up). Meaning that objects with high density have a lot of weight for the amount of space they take up. For example a bowling ball that weighs 5kg and a football that weighs 1kg are about the same size however due to them taking up the same amount of space lets say 1 meter cubed, the bowling ball is more dense due to more weight being packed into the same area. Specifically the bowling ball has a density of  5kg/meter cubed while the soccer ball has a density of 1kg/meter cubed.

Density does not change as you scale up, if I make the same comparison but now enlarge my football's volume by 5 to get a 5kg, 5 meters cubed ball the density is still going to be 1kg/meter cubed because 5kg/5 meters cubed = 1 kg/meter cubed.

860,"You're in the good situation that St. Andrews, Edinburgh, and Glasgow all have strong departments. You can also do astronomy as an undergraduate in Dundee, but that's a step down.

Of the three, Edinburgh is the largest. They are very strong in instrumentation and have a very good cosmology/extragalactic astronomy group, but really, you'll find specialists in most area of astronomy there. Their location is great.

St. Andrews I'd mostly associate with extrasolar planets, overall, their research portfolio is a bit more narrow than Edinburgh, but that won't matter at the undergraduate level. Their smaller size might help with getting in contact with people. But then, St.  Andrews is a bit in the middle of nowhere.

Glasgow is a strong physics department with an astronomy group that is a tad bit smaller than St. Andrews. They are mainly concentrating on plasma physics and solar astronomy, plus gravitational physics.

In general, any BSc /MSc in physics will prepare you for astrophysics, since the specialization phase will come later. However, the larger astronomy groups will typically invite many speakers, so you get a feeling for how astronomy works, and they might also have more offers, e.g., to do some research over the summers. Finally, all of these departments also do interesting physics outside of astrophysics.

Yeah.

They're separate, that is, not ""attached to space"", but ""free to move about it"".  But that doesn't mean objects wouldn't get distorted along with space.  In fact, I'd say objects are ""softer"" than space, which is rather very rigid (takes a stellar mass to make a decent dent).

Yup.

I studied a BTEC in Applied Science at college before attending university, and the degree consisted mostly of biology and chemistry, but that didn't stop me pursuing physics! 

From what I can tell, the mathematics is your main issue here. A physics degree is 80% mathematics, but that doesn't mean to say you need to be a whizz in order to do well. Universities will offer workshops and booster classes for those struggling with mathematics, and if you discuss this with your professors they will also want to help. 

Before starting university it had been 5 years since I had any formal mathematics education, and that was barebones gcse level too! (which I failed twice lmao). See if your college offer transition years or foundation years for physics, a foundation year will start from very basic maths (number lines, division, addition etc.) and build you up to doing calculus and partial fractions (the same for physics topics on that course). 

I hope this as well as my personal experience has helped, and I say go for the switch! Feel free to dm me if you want to talk some more!",1612221638,astrophysics,Alfreb_Einstime,Astrophysics,Comment,309
892,"A strong understanding of mathematics is vital for any field in physics.

It's ok if you are slow with learning math topics if you do eventually learn them. You might struggle and progress slower than others, but if you are able to push through and learn the math, you should be fine. 

Perhaps you just haven't been shown math topics in the right environment yet. One of my favorite aspects of astrophysics is how it provides context to many initially ambiguous concepts. 

My undergraduate degree was in physics with a focus on astronomy/astrophysics so I can't say anything towards a specific astrophysics degree. But for my degree, it was nearly all math-based physics classes. And when it wasn't straight math, it was applications of those concepts.

First were stars, then they attracted each other to form globular clusters. The ones that started rotating formed galaxies. Stars first form about 13.7 billion Earth-years ago, galaxies don't start forming until around 13.3 billion Earth-years ago. These first galaxies were very small. They started merging (not colliding) rapidly about 11 billion Earth-years ago. The Milky Way is about 10 billion Earth-years old, and it has globular clusters in it that are over 12 billion Earth-years old, with some stars approaching 13 billion Earth-years old.

897,"The phenomenon you described only works if there is another system near the black hole. In the case you described, it’s the accretion disc. But it could be any other system, even another black hole.

What is happening is there is energy within the black hole, but there is also energy (spread across the entire universe) due to the presence of the black hole at the given location. That’s the gravitational potential. And when you position another object somewhere in the universe, the two objects combined share a gravitational potential energy described only by their masses and their relative distance. 

The energy that you dissipate from this system when they come closer or merge is lost from this potential energy, in form of gravitational waves. But that means you also increased the energy of the single original black hole in the process by adding the second object to it.

So the phenomenon you described would add to the energy of the original black hole, but would take away energy from the system of the black hole plus the other object. This is not evaporation.

Black holes do evaporate, due to a completely different quantum phenomenon, even just when they are standing by alone in the universe. But that is not gravitational waves.

How much of a galaxy can be converted to energy is simply the difference between the original configuration of the galaxy, with positions and masses of its constituents, and the final configuration with all the constituent matter as part of the black hole. The energy is purely due to the distribution of mass here.

There is an interesting branch of science that leads off into how to harness small black holes for our use- caging one of only a few solar masses (event horizon only a couple dozen kilometres wide,) in a mirror structure and bombarding it with electrons.

* The Big Bang was not an explosion, and it does not have a centre. 
* The theory of the Big Bang doesn't make claims about how or why the Universe began; all it says is that the Universe was smaller, hotter and denser in the past.
* All galaxies formed at approximately the same time, soon after the Big Bang (although ""new"" galaxies have since been formed by these original galaxies merging together).
* We see galaxies stratified by age as we look further out into the cosmos, because the light from more distant galaxies that we see today started travelling many millions of years ago - looking outwards means looking back in time.
* Supermassive black holes are an important force in galaxy evolution, but accretion of the BH is not the same as growth of the galaxy. And moreover the BH has very little gravitational influence on the galaxy - it is primarily the combined mass of stars and gas (in addition to unseen dark matter) whose gravitational attraction holds galaxies together.

903,"Just to make it doubly clear: the ""gas pulled out by an interaction"" theory is completely gone and obsolete. I remember seeing that hypothesis in old textbooks but it's very old and never made that much sense in the first place. Interactions between passing stars are extremely rare, and do not seem to produce planets - you would get a disruption event where a flare of gas is thrown out of the solar system, and you definitely wouldn't get planets in nice nearly-circular orbits. Planets also seem to be very common. It's hard to detect planets around other stars, but they seem to be basically everywhere as far as we can tell. We have detected some systems with multiple planets, all apparently in the same plane. So whatever produces planets has to be something near universal - it can't be the result of a freak event. It also needs to produce planets in a nice plane with near-circular orbits most of the time.

Planets forming form a disc of gas around a protostar easily does all of this. Discs are easy to form whenever you have (dissipative) gas and angular momentum, and we have observed what appear to be protoplanetary discs, so we know they exist for sure. Discs will naturally produce planets in a plane with nice circular orbits, because the gas particles are already in a plane with circular orbits.

The disc theory is so solid that it's really not going to be displaced.

905,"&gt;&gt; Dark energy is not causing the expansion of the universe but the acceleration of the expansion.

&gt;Do we know how??

Yes, see FLRW model. basically the universe has several ingredients : matter (dark and baryonic), radiation and dark energy. We then ask how a uniform soup of these components will gravitationally involve, using the Einstein equations of general relativity. Depending on how much there is of each of those you get a different time evolution. Dark energy has the gravitational effect of causing *accelerated* expansion. 


&gt;When you say ""dark energy"", are you referring to dark matter?

No. They are two completely different things. 


&gt;If so, could it simply be because there is an entire dark universe we can't see, where there is more than just void to expand into?

That makes no sense really and isn't accurate. Dark matter has nothing to do with dark energy and it's in the danger places as matter (but more diffuse because it doesn't and can't form small scale structures due to the lack of self interaction).

The expansion of the universe is the increase in distance between any two given gravitationally unbound parts of the observable universe with time. It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. The universe does not expand ""into"" anything and does not require space to exist ""outside"" it. As the spatial part of the universe's spacetime metric increases in scale, objects move apart from one another at ever-increasing speeds.

957,"Again,  not directly. It's in congruence with what general relativity would predict, namely that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. In that scenario, which was undoubtedly groundbreaking and sensational, it worked out because scientists started with the assumption that they travel at the speed of light. Based on the properties of the gravitational waves they predicted that there would be a light signal, so they went looking for it, and they indeed found it. Which is absolutely phenomenal, no question there.

 But did this measurement actually test that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light? No, it didn't. It relied on it, and it worked out, to some uncertainty of measure. Which of course is always the nature of measurements.

960,"&gt;And through calculation we can find if space expansion is accelerating or decelerating.

No, through measurement. It was actually a surprise to find that the inflation is accelerating. No one had thought about that. It was found through what is called the ""Standard Candle"" - that is a Type 1a Supernova where a White Dwarf in a binary system goes Supernova by taking on Mass from its companion Star. That is (mostly) because there is the ""Chandrasekhar limit"" - 1,44 the Mass of our Sun - where electron degeneracy pressure is unable to prevent collapse. (there are some [interesting animations of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhkWx8-efq0) but these are just artist impressions). However there are probably ""super-Chandras"" which exceed that limit.

962,"&gt;I am aware this might sound very stupid.

Actually, it's an excellent question! Very often the most simple questions are the really good ones, and very often they are the hardest to answer. If you don't believe me, just try asking a physicist (or any other scientist for that matter) what space or time is and watch them sweat.

&amp;#x200B;

Indeed Einstein's general relativity predicted (or postulated, one might argue) that any signal, energy, or information could travel through space with maximally the speed of light. The reason for that is that can be explained with the special relativity, where we don't think about matter curving space and all of that funny business yet, but just take space to be flat. (Think of a nice, regular grid that represents space in any direction.) Experiments have shown that the speed of light in any frame of reference (so called 'inertial system') in vacuum is constant. For example, consider sitting on a train that is going very very fast. If you now have two flashlights, and point one in the direction that the train is going, and the other one in any other direction, for example perpendicular to the direction of the drive, or in the direction the train came from, then when measuring the speed at which the light from the flashlights propagates from where you're standing is going to be the same in each direction. But the more interesting thing is: It will also be the same if you would be measuring from outside the train! Now that's some mind boggling stuff right there. 

To get from that fact to the entire theory of relativity takes a lot of explaining, something that wouldn't fit on a reddit post, but rather in a book or two. However, the main point is that nothing, no signal, information, or mass, or energy, can travel faster than the speed of light. That's just how nature is. So to answer your question: Yes, gravity is not instantaneous; It travels at the speed of light.

Now surely any inquisitive mind would ask: Do you have any proof for it? The answer is: Not directly, no. The constant speed of light can be shown and measured, look into the Michelson-Morley experiment. But with other forces, it's much more difficult.

However, the speed at which gravity is travelling is a prediction of general relativity, and many other predictions of it rely on that. So in a sense, if you can find any experiment that supports general relativity, then the propagation velocity of gravity being at the speed of light is supported as well - simply because if it weren't, the other predictions (which are supported by measurements and experiments) rely on that that is the case. That's why I say there is *no direct proof* \- it's supported by other findings, but hasn't been measured (to my knowledge) yet.",1612036701,astrophysics,AthenasLilOwl,Astrophysics,Comment,481

965,"&gt;My question is, would gravity behave in the same way? I mean, obviously we are in an orbit around the sun as it travels through the galaxy, if it disappeared would the earth go flying in a straight line? Would it take 8 minutes for the Orbit to disappear as well? Would there be some kind of gravitational tsunami because the sun would just disappear?

Yes, that is what Gravity Waves are and they, too, travel at the Speed of Light. If the Sun would just instantly disappear it would ""ripple"" Spacetime which sends out Gravity Waves - which would ""push"" Earth out of Orbit, but its momentum would send it flying in a straight line away.",1612031643,astrophysics,pkarlmann,Astrophysics,Comment,117

In order for enough gravity to leak into the other dimensions, they would have to be large, or there would have to be a lot of them. There is currently no evidence that there are any extra dimensions besides the four we know.

Dark matter needs to have mass and travel slowly. Gravitons are massless and travel at the speed of light, so they are useless as a dark matter candidate.

Stars that are a few hundred times more massive though, when they run out of hydrogen they fuse helium, then they start fusing heavier and heavier materials, its is core shrinking to fuse these materials while its outer layers expand, eventual it tries iron, which is when is fused together, generates 0 energy to fight the gravity that is causing it to collapse.

The star then explodes in what is known as a super nova if the core is under 3 solar mass (3 times the mass of the sun) the result is a super dense ball with a shell of iron with a soup of neutrons inside, this is called a neutron star, if it is over 3 solar masses then it completely collapses to a point of infinite density, barely a dot called a singularity, or as you might call it, a black hole.

Because of Gravity and the Electro-Weak force, which holds Galaxies and us together, there are of course also Objects moving towards us - like Andromeda - and as such are blueshifted.

[This is usually explained using a rubber balloon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDTPvIKw9z8)

1001,"&gt;because more distant objects are more red shifted than closer objects.

This is true regardless of whether the expansion is accelerating or decelerating. The difference between the two is a bit more subtle, and it arises because it's the light itself that is redshifted by the expansion. Which means that it isn't the expansion rate at the time the light that is emitted that determines the redshift, but rather how that rate evolves through the light;'s journey from source to Earth. That's different for accelerating and decelerating expansion, and so they produce different distance-redshift relations (which are what we end up measuring).

[This](https://i.imgur.com/U9auLoB.png) is what that looks like: the blue curve is for an accelerating universe like ours, and the orange one is for a decelerating universe with no dark energy.",1611944697,astrophysics,nivlark,Astrophysics,Comment,131

1005,"&gt; Another thing to note is that gravity doesnt necessarily make two things move towards each other - if they are already speeding past each other (that is, they are moving at right angles to the direction of the gravitational force between them), they won't directly move inwards and hit each other - instead, the gravitational force between them will cause them to curve around each other. This is what causes the Moon to orbit around the Earth, or planets to orbit the Sun, or the Sun to orbit the centre of the Galaxy.

Very interesting.. this makes sense and puts a much clearer image in my head.

&gt; In this way, the nebula can collapse under gravity, getting denser and denser.

Can you explain what exactly happens when a nebula ""collapses""? The gravity that pulls the particles inward working against the attraction particles have to each other that push outwards?

1014,"Professional astronomer here (&gt;20 years after my PhD - urgh, I'm getting old...).

From your use of a 2:1 I assume you're in the UK?  In general, you know whether you like to do astronomy or not after having done some research in astronomy. So if you are in a research based master's where you have to do a half year or so research thesis, this is the time when you're going to see whether you like doing astronomy or not. I know that this sounds a bit like a stereotype, but doing a PhD requires lots of stamina and hard work, and if you don't like it, it's difficult. If you like it, it's the best thing ever. I wanted to be an astrophysicists from age 7 or so, and I've been around for quite some time now, and I am still happy that I get paid for my hobby (well, and for university committee work and administration...).

Concerning the grades: As others have also said, there is a real disconnect between the grades that you get from course work and your ability to research. They are so different skills that when I evaluate applications for a PhD I don't even bother to look at the transcripts (even though they matter for some stipends).

In other words: try to do real astrophysics research, either through your master's thesis work, or through internships, or research projects with professors in your department and so on. Typically, we're all drowning in data, and if you're not afraid of computers, somebody will probably have some data or other project where they need help. Don't be afraid to ask people, normally astronomers are nice and enjoy talking about their work!

1016,"Hi! I'm a professional astronomer, 10 years after my PhD. Those are very pertinent questions! First of all, feeling that you're not good enough compared to your peers --the so-called impostor syndrome-- is extremely common among researchers. I went through it, and it still hits me sometimes. Pretty much everyone I've worked with has had a similar experience. Whenever you feel this way think about this: ""I can't simultaneously be more stupid than my peers and also so clever that I'm fooling them"" :-)

Regarding admission to PhD programs, this varies a lot from country to country, and among universities. Grades are a terrible proxy for how you'll do later on as a researcher. Alas, many institutions still use them to sort out admissions, but fortunately others are abandoning that practice. If you can get some hands-on research experience during your masters, that'll be way more valuable when applying for a PhD. Publications are a plus, but I find it crazy to demand publications from applicants so early on; certainly not as undergrads, MSc would be fine.

An important piece of advice before entering a PhD program is to research how the academic life is in that place. Talk to current and past students/postdocs, ask them about their experience. You're gonna spend several intense years there, so you want to make sure there's a positive atmosphere and a nurturing and supportive academic culture.

As a last piece of advice, you don't need to have your future career path completely figured out, as your calling might change with time. I've worked on research, astronomical instrumentation, and now science communication. There's not a predefined path that you have to stick to!

1110,"**[Superposition principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition principle)**

The superposition principle, also known as superposition property, states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. So that if input A produces response X and input B produces response Y then input (A + B) produces response (X + Y). A function             F     (     x     )         {\displaystyle F(x)}  that satisfies the superposition principle is called a linear function. Superposition can be defined by two simpler properties; additivity and homogeneity              F     (          x            1               +          x            2               )     =     F     (          x            1               )     +     F     (          x            2               )             {\displaystyle F(x_{1}+x_{2})=F(x_{1})+F(x_{2})\,}  Additivity            F     (     a     x     )     =     a     F     (     x     )             {\displaystyle F(ax)=aF(x)\,}  Homogeneityfor scalar a.This principle has many applications in physics and engineering because many physical systems can be modeled as linear systems.

&gt;Since astronomers know that the Universe is expanding, what’s it expanding into? What’s outside of the Universe?” Ask any astronomer and you’ll get an unsatisfying answer. We give you the same unsatisfying answer, but really explain it, so your unsatisfaction doesn’t haunt you any more.

And here comes String Theory:

&gt;In ekpyrotic cosmology — which was proposed in 2001 by physicists Paul Steinhardt, Justin Khoury, Neil Turok and Burt Ovrut — there is no beginning of time. Instead, our visible universe exists on one of two four-dimensional “branes” floating in a five-dimensional space. These two branes are locked in an endless oscillatory motion in which they creep together, “bounce” through each other, withdraw and then creep together again. At each bounce, which is like a fresh Big Bang, ripples in the branes collide and liberate energy at different places to produce the initial density perturbations. And because energy conservation would favour a flat brane, the theory explains why our visible universe is flat too. “It’s like the antichrist to inflation,” says Khoury.

1. Why does E=MC2 mean that travelling at lightspeed is impossible for us? I get that the closer to lightspeed an object gets, the larger mass it will have and the more energy that would require to move it. But I don't understand why it would be impossible. In the book Stephen states that the mass would increase infinitely and would require an infinite amount of energy to attain light speed, but I don't understand where this infinity came from since lightspeed, mass and energy all are quantifiable. So perhaps someone could explain that to me.
2. In addition to that, he stated multiple times that nothing can move faster than light. Is that a fact or is it just that we are not aware of anything that can move FTL?
3. Although this isn't really a question about the book, but a thought that stemmed from reading the book. Why is light used as a measurement of time? Wouldn't movement be more fundamental to our perception of time? I don't think time could exist without movement, but I imagine time could exist without light. Just curious.

That's about as far as I got in the book though haha. Loving the read so far, it's really got me thinking. I'm 23 working in a factory at night shift and this book is keeping me awake.

IMO: In an infinite universe, all outcomes are infinite, also there is no start or end - it just is, our little mote of it is just somewhere on the loop, or in the soup of infinity. I do think dark matter is a piece that may show how infinity works, or the infinite universe. 

I think the universe exists on many planes (I know ""planes"" isnt the right word, as I do not mean a dimensional ""thing"" - more like a ball of jello that folds in and out of itself forever)- not dimensions, just something that is in an infinite space, and goes through these existences thru black holes. the other side of a black hole here is dark matter, and dark matter in our universe has come here thru a black hole somewhere else. when enough dark matter shows up, and enough real matter passes thru a black hole, there is that ""bang"" and a new version of a universe is formed to go thru the whole process forever. (it would look like pouring a jar of jelly in a colander and watching it ooze thru the holes, and then blowing up and rather than back thru the holes in the colander, the colander is inverted and all the jelly is now held in it again to ooze thru, over and over) 

since we deal w infinity I dont think anything will necessarily ever be the same, like there wont be a ""new "" version of earth and me etc. I dont even necessarily think the ""laws of physics"" would even be the same in a new universe. Like the vibrations of color - where we can only see a a tiny bit of that spectrum, maybe all we can ""see"" of physics is all we can see w the senses/ brains we now have.

1145,"Based on current cosmological models, our universe will not re-collapse but rather continue expanding outward forever. This is because the critical density of our universe can't generate a gravitational effect strong enough to halt and reverse expansion (also, dark energy is accelerating expansion).

I think the theory you are referring to is this, although it fails to account for dark energy:

&gt;Some scientists speculated that another Big Bang might follow the crunch, giving rise to a new expansion phase, and then another contraction—perhaps oscillating between successive Big Bangs and big crunches indefinitely in the past and future. Such speculation was sometimes referred to as the oscillating theory of the universe. The challenge for theorists was how to describe the transition from collapse (when space and time themselves disappear into the big crunch) to expansion. With the discovery of dark energy, however, it does not appear that the universe will experience a big crunch, so we can put worrying about it on the back burner.

The Lin–Shu theory introduces the idea of long-lived quasistatic spiral structure (QSSS hypothesis). In this hypothesis, the spiral pattern rotates in a particular angular frequency (pattern speed), whereas the stars in the galactic disk are orbiting at a different speed depending on their distance to the galaxy center.

It may not be the most efficient way to learn about this, as as there are many many topics to study, but I found that after watching those videos for a couple of months I was actually able to understand more and more! I suggest you start there, search for content you're interested in and just dive in! 

Of course at first you'll be confused just like you were with the book, but the visuals, examples and experiments that you can see there will give you a start, and anything you don't understand you can look up online for a quick reference.
I still struggle with a great deal of what they say sometimes, but other times I'm genuinely surprised with my own knowledge, because I've watched/read another source about the topic. 

This area is a very vast, and very complicated, so if you want to pursue an education and career in this, what I say may not be enough, but for me, as an amateur cosmos lover, it really worked!

Also, don't be discouraged by the equations and maths, for the majority of concepts (if concepts in general are what you're interested in) it's not that important. The things that are really vital though will be repeated so many times you won't even notice you know them already! 

I wish you good luck with your journey, it is a very rewarding one :)",1611083854,astrophysics,plinkamalinka,Astrophysics,Comment,283

1151,"Whatever you didn't understand in the book is probably a good place to start! Other than that, it somewhat depends on how formally you want to learn. If you want a very strong understanding, you really can't go wrong with any introductory physics materials, learning the basic concepts like energy, force, momentum, and how (newtonian) gravity and light work. If you want a more ""layman's"" knowledge, I'd honestly just start looking into the words and ideas that you didn't know in the book.

1152,"Firstly we need to clarify what we mean by multiverse and universe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Classification_schemes

Under an inflationary model of the multiverse, it would actually be fair to say that our ""universe"" ends and is separated from other universes by inflating space. Some would potentially argue that these aren't separate universes though because they're only separated by space.

Under brane multiverse, things are a lot more complicated and confusing. This is related to modern string theory and higher dimensions. Because of the addition of extra dimensions, its more complicated than saying that there's stuff outside our universe in this theory, because if you limited yourself to the normal dimensions then there wouldn't be.

1167,"The Big Bang was not an explosion. An explosion happens in a pre-existing space and everything moves away from the source of the explosion. At the beginning our universe was much denser and hotter than it is now, but it is not entirely reasonable to conclude that it was ever infinitely dense. We know that our universe is expanding, but the difficult part to wrap your head around is that the cosmological expansion of the universe does not involve any physical motion like you would have in an explosion. Instead, space itself is expanding, but not into anything, there is just constantly more of it everywhere. Space and time came into existence with our universe, and are not just a stage upon which action happens. Just as there is no specific site where the Big Bang happened (in a very important sense it happened at every location contained in our universe), there is no edge where the constituents of the universe are moving into empty territory. One of the best ways to think about our universe is as ""Finite but unbounded"". Like the surface of a sphere you can travel as far as you want, but you will never come to an edge. This is not some guess that works pretty well, it is the only scenario consistent with observations. If you want to understand modern cosmology you will have to stop looking at the big bang as an explosion. Remember, the term big bang was coined by astronomer Fred Hoyle (an adherent to Steady State theory, an old competitor to Big Bang theory) to make fun of Big Bang theory, not because the term was in any way accurate. Our universe may or may not be infinite (in fact there are better arguments for it being finite), but space and time are likely emergent properties of our universe and are not an absolute stage upon which everything happens (this is the perhaps the most important thing we have learned from General Relativity). Popular level explanations of the Big Bang largely all make the mistake of looking at the Big Bang as an explosion, that is a mistake and if you want to understand the universe you will have to move beyond that idea.",1611061339,astrophysics,chardo137,Astrophysics,Comment,374

As for the first part, it takes whole books to explain these things and I won't pretend it can be done in a reddit post. So I'm giving a high level explanation that hides a lot of detail in  jargon. These are the things you should have to read up on, but generally to understand phonons you need to have done a semester of quantum mechanics and then one on solid state physics. Statistical mechanics / thermal physics is yet another full semester. So that's a lot of stuff to pack into one comment. 

&gt;So am I understanding correctly if I state that, because of the expansion, energy is slowly dissipating?


Yes.

Just one more thing, let's take all of those with a grain of salt. While I certainly cannot comprehend size of the universe - I even less can comprehend, how the hell sentience occured, let alone basic life. So there was a glowing rock, which was randomly bombarded with rocks, then supposedly bombarded with meteors with water, and just then, out of those... materials and elements, poof there came the first microbe. And over much much time, eventually, that tiny spec of barely something, came to be me... Yeah right. Yes I know it's obviously not how it exactly happened (by theory) but to keep it short and still be on point.  
This is just something that is quite literally unbelieveable for me, thus I'm rather of a we-live-in-a-simulation type of guy. And for me, it's 50%-50% if any other sentient being exists, or doesn't, in this universe.  
But as it can be noticed, i like these discussions and always looking for proof and healthy intake of knowledge and facts.

Finally, let me address those thoughts. Let's even refine and put into perspective some of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Universe is almost 14 billion years old.  
There is evidence that suggests life began as early as 4.5 billion years ago.  
The Milky Way contains at least one planet per star, resulting in 100–400 billion planets.  
Based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy.

I dare say, everything considered, we actually are pretty old. Our development began slightly less than a third of total age of the universe!

So, let's say we have 400 billion planets, and 40 billion of those are potentially habitable.  
Now say 10% of them, actually are (habitable), that would be around four billion.  
Now say 10% of those, do have life, which would be four hundred million.  
Now say 10% of those, have intelligent life - that would come down to forty million.  
Now say 10% of those, are capable of understanding serious space stuff and want or need to explore - in essence, capable of spacefaring - totals at four million.  
Now say 10% of them, survived all kinds of mass extintion events, asteroids, nuclear wars or what have you - four hundred thousand.

Now all the people, scientists, everybody - lives in misconception that aliens would 100% want to own everything, and destroy/harvest all the energy there is.

However, let's say that out of that 400,000 - 10% are dirty capitalistic industrialists that want to take over the universe. That gets us to the number of only fourty thousand.  
Let's say 10% of those actually succeed - since willingness and capabilities are not the same - four thousand.  
Let's say 10% actually do it on a such a scale that would be noticable, in such a way we could recognize (e.g Dyson sphere), harvesting multiple star systems and doing it quickly - just four hundred.  
And for the last, let's say 10% survive for long enough in general, as species, while not deciding to go into virtual reality, simulation, don't get enlightened, eaten by it's own AI for example etc... - that's, then... just fourty (40) races, in total.

These are some basic, nonchalant filters I've put here.  
But still, quite a number eh?  
Well... I think that I gave more than generous chances here.  
Hell, if I had 10% chance to win lottery, i'd play it every single day, right!? And I believe life is much less probable than winning lottery.

So let's say just 1% of this, is realistic number.

That, by simple math, leads us to the answer that probability of life, in whole 53 light years wide, Milky Way galaxy, chance of life is... 0.4%. Which is still extremely high, although I feel it's just a chance of probability of something happening, not 0.4% of actual success.  
So I'd boldly say that in just 1% of cases, all of these filters actually go as planned with nothing else applied. Then number of spacefaring life in the universe is just 0.004%.

Let's also not forget to mention that scientists are saying regarding the actual size:  
""They found that the universe is at least 250 times larger than the observable universe, or at least 7 trillion light-years across.""

I understand this is layman logic, but it is a plausible logic nonetheless.

We truly might be looking for a needle in a haystack.

1191,"&gt;Heat is needed for things to happen. On absolute zero, nothing can, for many reasons, but you probably know that much better than I do.

So, this is wrong in several ways. 

Basically any ordinary quantum mechanics is 0k and clearly it's not true that nothing happens here (this describes atoms, or describes bonds between atoms / harmonic oscillators and a ton of other things). once you add temperature (you're talking about heat, but heat is only a way of transferring energy and not something a system has ) and do statistical mechanics you get thermal population of states on top of basic qm. Higher energy states than the ground state  are populated (there's always some portion of atoms in excited states, just because the temperature is nonzero) . Looking at the harmonic oscillator even in the ground state you have motion. see [this link](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Pacific_Union_College/Quantum_Chemistry/05%3A_The_Harmonic_Oscillator_and_the_Rigid_Rotor/5.04%3A_The_Harmonic_Oscillator_Energy_Levels). similarly an electron in the  ground state of a hydrogen atom.

&gt;A **phonon** is a collective vibration of several atoms [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon)

A phonon is a quantized lattice vibration in a solid. It's basically a (quantized) sound wave in a crystalline solid. Even if you didn't have phonons at 0k (you do have positive energy in the ground state because this is exactly also modeled as the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator i mentioned in the earlier paragraph) that wouldn't mean nothing happens. Phonons are a very high level thing and say nothing about even more low level systems. 

&gt;I don't understand this.  
&gt; **When the space through which particles move is changing, the total energy of those particles is not conserved.**   
&gt;How can space change for matter?

In general relativity the metric (the gravitating field) describes the geometry of spacetime and it's a dynamic field (it can change over time). in short this is what happens in cosmology and you have an expanding spacetime. The spacetime around a nonrotating  black hole  is actually static and not changing with time. This is more about spacetime on the large, cosmological scale, not black holes, anyway. 

&gt; Does this speak about anti-matter?

There's no distinction between how that affects matter or anti matter here.",1611019876,astrophysics,lettuce_field_theory,Astrophysics,Comment,392
1192,"**[Molecular vibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular vibration)**

A molecular vibration is a periodic motion of the atoms of a molecule relative to each other, such that the center of mass of the molecule remains unchanged. The typical vibrational frequencies range from less than 1013 Hz to approximately 1014 Hz, corresponding to wavenumbers of approximately 300 to 3000 cm−1. Vibrations of polyatomic molecules are described in terms of normal modes, which are independent of each other, but each normal mode involves simultaneous vibrations of different parts of the molecule. In general, a non-linear molecule with N atoms has 3N – 6 normal modes of vibration, but a linear molecule has 3N – 5 modes, because rotation about the molecular axis cannot be observed.

Sorry both links are from Wikipedia, I do know that's not the most reliable source, but my knowledge or tell-tales aren't either, so I'd rather quote something tangible than post a 20-minute video.

From my understanding, everything is vibrating, and once it stops, there's nothing that can happen anymore, since no energy/information can be transferred. There's a decent video PBS Spacetime created on the topic, but I'm having hard time finding it. If you're genuinely interested, I will (find it), I think it's from 2018.

I don't understand this.  
 **When the space through which particles move is changing, the total energy of those particles is not conserved.**   
How can space change for matter? Does this speak about anti-matter? Or what happens to regular matter particles when they fly by dark energy...? I just don't get it.  
Since, if we take drastic changes in space(time), as around black holes, energy is not (not) conserved, but rather transferred if anything. Or so I think.

You're not required to give me an explanation, of course.  
As said in our previous encounter, I'm just a regular dude with regular job living regular life, not scientist by any means. Just very much interested into space and stuff in free time, and since science offers much better explanations than Bible... There I am.

 I understand why the idea doesn't work and I was never suggesting that my idea was right or true - I was just interested in it and wanted to discuss.

What do you mean vibrate anyway? Yes heat death means the universe cools down, to some even lower nonzero temperature. Even at 0k the atoms are in their ground state and still do what you would probably call ""vibrate"".

&gt;thus nothing can ever happen

No. Most microscopic processes still happen. Particles flying around, interacting.

&gt;If energy can't be created nor destroyed, just transferred from one state to another, how is heat death possible?

Energy is not conserved in cosmology and the universe has been expanding and cooling down all the time. Actually the amount of dark energy in the universe has increased though. See here

1206,"&gt;What if we are actually observing (and existing in) the interior of a Black Hole and the expanding universe is actually just more of our universe being pulled in to the Black Hole that sucked us in

Short answer: No. The universe is nothing like a black hole. See

https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/04/28/the-universe-is-not-a-black-hole/

&gt;The Universe is constantly expanding at a constant rate (the speed of light), 

This is wrong. The rate of expansion is not a speed (distance / time) at all, it's a .. rate (1 / time) and the rate is NOT constant. Expansion is accelerating (rate increasing).

They are asking about andromeda though and expansion is irrelevant here. Also they are asking about gravitational redshift specifically (not cosmological). Though the more relevant type of redshift in that example is that from peculiar motion (and is actually a blueshift for light emitted in andromeda received in our galaxy as the two are moving twoards each other).

&gt;Photons do not lose energy when travelling through space unless they collide with something else so none of the redshift is caused by the light losing energy.

1213,"The problem is that it's a huge expense for something that is pretty unlikely to produce any real results. It's also a bit of a zero-sum game. You're taking millions of dollars away from surveys that produce actual results, to set up a survey that has a really big chance of finding absolutely nothing at all.

It's also not really all that necessary to have dedicated surveys, because we are already doing lots of big multi-purpose surveys in all sorts of wavelengths, and you can easily piggyback SETI research onto those. We have loads of surveys mapping huge numbers of stars that have been used to look for dyson spheres etc. We have surveys looking at variable stars and near-earth-objects that would also catch signals for alien life. We have surveys of transiting planets that look carefully at atmospheric spectra to look for life signs. Like, we're already doing a bunch of this stuff, and there's not a great deal more we can do without huge risk and expense.

A plan to catch something like 'Oumuamua would be good though. That's an example of a good mission, because it's not really a SETI mission - it's a mission to investigate an unusual object that's interesting regardless of its origin. It can tell us a lot about the chemical evolution of the universe, and the nature of these interstellar travellers. It's also important for the long-term security of the Earth, because identifying and intercepting near-earth objects could prevent a future extinction event. It'd also be an important advance in terms of space-flight and mission planning, and could be a step towards things like asteroid mining missions.

Mirrors make more sense. But the are of a sphere where they could operate for a long time is - quite literally - astronomical.

To cover this, let's say with only limited coverage at 2mm average thickness of the devices, you'd need perhaps 800 billion tons of space craft to fill 1% of the sphere at 2/3rds of Mercury's Semimajor Axis.

1218,"A few others have touched on this point, but you need to remember how old the universe is, and how old Earth is, and how many other stars there are even in our own galaxy.

Your idea supposes that all civilisations started at the same time - but there is no known reason that they would.

The universe is nearly 13 thousand *million* years old, and the Earth is four and a half thousand million years old. Evolution is a roll of the dice - the dinosaurs had everything they needed to evolve an intelligent, spacefaring civilisation 100 million years ago, but as far as we know, they didn't.

Other planets might have reached the point where a species could gain enough intelligence to take to the stars billions of years ago. If they had the same evolutionary drive to propagate and colonise as we do (a strong likelihood, given the advantages that behaviour confers), then there should be some evidence of large scale colonisation.

This is where the concept of The Great Filter comes from. What it boils down to is a list of theorised reasons why we don't see techno-signatures everywhere we look.

Maybe advanced civilisations hide themselves or get destroyed. Maybe an advanced civilisation inevitably destroys *itself*. Maybe there's something in our own evolutionary past that almost all species don't survive - maybe there's something in our future like that. 

Or... Maybe, as you imply, there was something unknown about the universe that prevented intelligent civilisations from starting until the last few hundred thousand years, and we're among the first to get going - if so, we should gradually start detecting more and more techno-signatures over the next few hundred million years - by which time we will hopefully have spread throughout at least our own galaxy.

So if a mountain is billions of years old would we be able to measure the age of the rocks from that mountain (comparing top to bottom) and notice time dilation effects in the age of the rocks?

In other words in a case like that, I think your argument says that although the time dilation differential is tiny between the top and bottom of the mountain, given vast cosmic time (billions of years) maybe it adds up and becomes noticeable?

---------------

As such I would venture to guess that it would still not even be detectable especially with current measurement techniques.. and similarly the effects you mention would still not be highly significant even at intergalactic scales over vast amounts of time (billions of years)... I think!?

1256,"Since astrophysics is already in the midst of a data revolution, I think AI and machine learning will optimize and refine image analysis of astrophysical data (they already have been doing so). 

As someone mentioned below, astronomy is a discipline with physical restrictions, so one major goal for astronomers is to further increase the sensitivity, resolution, and range of instrumentation, as well as the pace at which photos are analyzed. Several projects (more powerful and penetrative observatories and probes) are currently underway to improve the quality of data;  many of these projects will employ deep learning models that can quantitatively characterize astronomical objects at a scale, rate, and level of detail unachievable by crude human senses. This is particularly important because one major issue in astrophysics is marshalling enough support to classify data at a speed that matches/exceeds the rate at which photos are taken. 

Ideally, machine learning programs will be able to glean information at the pixel-level from several different photos at the same time (a very challenging task) and efficiently classify the objects being observed (brightness, morphology, ellipticity, color, etc).

[Linked here is a discussion that delves into AI in image analysis](https://developer.nvidia.com/gtc/2019/video/S9508), although you will have to make an account on the website to watch it. One of the mentioned telescopes, the JWST, is planned to view galaxies that were formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang - an unprecedented improvement in sensitivity and resolution for sure.

I also believe that the [WLCG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj8ZNgnzSSU) (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid), a project at CERN that distributes cloud computing power and resources across the globe, will also become widely used in astrophysics in the future. The idea behind this development is to provide worldwide storage, analysis, reconstruction, etc for the sheer amount of data produced at the LHC. Because large quantities of data are also produced in astrophysics, I think networks dedicated to global, real-time processing/storage of astronomical data will be created.

1265,"Well, compared to the mass of the rest of the universe, a single galaxy on its own is shockingly pretty insignificant! 

But most of all: a galaxy is highly diffuse on average, consisting of mostly ""nothing"" rather than ""something"" (in terms of everyday matter at least). 

So on the whole, galaxies can not generate any significant time dilation effects, given their mass-density (in which they are just simply whispy clouds of mostly nothing). 

--------------------------------

To give another example: 

A black hole generates insane amounts of time dilation due to mass. 

But a stellar mass black hole is just that: about the mass of a star (even less). 

So the reason the mass of the black hole can generate time dilation is due to concentration (density). 

But if you took the mass of a black hole and spread it out, then no more significant time dilation!

 *the big bang is not something you can hear* *-* 'hear' is probably the wrong word but I believe something has been observed which supports the theory

 *a black hole is characterized by a spatial singularity. There is currently no evidence to support that such a global singularity (which pertains over the lifetime of the Universe, as opposed to a one-time event that was the big bang) exists.* \- This would potentially be a 'black hole' on a scale which we haven't observed before although I guess the 'exit point' which could potentially be observed could be very small relatively speaking.

 *The Universe is defined as ""everything that exists"". How could our universe be enveloped by a second universe? There can be only one Universe.* \- there is no second universe, only a part which we can observe (already passed through the 'black hole') and a part which we can't observe (in the process of being drawn into the 'black hole')

 *why would one side be bigger than the other? What makes a side special?* *-* nothing special about one side or the other - one side has passed through the 'black hole' the other is in the process of being drawn in. Based on the theory we have already passed through - this is why our observable universe is expanding. If we were still on the other side the observable universe would be contracting (as more of the universe passes through to our side). 

 *how did you get to an hourglass shape?* \- This is assuming that the 'black hole' is smaller than the universe itself (which it would have to be because it is essentially contained within it), it would form two cones with the 'black hole' being in the middle at the point of both cones.

 *Every galaxy too far away for gravity to affect them is moving away from every other Galaxy because the space between them is literally expanding. -* This is how we would see and interpret everything now but essentially everything would just be moving to the position it had been in in relation to everything else on the other side of the 'Black Hole' (before being sucked in).

The Hubble constant tells you the current rate of change of the scale factor of the universe, which is just a way to express the expansion, compared to the current value of the scale factor: (current change of scale) / (current scale).

Similarly if we measure this at a wavelength shorter than 656 nm then it is blue shifted.

From these measurements we can determine a value called _z_, the red(blue)shift value calculated as

The transitions are named sequentially by Greek letters: from n = 2 to n = 1 is called Lyman-alpha, 3 to 1 is Lyman-beta, 4 to 1 is Lyman-gamma, and so on.

1335,"Quantum mechanics teaches us that electrons that are bound to an atom (or molecule) can **only emit or absorb certain distinct energies**, based on their current energetic state and based on the properties of the individual atom or molecule.

This means that in the rest frame (lab frame), where we don't need to think about Doppler shifts of light (which is very different from the cosmological redshift...) and such things, the energy of a given transition, e.g. the recombination of a hydrogen nucleus and an electron, which emits a photon, will always emit a photon of the same energy.

Now an electron can occupy many different energy states when it's bound to a nucleus. Given the right circumstances, it can change between and every of these states by emitting or absorbing photons. However, every transition between any two states will have a distinct energy required, or energy emitted. Because this energy is distinct, we also commonly call them ""**lines""**, since on a spectrum of electromagnetic waves, you would see these energy levels as such - as lines. For example, the famous ""[Lyman Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_series)"" are all the possible lines that a transition from any state of the electron of a Hydrogen atom to the lowest possible  electron level. 

If the atoms are emitting a certain line in the spectrum, you would see it as an overshoot at the given wavelength/frequency of the light. (Remember, frequency and the inverse of the wavelength are directly proportional to the photon's energy.) Such a line is called an ""emission line"".

On the other hand, if the atoms you're looking at are absorbing photons, you could see so called ""absorption lines"", [(e.g. like this)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1095/2016/11/03155051/OSC_Astro_05_05_TSpectra.jpg) i.e. there would be energy missing in the spectrum that you're looking at. When we look at other galaxies, most of the time we are looking at absorption lines.

The main points here concerning your question are the following:

\- If an interaction occurs where the atom would absorb or emit light, we could observe the interaction's effect on the electromagnetic spectrum as absorption or emission lines.

\- each atom doesn't have only one line, but a whole collection of absorption or emission lines. 

\- those lines always have a distinct energy / wavelength / frequency in the rest frame.

\- if there is a Doppler shift or a cosmological shift, it would move the position of the lines in the spectrum to higher or lower values. In case of the cosmological redshift, the light always looses energy (goes towards the red part of the electromagnetic spectrum). The shift is not arbitrary, but moves **the entire spectrum** by a factor z.

\- Now recall that atoms have distinct absorption and emission lines. This means what we can measure is not only one line, but a lot of them on the spectrum. And because they are at distinct energies / wavelengths / frequencies, **the difference in energy / wavelength / frequency also have distinct values and also get shifted.** See e.g. [this image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Tfv0BnLr6xPvck_JC9ndyr7wBwieW7H08pEGK4fIb2FrFFr2Q5OO6EoPceAxIhCLIVzN64igSrcd-2n7Owvm5j4sasjvKXqj4YpMehoC-YMV3O-UWQQxSsZMjW2MCA). One can clearly see that the line distribution on the spectrum have their own signature.

\- Using the differences in energy/wavelength/frequency, we can now identify by how much it got shifted, because the differences are quite recogniseable, even if they all get shifted by some factor.",1610598592,astrophysics,AthenasLilOwl,Astrophysics,Comment,546

1339,"&gt;Using the Andromeda galaxy for an example, when light first leaves the galaxy, it has X energy and a corresponding wavelength. Does the light have a lower energy and therefore appear redder when it reaches Earth?

The cosmological principle is almost purely empirical; the basis for which are the observations made of the CBM. The isotropic and homogeneous-ness of the universe is observed at these larger scales through the CBM which provides the evidence for the cosmological principle. 

Now, there have been a few known inconsistencies between observations of galaxy clusters and this homogeny. However, these are generally considered to fall within the error bars (so to speak) of the cosmological principle. 

Given that the principle can not be confirmed through math, it is very important for our observations to be interpreted correctly.

1.24E22 kg is far less than 0.21 times the mass of Earth. And its *satellite* has more mass? Should that be 1.24E24 kg?

There is a lot of freedom to choose all these parameters, but keep the average density in a reasonable range and calculate the periods based on the orbital data.

1409,"All time: Fritz Zwicky. He was the first person to notice Dark Matter, long before anyone else. No one would take him seriously, and because of that he was fond of saying that his colleagues were ""Spherical Bastards"" because no matter how you looked at it... He also had some of the more interesting portraits in the history of science taken of him. LOL I was on a thread discussing Dark Matter several years ago now and I brought this up. I got a response from a woman who was a descendant of his, and she wanted to make sure that everyone knew that he was mostly kidding and that he never harbored any ill will towards anyone and was very well liked by all. And finally, he invented the word ""Supernova"", if that doesn't deserve some respect I don't know what does.

Currently: Sean Carroll. I really like listening to him explain things. Not only is he a top notch scientist, he spends a lot of time bringing his discoveries to the masses and refuses to dumb them down like so many do. I have followed Sean and read his books since they have been coming out, but I recently watched his Great Courses video series ""Dark Matter, Dark Energy—The Dark Side of the Universe"" from The Teaching Company and it is perhaps the best introduction to Cosmology and Astrophysics that I have ever come across. His Mindscape podcast is very good and he has a lot of interesting people on it, plus he is one of the best interviewers that I have ever listened to. I really like the story he tells about having Richard Feynman's old desk at Cal Tech. He says that while it seems like a really great honor, what it really means is that he is the most senior person in his department that is not senior enough to deserve a brand new desk. LOL

Honorable mention: Robert Kirshner. He is one of the people involved with the work that went into discovering the accelerating expansion of the universe. But more importantly to me he wrote me a letter when he was a physics student and was given the probably not greatly looked forward to task of explaining to an 11 year old why his new theory of Quasars, which had been mailed in to Cal Tech, was flawed. He was very encouraging and sent me photocopies of several articles about the then emerging consensus that Quasars were active galactic nuclei from sources that I never could have accessed as a pre-teen in a small town.

1441,"The heat inside planets comes from 3 main sources. One is called accretion. This means that when things smacked together to make the planet, some of that energy of collision released heat. This is no longer making NEW heat so much (except when a meteor or asteroid strikes, which is now rare but common in the early solar system.) Another source of heat is called differentiation. The heavier material sunk down to the core (which has a lot of iron and nickel) and lighter stuff ended up on the surface. That friction of motion caused some heat, but again, it happens less now. Finally, there is radioactivity. Supernovas, exploding stars that sent elements throughout space to form solar systems like ours, put some of their energy into the formation of radioactive elements (or isotope). Then they've been releasing that energy as the radioactive elements break apart. But every radioactive element has a ""half life"", time before half of the material breaks apart, and after it releases its energy it usually becomes a normal non-radioactive element. So this source of heat is also slowly running out.

The heat made inside a planet comes to the surface through convection and then conduction. When that heat reaches the surface it escapes into space through radiation.

So this can't last forever. Heat escapes the planet and the new ways to make heat (mostly radioactivity) become weaker over time.",1610256501,astrophysics,Schmucko,Astrophysics,Comment,234

No, I don't mean that anything specific needs to be taken with a grain of salt, just that it's silly to think we can say \*anything\* with a signficant certainty about something happening, say, even a billion years from now.

For example, it is still well within conceiveable possibility that we've gotten something wrong about stellar evolution, f.e., and that saying anything more about the fate of the Sun than ""it'll probably be a white dwarf before ten billion years have passed"" might turn out to be ""inaccurate"".

OK?  Physics is about building models, representations about the physical world, or parts of it.  From the models, we can deduce some characteristics about the targets of our interest.  This can be fantastically accurate (as it is with f.e. atoms and molecules or elementary particles in laboratory conditions), or ""a little more than justifiable guess"" -- as it is with trying to say anything at all about an era 10\^10\^32 years from now.

HOWEVER, astronauts in the Space Station are actually only a few hundred km from the surface (and the Earth's radius is 6357 km).

  
Why are astronauts weightless then? Because they are falling! Being in orbit is the same as falling. Think about it, what does it mean to fall? It means the ONLY force acting on you is gravity. You feel less weight in an elevator going down, and if god forbid the elevator cord were cut and you'd fall, you'd be totally weightless.

All things fall together. That's what Galileo showed at the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Very precise experiments starting with this guy Eotvos showed gravity's acceleration doesn't depend on what it is being pulled--plastic, styrofoam, wood, spam, they all fall the same (if gravity's the only force). So when you're in orbit, gravity is the only force acting on you, and it's pulling you INTO that circular orbit (or else you'd go in a straight line flying to escape the Earth, nice try!) But it's pulling everything the same. You spill some water, and yes, gravity's keeping it orbiting along with you, so it floats.

Now, things may float around slightly differently, but that's only because they started with slightly different forces on them to begin with, or because of air, etc.

That everything falls the same is called the Equivalence Principle and was the basis of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in which gravity is actually the curvature of space and time, not a mutual thing between puller and pullee.",1609996971,astrophysics,Schmucko,Astrophysics,Comment,282

Something is in orbit means that it is continuously falling, towards the center of the orbit. However, since it also has a velocity perpendicular to that direction, it is constantly missing the center. 

Let a rock drop from your hand, and it falls straight towards the center of the earth. Throw it horizontally and it is still falling towards the center, but it takes a longer route until it hits ground. Throw it fast enough and it will eventually go past the curvature of earth and completely miss the ground. Then it is in orbit.

Astronauts appear floating since they, as well as the ship they are on, are both falling at the same rate towards earth. There is no relative acceleration between the two. Both the astronaut and the ship is in orbit around the earth.",1609996828,astrophysics,MrMakeItAllUp,Astrophysics,Comment,155

They are too close to earth, they would get sucked up by its gravity. Now here comes the most confusing thing to understand: The ISS and the astronauts on it are constantly in a free fall. Zero G= free fall. One trick is movement and the speed of the ISS around the planet.There are zero G flights as well, and maybe it's easier to understand what is happening with them as an example. They fly up and down in parabolic curves, and as soon as that turning point in the curve comes, people in that plane can float for a few seconds because they are free falling constantly towards earth's curvature.

The heaviest element that is going to be produced through stellar nucleosynthesis is Iron. Full stop. Once the star reaches this Iron core stage the nuclear fusion stops completely and then the strength of gravity wins against the outward pressure created through the nuclear fusion process and the star collapses going to supernova. The resulting supernova could indeed create heavier elements, but I don't believe this is the same process that is occuring in the star when it's creating its fusion byproducts (Think it's neutron capture but I am not certain of that)

Also same goes for our own sun, there are no gold atoms present in our sun because to do so would require the fusion of elements heavier than Iron, which per the laws of stellar fusion is not ever going to happen.

Not really.

&gt;As far as something from nothing, remember that quantum fluctuations are just that. One of the leading ideas about the very beginning of the universe is that it began with a quantum fluctuation.

The term quantum fluctuation is heavily misused. They usually refer to corrections to classical effects that you get from a quantum treatment but they aren't quantities changing over time, spontaneously or something like that. This is a very popscience idea of quantum fluctuation.

1573,"&gt;I think we have all the evidence that the universe is expanding, but this isn’t what I’m questioning. Rather, there seems to be consensus in the astrophysics and general scientific community that the universe has a beginning. To me, it seems far more logical to assume the universe has always existed. 

Not really, there's a consensus that the evolution of the universe from is describe by the big bang: the universe started hot and dense, then expanded and cooled. There is a consensus that the phase before that needs new physics (because of the high energies involved and current theories we have not being reliable there). It's open what happened then, in that I agree with your sentiment.

This is wrong. We know the opposite. Matter is being created all the time in every quantum field theory / particle physics process and energy is not conserved in the cosmological context.

1586,"**A Universe from Nothing Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing** by Lawrence M. Krauss


&gt;Bestselling author and acclaimed physicist Lawrence Krauss offers a paradigm-shifting view of how everything that exists came to be in the first place. “Where did the universe come from? What was there before it? What will the future bring? And finally, why is there something rather than nothing?” One of the few prominent scientists today to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss describes the staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories that demonstrate not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. With a new preface about the significance of the discovery of the Higgs particle, A Universe from Nothing uses Krauss’s characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations to take us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications for how it’s going to end. Provocative, challenging, and delightfully readable, this is a game-changing look at the most basic underpinning of existence and a powerful antidote to outmoded philosophical, religious, and scientific thinking.

Well, no one likes it, but the concept here is called ""Quantum fluctuations"" or ""Energy fluctuations"" and it generates ""virtual particles"". Energy seemingly out of nowhere.

&gt;Quantum electrodynamics was one of the first quantum approaches to a quantum field theory, so it introduced many features possessed by string theory (which is also a quantum field theory). In quantum electrodynamics, *virtual particles* can exist briefly, arising from the energy fluctuations of the quantum fields that exist at every point in space.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some virtual particles — such as the photon in the figure — exist just long enough to communicate information about a force. Other virtual particles spring into existence, seemingly for no purpose other than to make the lives of physicists more interesting.

1588,"Space and time seem to be emergent properties brought about by the interactions of the various constituents of the universe. We have two main branches of how we define the physical laws of our universe. First there is quantum mechanics which defines an unchanging space-time metric upon which all of the action happens and space and time are considered fundamental constituents of the universe. Then we have general relativity that makes space and time dynamic and their metric is defined by the mass-energy of the universe and it changes with time and motion. Quantum mechanics is therefore ""Background dependent"" and General Relativity is ""Background independent"". The fact that space-time is background independent is the main point of general relativity and strongly suggests that space and time are relational, or emergent, properties of the universe and not fundamental entities in their own right. As far as something from nothing, remember that quantum fluctuations are just that. One of the leading ideas about the very beginning of the universe is that it began with a quantum fluctuation. The philosophical idea of nothing may not be mirrored in reality. The universe exists, and we can conceive the idea that it might not exist, but the obvious fact of its existence might be all there is. No one has come up with a convincing argument that says non-existence is a possible fundamental or natural property that a universe could have. It could be another example of humans trying to interpret their universe with intuition that is not particularly well suited to the questions at hand. It is also worth thinking about the idea that, because gravitational energy is negative, the sum total energy density of our universe may be exactly equal to zero (based on this concept Alan Guth, who invented the idea of inflation, calls the universe ""the ultimate free lunch""). It is also worth remembering that particle pairs of matter and anti-matter can be created without violating any conservation principles. With the creation of the pair the universe obviously seems to have more ""Stuff"" in it, but according to the laws of physics the +1 and -1 that we use to enumerate the particles add up to zero so physics says there is the same amount of stuff with or without the new particle pair. Human intuition is not terribly reliable in understanding the universe as a whole, on either very large or very small scales. That is why cosmology is hard. We have to do the math and trust where it leads us even if it contradicts traditional ideas about how nature functions. The book ""A Universe From Nothing"" by Lawrence Kraus discusses the possibility that our universe began with a quantum fluctuation. I believe that you would like the ""Before the Big Bang"" series by skydivephil on youtube. It addresses these concepts thoroughly and has interviews with the majority of the important cosmologists working in the field today.

1589,"Yep, that's pretty much right. Absorption changes the intensity of certain wavelengths, and it occurs when light reflects off celestial objects or passes through gas and dust. There's not much of either between the Sun and Earth, and what is there is compositionally similar to the Sun itself (the solar wind) so it wouldn't really change the spectrum emitted by the Sun.

The EMPIRE data could be used to get a measured spectrum of the Sun at a point in time, but if you're interested in making idealized calculations you could look at [Planck's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law?wprov=sfla1). That equation will let you construct a simulated spectral curve for a star of a certain temperature at each wavelength/frequency. That could be pretty easily automated and represented in a spectrogram! It will not account for any absorption though. However, after generating the initial curve you could manipulate your dataset to simulate absorption along the path?

A universe simulation could be helpful depending on what you wanted to do, but it's likely more general than you would need and probably focuses on particle interactions. It would really depend on the simulation details.",1609706766,astrophysics,ice-nein,Astrophysics,Comment,187

The Big Bang is a best fit model, but it does break down eventually.

What comes before the Big Bang, I think there are some ideas floating around, but there is no evidence to substantiate them (to my knowledge).

I think the important thing to consider here is what we can question (not what is allowed to be asked, but what we can ask that we can actually pursue an answer to).

&gt;Sergei Krikalev who came back to Earth 0.02 seconds earlier.

Yeah, this is due to (mostly) gravitational time dilation... He was higher up in the earth's gravitational potential than we are, meaning we experience dilated time with respect to him, so he measures his time in space slightly shorter than we do.

It's important to remember that he was not going anywhere near the speed of light, so it can't really be compared to your other example which is:

&gt;person A who is on Earth’s ground who is “stationary”, and person B who is on a spacecraft flying at say the speed of light for ease. If they both start their stopwatches simultaneously and stop them right as person B returns to Earth

So the most important thing to learn to make relativity make sense is the definition of ""proper time"". This is defined as the time measured by the reference frame where the two events you're measuring the time between occur at the same point in space, which also means it's the reference frame that measures the shortest possible time between two particular events. 

For the sake of clarity I'm going to slightly change the question. Let's say person B starts on the moon, takes off, then travels at a constant velocity *very close but not equal to* the speed of light, before landing on earth. Person A is on earth, and they both start their stopwatch exactly when B takes off and stop them exactly when B lands. Of course, in reality there would be some accelerations involved but let's ignore those for the sake of simplicity.

In this scenario, person A sees B take off on the moon and land on earth, which means in his reference frame, the two events he is measuring the time between occur at different points in space. Therefore, we conclude that A does not measure proper time. In B's reference frame, the stopwatch is started when the moon is *directly beneath him*, then the moon takes off from his spaceship and the earth rushes towards him at an extremely high speed. Then he stops the stopwatch when earth is *directly beneath him*. Both the events in B's reference frame occur *directly beneath him* so we must conclude that B measures proper time. 

So now we know that for these two events, B, by definition, measures the shortest possible time for any reference frame. Therefore, these two events must take longer for A than for B.

This is a common place to get confused because when you learn about proper time, it doesn't sound that important, but if you ignore it you'll definitely go wrong somewhere.

If you want to learn more without doing too much maths it might be worth learning about (spacetime diagrams)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram].

As I sit here at my keyboard I'm not moving in space, but I am moving in time. So for some activity (e.g. from the start to the end of me typing this sentence) my Δx=0 and my Δt=T for some time T.

The alien, seated at their own typewriter, sees me moving at −0.9c, so in between starting and finishing my sentence the alien sees that I have moved some distance Δx=d. But in Special Relativity space and time are linked, so if the alien measures a different Δx they must also measure a different Δt.

The reason they are experiencing different dilations of time is not because of their relative speeds. It’s because of their location relative to a gravitational force, like the earth. 

Space is stretched, and thus also time along with it, by the mass of the earth. 

So when person B flies away from Person A (and earth), it’s not the actual motion that’s changing the dilation of time, it’s their new position relative to gravities effects on the their space time location(s).

Because that would honestly be enough for me to convert... I actually hoped for a way to calculate all of this into some sort of waveform which i could automate to fit every data set, but i guess the info from empire is worth a lot! Thank you so much for the help! :)

Ive seen some videos of a universe sandbox simulation that could do some physical calculations, do you think trying something with it would be worth a shot? I just want to also gather visual material for presentations etc.

1639,"This sounds like a neat project, but I think there's a couple issues that might throw a wrench into your plans. If I'm understanding you correctly, you are aiming to turn the journey of a photon (or photons) from the Sun to Earth into music based on the changes it would go through while travelling through interplanetary space?

Solar physics and the interplanetary medium are not my areas of expertise, but I have worked on similar research with the interstellar medium and extragalactic radio sources. There's a few different ways that light can change while travelling through space, but in the short distance from the Sun to Earth the most prominent one will be absorption by intervening material. Unfortunately, almost all the absorption we detect happens in the Earth's atmosphere, so pretty much all of the changes to the Sun's spectrum occur in the last second of the journey. You can see these changes on [this plot](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_spectrum_en.svg). The yellow plot is the solar spectrum before entering the atmosphere and the red plot is the spectrum after travelling through the atmosphere. The absorption is wavelength specific and depends on the composition of the intervening material, in this case the atmosphere. As far as I'm aware (and someone please correct me if I'm wrong) there aren't any measurements or simulations of absorption caused by the interplanetary medium between the Sun and Earth at the detail you're looking for. I believe it's a fairly homogenous environment with little variation on small scales.

That being said, there are some excellent publicly accessible datasets that detail changes in solar radiation over time. One great source is the [LASP Solar Irradiance Data Center](https://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/), specifically the [EMPIRE SSI Datasets](https://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/data/empire_ssi/), which you can download as a .csv file and convert to audio in any way you wish. It has measurements of spectral irradiance for wavelengths between 115 - 160000nm going back to 1947. Lots of neat possibilities there, and it could be cool to ""hear"" the changes in the Sun's emission over the last few decades!

As for your other questions, pretty much all celestial objects will change an emission spectrum through absorption and reflection, and we often use this to determine what those objects are made of. For example, sunlight bouncing off of Jupiter has a different spectrum than normal sunlight alone, and the differences tell us the chemical composition of Jupiter's upper atmosphere.

For other environments that can affect light, plasmas in the interstellar medium do this when they are subjected to magnetic fields, like the galactic magnetic field. Polarized light (say from a really distant galaxy) is rotated by the [Faraday effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_effect#Interstellar_medium) in proportion to the plasma's properties and the local magnetic fields as it passes through the disk of the Milky Way, giving us a picture of particle density and electromagnetic conditions in these region. The light's wavelength remains constant but the angle of polarization changes as it passes through the medium. Because rotation is a circular change, it is represented by sinusoidal waveforms which could easily be converted to audio signals as well. The [NVSS Catalog](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/nvss.html) could be useful if you're interested in looking at that.

1712,"As currently understood there are three main branches in what happens in type II supernovae. Which branch the supernova follows depends on the mass and state of the core of the progenitor star. In the most massive stars the degenerate cores can collapse into a black hole directly without producing an explosion. Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia article (the circle with a dot means solar masses):

When a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity, it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching 70,000 km/s (0.23c), resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density. What follows next depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core, with low mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars, higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes, and non-degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion.

The initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay, photodisintegration and electron capture, which causes a burst of electron neutrinos. As the density increases, neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core. The inner core eventually reaches typically 30 km diameter and a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus, and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse. If the core mass is more than about 15 M☉ then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova.

So the answer to your question is that the energy is inside the black hole that formed. Most people don't realize that most of the energy generated by a supernova is in the form of neutrino emission. The fact that the core is rapidly becoming denser as the event progresses is what makes it possible for enough neutrinos to be captured to result in a supernova explosion. Still, in the supernovae that actually explode, the majority of the energy still streams away in the form of ghostly neutrinos. So, although they leave behind no evidence, the collapses that manage to swallow even the majority of the neutrinos are the most extreme events of all. We just don't see them.",1609269327,astrophysics,chardo137,Astrophysics,Comment,348
1713,"Stellar-mass black holes are created this way, sure. The formation of *supermassive* black holes is another question. We know that stellar-mass black holes merge, especially now with tons of gravitational wave merger events seen by LIGO/Virgo. That gets you to the 100+ solar mass range. We do see intermediate-mass black holes as of recently. But how you get from stellar -&gt; intermediate -&gt; supermassive is not clear. If it's all just mergers from one to the other to the other, one can ask the question as to how long these take, and one problem is that it might take longer than the current age of the Universe to do so, which obviously could not have happened. So, a lot of people think that supermassive black holes were formed very early on in the Universe, and then the most massive of those that we see today are the results of mergers of supermassive black holes themselves (plus some accretion). So, getting from a billion to ten billion solar masses is ""easy"" to understand. Even getting from a million to a billion is okay. How you get to a million in the first place is still an open problem.",1609262585,astrophysics,themeaningofhaste,Astrophysics,Comment,197

1716,"No they are most likely (certainly) not related. 
A star that collapses into black hole is a ""normal"" (in the sense that our model of stellar evolution does include this outcome in binary systems) occurence. But its rarely observed thats why its an interesting phenomenon. Also the prediction would be that if the star collapses to a black hole there would be a supernova. So its even more interesting to figure out why we didnt measure one..

A missing super massive black hole (smbh) means that they where not abled to find a smbh in the center of a galaxy, usually galaxies have a smbh at theyre center, so its also interesting to find out if there might be galaxie without a smbh at theyre center and study theyre attributes.

So both things are separate occurences that as far as i can tell would not be related.

Also a smbh contains  a orders of magnitude higher amount of mass then the black hole that might have been born out of the star. So the articles refer to a diffrent type (size) of black hole.",1609262055,astrophysics,Der8rauer,Astrophysics,Comment,184

1721,"First of all I think you should have a clearer idea of whether you want to do astronomy, astrophysics or cosmology. The differences can be subtle, but broadly speaking an astronomer observes the night sky and records data, and an astrophysics analyses data or even creates some by running simulations. Cosmology is centred around the study of the origin and fate of the universe as well as its ramifications.
The different paths require different skills; I'm a stellar astrophysicist where I run simulations to study stellar interiors, so in that case your experience in programming from your current project would be quite useful. For astronomy programming is not that useful.

In any case, I'd try to switch to astronomy/astrophysics/cosmology as soon as you're able, so ideally with the master.

If you demonstrate aptitude and interest, it’s unlikely all of your applications will be immediately thrown into the trash. So much of modern astrophysics is computational that CS is a good background. I know a lot of astrophysicists who are absolute garbage programmers, so it’s a good skill to have. You’ll be behind on the actual physics part, but that’s what classes are for, and I know some universities let first-year graduates take undergrad physics classes in such circumstances. Plus, if you’re going for a master’s, a big part of that is preparing you for a PhD, so you generally aren’t expected to be phenomenal in all areas at this point.

I’d say you might as well go for it. There’s little to lose other than the money and time of applying, and the potential payoff is something you really value.

Also, Mimas, a moon of Saturn, experienced an impact that is thought to have nearly disrupted it entirely in the manner that you're envisioning.  The terrain antipodal to an enormous impact crater nearly one-third of the moon's diameter indicates that the shock waves from the impact nearly tore Mimas apart.

1767,"Short answer, no, it would not significantly affect the size and/or shape of Uranus if multiple large bodies impacted it.

This is due to hydrostatic equilibrium, in which Uranus' gravitational force is balanced by the pressure gradient of its constituent matter, forcing the planet (and all other planets and dwarf planets) into an ellipsoidal (not truly spherical) shape.

For all intents and purposes, planets do tend to ""absorb"" impactors smaller than them, regardless of their composition, in that the mass of the impactor is subsequently added to the mass of the planet, less any material that is ejected beyond the planet's Hill sphere.  Terrestrial planets like Earth are just as capable of this as gaseous and icy planets.

It's interesting that you chose Uranus for your question, because we *can* see the result of it being hit by a very large celestial body, likely a protoplanet about the size of Earth: its axis of rotation is tilted beyond 90 degrees from its orbital plane.

So while the shape of a planet is largely unaffected by very large impacts, other characteristics like axial tilt and rotation (cataclysmic impacts can speed up or slow down a planet's rotation) can be dramatically affected.",1609109518,astrophysics,FastWalkingShortGuy,Astrophysics,Comment,200

This is wrong. Dark matter is called that because it doesn't interact with light. It's not a ""fudge factor"". It's distribution and bulk properties are well known. We know where it is, how much there is and this is backed up by many different and independent (galactic as well as cosmological) pieces of evidence predicting the same amount and distribution of dark matter. Some of which listed here

https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6488wb/i_dont_want_to_be_anti_science_but_i_am_doubtful



The LCDM model very accurately describes the evolution of the universe. This is why it is settled now. Popscience regularly underrepresents just how settled it is.  The open question is not regarding whether it's a distribution of particulate matter but what kind of particles it is made of as the dark matter in the standard model (neutrinos) aren't sufficient to account for it. 

In particular it is known quantitatively how matter (dark and baryonic) gravitates, how radiation gravitates and how dark energy gravitates. For dark energy we know from the standard model that dark energy should exist. The problem here is that this predicts much more dark energy than is actually observed. This is called cosmological constant problem. 

For more information please read a book on cosmology first (Ryden or Weinberg).

1772,"&gt;From what I understood, is that black holes have immense gravitational pull because of their sheer mass, but also once the event horizon is passed, that pull grows even more ridiculous, to a point where spacetime has no meaning at all, some suggest they even switch places.

&gt;And that is the part that interests me the most. So, if we take that as truth (gravitational pull is so strong that they (space and time) have no meaning anymore) my question would be


That's not really correct. In schwarzschild  cooridnates the t and r coordinates switch roles but that's specific to this choice of coordinates. As you fall in nothing like that happens, time and space still have a meaning, though you can't escape from a black hole. What does happen is that according to general relativity (maybe not so in a quantum theory of gravity) everything ends in a singularity in finite time.

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/fall_in.html

&gt;what happens to a black hole when/if universe implodes?One of mainstream theories of universe ending are implosion i.e that universe, after expanding for so long, will just turn on itself and start shrinking.

No, the universe doesn't ""implode"" whatever that means. The leading theory is just heat death. Black holes can over very long timescales decay via Hawking radiation but nothing violent happens (this is not a big rip). The universe will just expand and cool down forever. It will not start shrinking again.

&gt;And now, even if universe is infinitely big, once it will eat up all the space there is, all black holes will merge into one, ultra-ultra massive black hole?

No not necessarily.

&gt;once singularity reaches critical point, new universe will begin out of it?

There is no basis in physics to conclude this. This is basically just made up. A black hole is not a big bang and doesn't cause one. Like there is nothing in physics that could justify that claim.

1773,"&gt;I don’t get how we get from smaller that period at the end of a sentence to “a few light years across” in one second... would’nt it be a light-second across? I though the speed of light was an absolute speed limit?

A lot of answers here are wrong. The correct answer is: expansion does not have a ""speed"" (distance / time), it has a rate (1 / time) and that rate is not comparable to the speed of light.

If you fix two galaxies that are very far away from each other and multiply their distance by that rate you get a so-called recessional  velocity and that figure can exceed the speed of light (and even if it does it doesn't mean you can't see that galaxy / that light from that galaxy can't reach you).

But that figure is not a local velocity. What can't exceed the speed of light is the relative velocity between two things that are close to each other (i.e. locally). The velocities of objects that aren't close to each other in general relativity is not really well defined and can have any value. It doesn't mean much. See this link.

 I get that you are just about to start University which is awesome!  Congrats on that!!!  One of the nice things about that is your 'average' grades in school won't really matter as it's more about what you do in the uni anyway.  And, if you do go the grad school route, once you get there it's about research more than grades.  


If you do end up going the geophysics route and are still passionate about astronomy, it may be a good idea to keep an eye out for astronomy summer school like opportunities.  Given that you mentioned being in the Middle East in another comment, there may be opportunities for things similar to [DARA](https://www.dara-project.org/) (which is aimed more for Africa), or from the [IAU OAD](http://www.astro4dev.org/).  And just doing a search at the IAU OAD page, some projects popped up based in the Middle East.  The point is that there are opportunities to add things to your CV that relate to astronomy even if you are studying geophysics (or some other science), that could help you get into grad school later on.

1784,"This is a bit repeating from two other comments, but i’m hoping with some more explanation it maybe is a bit clearer. 

The expansion of space increases the separations between objects in space. Even if nothing is moving, the distances between objects gets larger as space itself expands. 

You can think about expansion in terms of X% every Y seconds/hours/years. Say the universe grows by 1%; all distances will grow by this 1%. If two objects were separated by 1 parsec or kiloparsec or gigaparsec, their separation will become 1.01 parsec or kiloparsec or gigaparsec. This means that at some separation there is a point where the distance between two points grows by faster than the speed of light. But that is okay, because nothing is moving faster than the speed of light, it’s just that the space between them is expanding. 

What happens when the expansion between two points is very much faster than the speed of light is that these two points lose causal connection. You can think of it in terms of sending light signals: it becomes impossible to communicate information from one point to another. And that’s allowed, because again, nothing is moving. It’s just that at early times two points were in causal contact, then they aren’t any more. 

I need to introduce the idea of the time horizon, which is related to the age of the universe: it is the longest distance that an observer can see at their particular place and time in the universe. It defines the edge of the *observable universe*; not everything that is, but everything that can be seen by a particular observer. For us now, our time horizon is just a little beyond the cosmic microwave background. For us now, our time horizon grows a little bit all the time, letting us see just a little bit further away every time we look. 

In very early times the expansion of the universe is very, very rapid. These means that two points have had enough time to influence one another and then lose touch. In these early times this means that areas of space move *out* of an observers time horizon. 

This is important, because it explains how there can been coherent structures on the largest scales. The seeds for these largest structures date back to the period called inflation, at the very, very earliest times. Tiny quantum-scale fluctuations at this time get expanded out to the very largest scales, and we see them now as the longest filaments and superclusters.

1821,"Mainly by modeling the cosmic microwave background (CMB), but also with inputs from the later universe (importantly, type Ia supernova, so-called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and a few other possible inputs).

The super short version is that temperature fluctuations of the CMB look like they were sampled from random process with a specific correlation structure (the angular power spectrum). Those correlations can be predicted from first principles based on a hot big bang with certain amounts of radiation, ordinary matter (that provides pressure support against gravitational collapse), dark matter (that has gravitational attraction but as far as we can tell no pressure to stop from collapsing), and dark energy (the main effect that dark energy has on the CMB is to change the overall angular scale because of late-time acceleration). The first-principles predictions just give a bunch of differential equations, which are simulated with a Boltzmann code (like CAMB), that gives a predicted power spectrum of correlations. This is the forward model, then the fundamental parameters are inferred from the observed power spectrum using Bayesian inference (with a code like CosmoMC).

Vera Rubin first saw this in the rotation of galaxies, because given how stars are distributed, a spinning galaxy should have differing rotational velocities as you move from the center to the edge.  But, from observation, galaxies rotate like a disc, with all parts having the same rotational velocities. So it's just a matter of plugging in the difference to know what additional mass the galaxy needed to have for it to rotate that way and that was called dark matter.

Dark energy is the hypothetical driving force behind the expanding universe.

&gt; Is it possible to measure the speed of particles circling the well of a black hole?

I'm going to guess that the answer to that is ""yes,"" but that what would be measured would not be the speed of any individual particle (which couldn't be detected from such a great distance), but rather, that of the superheated plasma in the accretion disk. Something that hot is going to radiate detectably in the EM spectrum. As the plasma whips around the hole, the radiation from it will be blue shifted at it approaches us, and red shifted as it recedes. As it's the same stuff whipping around and around until it loses momentum and drops in, I would think that one could compare the spectrum coming from one side of the disk with that coming from the other side of the disk (at the same radius) to get some estimate of orbital velocity, if one was able to image the disk, something that has been done before.

1845,"**[Photon sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon sphere)**

A photon sphere or photon circle is an area or region of space where gravity is so strong that photons are forced to travel in orbits. (It is sometimes called the last photon orbit.) The radius of the photon sphere, which is also the lower bound for any stable orbit, is, for a Schwarzschild black hole:             r     =                        3        G        M                     c                2                             =                        3                r                             s                                       2                   {\displaystyle r={\frac {3GM}{c^{2}}}={\frac {3r_{\rm {s}}}{2}}}  where G is the gravitational constant, M is the black hole mass, and c is the speed of light in vacuum and rs is the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of the event horizon) - see below for a derivation of this result. This equation entails that photon spheres can only exist in the space surrounding an extremely compact object (a black hole or possibly an ""ultracompact"" neutron star). The photon sphere is located farther from the center of a black hole than the event horizon.

1873,"**[Celestial coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial coordinate system)**

In astronomy, a celestial coordinate system (or celestial reference system) is a system for specifying positions of satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects relative to physical reference points available to a situated observer (e.g. the true horizon and north cardinal direction to an observer situated on the Earth's surface). Coordinate systems can specify an object's position in three-dimensional space or plot merely its direction on a celestial sphere, if the object's distance is unknown or trivial. The coordinate systems are implemented in either spherical or rectangular coordinates.

1925,"I'm surprised no one has said this yet (as of this comment at least), but a lot of the answer would depend on how much force you exerted during your ""separation"" (on top of some other factors).

A 25-50 foot asteroid wouldn't have much of its own gravity, even if it was solid Osmium or Iridium, the two heaviest metals (and I'm ignoring any sort of exotic substance).  So, it wouldn't take much force to overcome its gravity, in which case you would continue to move perpendicularly (more or less) away from the asteroid, unless and until some other force acted upon you to stop that movement.  

You would also keep moving at the same relative velocity as the asteroid (again, unless and until something acted upon you to change that) and in the same relative direction, since that's what you effectively were doing when you were on it.  Your trajectory that would diverge over time, of course, but would for a long while be the same trajectory, in a macro sense (meaning if it's orbiting the Sun, you too will orbit the Sun for a good, long while, even as you move away from the asteroid).

If you're having trouble picturing this, imagine yourself on a train.  Now, imagine yourself jumping as hard as you can off of the train.  You'll keep moving in the same direction as the train and at the same speed for a little while, even as you ALSO move away from the train.  If you pretend you did this in space, where you don't have the gravity of Earth pulling you down, nor do you have wind resistance to slow you down (and, of course, no train stations to bash into or worries about oxygen deprivation!) then that's basically what would happen on your theoretical asteroid, so long as your jump provides enough force to overcome the gravity of the asteroid.

Now, if the asteroid was bigger and you just gave a small nudge?  Well, then you would go up a bit, and then come right back down since the gravity of the asteroid would be the biggest source of effect on you.  The math to describe the various outcomes based on G of the asteroid and F that you push off with, assuming you know the composition of the asteroid, and of course, you, shouldn't be too difficult (though I'd be lying if I said I could do it off the top of my head).",1608501903,astrophysics,fzammetti,Astrophysics,Comment,412

However, if you try to find the time dilation experienced by an observer standing near a mountain, the resulting value is soooooo small it is negligible. (You gain about 2.5 picoseconds if you were standing 1 meter away from the total mass of mount everest)

The reason time dilation is commonly mentioned in regards to black holes is because these objects are so massive that this dilation exists at a timescale that is relevant to human observation and experience.",1608500977,astrophysics,Azzonk,Astrophysics,Comment,93

Some questions to understand the motion of the asteroid: The forces that keep the asteroid moving would be the gravity of a near by planet? When it exits that force, it will keep going at the same speed because now there are no other forces acting on it?

1930,"&gt;it really depends if you are in gravitanional field of some heavier object like sun, what trajectory does this asteroid has and so on...

I think this is the only thing you said that is correct. Unless you and the asteroid are on identical trajectories, your trajectories will diverge over time due to tidal forces from the larger body.

&gt;Nevertheless, if it was just an asteroid it would loose its kinetic energy, velocity

No. It would not. At least not on any time scales of less than billions of years.

&gt;and accelaration

Whaaat? acceleration is not something that an asteroid or any other body has. It's something that happens to it as a result of some external influence. It can't lose it's acceleration, that doesn't make any sense.

&gt;over time if it wouldnt hit anything nor speeded up in some kind og gravitation field, so no, you would probably slowed down as well

No, for the same reasons as the asteroid would not slow down. See Newton's laws of motion.

&gt;and would be just wondering around in weightlesness like waste from space rockets

This is correct.

&gt;All this without considering the fact that ypu woould most likely die from all the G force

Where would this G force be coming from? In the OP's scenario, there were no significant forces involved.

Think of time as a physical object that is malleable, and things such as relative velocity and gravitational influence can shape it such as it flows ""slower"" or ""faster"" depending on such influences.

1958,"The concept you are circling is called a ""frame of reference.""  Things feel normal within your frame of reference.  No matter what the rate of time passage, a person will always feel time passing ""normally.""  So a person on Miller's planet will feel time passing normally, even though time passes at a much slower rate than on Earth.  A clock brought to Miller's planet will appear to function normally for people on that planet, but to a distant observer (someone with a sci-fi level telescope for example), would see the clock moving incredibly slowly. 

If you want to deep dive into the physics, I highly recommend The Science of Interstellar, by Kip Thorne.

Another physics way of saying this is that EM and gravitational waves both obey Fermat’s principle. Strong gravitational lensing (which is what i think you have in mind) occurs when there are two paths with nearly the same path length. This is totally possible in principle. The difficulty is that the geometry has to be just right, with some massive body to do the lensing basically perfectly placed between us and the gravitational wave source. Think about how many hundreds of billions of galaxies there are within our detection capabilities, and then recognise there are maybe a few hundred good strong lenses. That gives a sense of how rare it is to find that perfect geometry. The other challenge would be to distinguish between two distinct events and a genuine lensing-with-time-delay repeat, especially because it is extremely hard to localise a GW source.

2012,"I don't believe there's one specific formula for the universe's heat death; It's really a combination of a bunch of ideas in physics.

Let's start with what you mentioned, the second law of thermodynamics. It states that in an isolated system, the entropy of that system will never decrease, and will tend toward a maximum entropy value where it will remain constant once reached; this state is known as thermodynamic equilibrium.

For example, a cup of hot coffee will cool until it is the temperature of its surroundings. One way to think of what's actually happening is the ""heat"" or energy from the hot cup of coffee is dissipating. The 2nd law states that this is the natural tendency of energy, to dissipate as much as possible.

So if energy naturally dissipates, what does that mean for the universe? Well it turns out, as Einstein's famous equation tells us, that mass is itself a form of energy. There's even ways to convert it to energy, such as nuclear reactors, or the annihilation of matter and anti-matter. There's also ways to convert energy to matter; this is essentially what the Big Bang did. However it seems there's more ways to do the former than the latter.

So energy wants to dissipate, mass is a form of energy, and the universe likes to convert mass to energy.

Now let's talk about black holes. If you put anything up against a black hole in a fight, the black hole wins. Not only that, but it gets bigger, making it more likely to destroy other objects. This doesn't necessarily mean that eventually everything in the universe will be destroyed by black holes, but you can see why over time black holes will become (one of) the dominant objects left in the universe.

Stephen Hawking has theorized that black holes will slowly evaporate, i.e. convert their mass to energy over time. So eventually any matter that has been swallowed by a black hole will be converted to energy, which again will dissipate.

There will still be things that managed to not get swallowed up by a black hole. The most likely survivors would be things like white dwarfs, which will eventually cool down as well. You see the trend? Unless we have another Big Bang that spontaneously converts a bunch of energy back into matter, we can conclude based on our knowledge of physics that the universe will slowly convert to energy as much as it can, with everything eventually being the same temperature everywhere.

The relevant equations here I suppose would be Einstein's E=mc\^2, the second law of thermodynamics, and the equations for Hawking radiation, but that would be a huge simplification. I'm afraid there's not really a ""plug and chug"" equation like what you might be looking for. The idea of heat death is just a natural logical conclusion of our current understanding of physics. But we also don't fully understand dark matter, and especially dark energy which is ACCELERATING the expansion of the universe, so until we figure that out, it'd be hard to say with certainty what will happen.",1608257372,astrophysics,grunkle_nova,Astrophysics,Comment,518

Doubtful it is infinite or nothing and it doesn't matter really as it's effects are gravitationally the same as any matter outside the event horizon. Don't confuse the mathematical singularity with the popular definition.

Of course, this is always a worry when it comes to science. And worse, most bias might not be intentional. But this is what peer review is for.

And hopefully the EHT will be able to produce more images in the future to provide more data on these mysterious objects.

Yeah, this is true. Assuming the black hole image is 100% accurate, then what we are really seeing is the photon sphere. 

This image of a black hole is not really the best evidence we have for Black-hole objects. That evidence is really the gravitational effects of black holes on nearby objects.  Gravitational lensing and stellar orbits have shown that there is /something/ out there that is invisible but incredibly massive. An study of the center of the milky way showed that the stars in the center were orbiting one of these objects.

2095,"**[Wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave function collapse)**

In quantum mechanics, wave function collapse occurs when a wave function—initially in a superposition of several eigenstates—reduces to a single eigenstate due to interaction with the external world. This interaction is called an ""observation"". It is the essence of a measurement in quantum mechanics which connects the wave function with classical observables like position and momentum. Collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time; the other is the continuous evolution via the Schrödinger equation.

2096,"Precisely as you say. The underlying mechanisms of Quantum Physics are still unknown and hidden behind the postulate of the wave-function collapse. Here you can read about it: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave\_function\_collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse), but in short, when we make an observation of a quantum system, the ""vector"" (wave function) that contains all the possible results of the measurement in its components collapses into a single component by chance (experiment result). Why or how this happens is unknown. Some interpret that the way functions get decohered during the process of measurement, in the sense that one of the components gains probabilistic weight until it's the only one left, some others say that the wave function still exists in its entirety and all the possible outcomes exist in their own reality, but we only get to live in one of them (many-worlds interpretation). So, in this sense, we don't understand how the original fluctuations came about. I hope this wasn't too confusing.

Even further, despite the mystery of the wave function collapse, we do have good quantum mechanics theories that predict the probability of every possible outcome of an experiment to high precision (despite being unable to predict which of the possibilities will happen, as knowing the probability of each face in a dice coming up doesn't mean that you can predict the result). These theories work in most situations except for very high energies, where the quantum effects of gravity become relevant, and as you may have heard, quantum mechanics and gravity don't like each other and this is more or less the border currently known physics, and that's what String Theory or Quantum Loop Gravity are trying to solve with little success. The Big Bang is precisely the time where our theories break down, so we don't even have a theory to explain where the fluctuations come from or what came before Inflation.

So I guess the answer to your original question is: ""yes, we know where does the spin of galaxies come from and understand why is it random, but we don't know how the cause of this comes to be.""",1607886008,astrophysics,AstronomerInDisguise,Astrophysics,Comment,348

Stellarium or some other planetarium software is also useful. It's good to get an intuitive feel for how the planets and stars move across the sky and why they do it. You can then go outside when it's not cloudy and try to figure out where the Ecliptic is yourself etc.

Universe Sandbox and Space Engine are fully astrophysics ""games"", that let you explore around and play with things in space. You can smash galaxies together, look at the configuration of the solar system and distant nebulae etc. You might get a bit of interesting insight from these.

But really, these games really only give you a shallow intuitive feel for a few aspects of astronomy.

A theory that i think is becoming more plausible of what could be out side our universe is the ""Multiverse Theory"" 

Basically that theres billions/trillions, infinite number of universes going through birth, destruction, possibly re birth etc outside of our universe. 

The way I understood that scientist came upon this theory is through ""dark matter"" and the ammount of force it pushes out. Its something like (decimal point) 000000000008. If that decimal happend to be any other number our universe would not exist. If it was a higher number, matter would be expanding away from eachother too fast. If it was lower matter would be expanding away too slow or not at all.

So for the dark matter in our universe to have that exact number of force to form as it is, we are either astronomically lucky, or there is an astronomical amount of universes rolling the dice  so to speak to where rolling .00000008 isnt as improbable. The latter being much more likely the case. As for whats between our universe and others its dark matter thats why dark matter is so mysterious and odd, because its possibly not from our universe but our universe is from it if that makes sense.

Now we would be able to know a supernova in the Milky Way has happened using neutrino detectors.

Located at a distance of 15,800 light-years (4,850 pc), it is the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years. It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars, and a total mass equivalent to 4 million solar masses, making it the most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way. Omega Centauri is very different from the other galactic globular clusters to the extent that it is thought to have an origin as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.

An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that has a much-higher-than-normal luminosity over at least some portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by stars. Such excess non-stellar emission has been observed in the radio, microwave, infrared, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma ray wavebands. A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an ""active galaxy"". The non-stellar radiation from an AGN is theorized to result from the accretion of matter by a supermassive black hole at the center of its host galaxy.

This method is a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous Rhetorica ad Herennium, Cicero's De Oratore, and Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria). Many memory contest champions report using this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.

2238,"**[Human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human)**

Humans (Homo sapiens) are a species of highly intelligent primates. They are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina and—together with chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans—are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes, or hominids). Humans are terrestrial animals, characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other primates; and highly advanced and organized societies.Several early hominins used fire and occupied much of Eurasia. Early modern humans are thought to have diverged in Africa from an earlier hominin around 300,000 years ago, with the earliest fossil evidence of Homo sapiens also appearing around 300,000 years ago in Africa.

2276,"The case of the Pi number is a bit special. This is what we call a pseudo-random number. Pseudo-random means that you compute random outputs from an original seed. Examples are, for example, random numbers computed from the internal clock of computers or the pseudo-random generation of a Minecraft world. If you ask the computer to print another random number at the same time or create a new Minecraft world with the same seed, you should get the same result. However, it appears random because it is very difficult to predict. That's the case of the Pi number too, as it stems from a geometrical definition which can be seen as it's ""seed"". So, in theory, we should be able to compute every single one of its digits, and if someone else computes them with a correct method they will get the same result as us, but it's just unfeasible to do.

The original fluctuations of the universe stem from the quantum fluctuations that existed before the Inflation (or at the moment of the Big Bang if you are not familiar with Inflation). And quantum mechanics is truly random, there is no way to predict the outcome of a single measurement (at least, as we know so far), and someone else repeating the same exact experiment may get different results. Therefore, the randomness of spin in galaxies is genuine, unlike the Pi number.

And finally, yes, in the particular case of the spin of galaxies every possible outcome is represented equally, and this is called a ""uniform distribution"", but it is not a requirement for something to be random. You could have a system with a 90% chance of being A and a 10% chance of being B. The outcome is still impossible to predict with full accuracy, so it is still random, but the possible outcomes are not uniformly distributed in this case.",1607279329,astrophysics,AstronomerInDisguise,Astrophysics,Comment,314

Is random in this case specifically the idea that each possible outcome is represented equally? As I understand it, that's the case when it comes to something like Pi, but the sequence of 'random' numbers is fixed, random because they occur basically the same number of times.",1607278014,astrophysics,CalMcD,Astrophysics,Comment,98

2285,"Because the spin orientation of galaxies is more or less random. I have seen that you don't like ""random"" as an explanation, but random doesn't mean that we don't understand how it works.

The universe is homogeneous and isotropic. This means that, on average, it has the same properties everywhere (mass density, amount of light, amount of spin, etc.) and it doesn't have any preferred direction (i.e., there is no favourite spin direction or mass flow direction). This is an empirical fact. However, there are variations at local scales. For example, there are concentrations of mass in the form of galaxy clusters. Likewise, galaxies do spin, but the spin of all the galaxies in the universe cancels out to zero at large scales. For this to hold, the spin direction of galaxies has to be random.

I know that this sound a bit arbitrary, since why would galaxies care to choose a spin direction that balances out that of their neighbours if it is random? We can go to the origin to understand it. Imagine the early universe as a gas of particles moving at random directions. On large scales, this is very homogeneous and there is no preferred direction. However, on local scales, you have two important things: density fluctuations and movement fluctuations. This means that one volume regions may contain a handful more particles than the neighbouring one and a handful of extra particles moving in one direction. Over time, these over-density fluctuations undergo gravitational collapse and become the galaxies and clusters that we know today. During this process, due to the conservation of angular momentum, the original small fluctuations of velocity become more prominent and become the spin of galaxies. This video exemplifies this process with the easy example of a ballerina that closes her arms: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmnkQ2ytlO8&amp;ab\_channel=OpenStax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmnkQ2ytlO8&amp;ab_channel=OpenStax). For galaxies, it is the same, but the change of size is of orders of magnitude during the contraction, so very small fluctuations end up producing the full-blown spin that we observe today. So, as you can see. As the original fluctuations were essentially random, and so is the current spin of galaxies.",1607252989,astrophysics,AstronomerInDisguise,Astrophysics,Comment,353

You then use the Steffan Boltzmann law to get the Surface Temperature in kelvin, then you use E=kT where k=8.6E-5 eV/K, finally find the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that corresponds with that energy.

2355,"Theory is basically coding simulations, and it's what I do. I do think theory is a little tougher, not because it's more competitive, but because it takes longer to get each paper out, and it tends to not be quite as collaborative so you don't get so many co-authorships. So, you can end up with fewer publications than observers, even if you work the same amount.

But I think the more important thing is to flip your perspective here. It's not about whether you reach the exacting standards of astrophysics academia. It's whether astrophysics academia reaches *your* standards for quality of life and mental health. Do you want to spend years on a PhD, only to most likely end up with a job in industry because there aren't nearly enough permanent jobs? After the PhD, are you happy to hop from job to job in postdocs every couple of years? There's a lot of uncertainty and mental stress in academia, as so much comes down to your own performance as an individual, and there is very little job secuity. On the other hand, you get a lot of flexibility in academia, and a lot of control over how you spend your time, and lots of opportunity to travel. And we do get to work on really interesting stuff. Are they offering enough for the cost you're paying in stress, time, and money? That's up to you to decide. But you aren't a failure just because you decide that something is not worth the sacrifice. 

If it doesn't sound appealing to you, then look for other offers elsewhere. In practice, the day-to-day life of astrophysics is mostly programming (generally Python these days), and technical reading &amp; writing, and you can do a lot of that in other technical fields, in engineering or data science or whatever. These jobs will generally have better job security, and will generally pay better too. You can also do something like a part-time online course-based MSc or graduate diploma in astronomy, just to get a little bit of extra advanced knowledge, without committing yourself to diving into a risky career.",1606987052,astrophysics,Astrokiwi,Astrophysics,Comment,354
2356,"The big choice is whether you really want to pursue a career in astrophysics, or if you just want to learn more about a topic you're curious about. Astrophysics is a tough and competitive career, where completing a PhD still means you only have about a 20% chance of getting a permanent job in astrophysics. It's a massive time commitment, and a risky career. Really, I would only go towards a PhD in astrophysics if you are happy to use the technical skills you got in your PhD to get a job in a different field.

What I would more recommend is a short but still technical/mathematical course, at postgraduate level, so that you can properly dive into the maths &amp; physics of astronomy, and learn more about the fascinating field, without diving too far into a risky career choice. 

One easy thing is that open Yale Courses offers a free course at undergraduate level - you can do the exercises if you like, or just watch the lectures (under ""sessions""): https://oyc.yale.edu/NODE/56

There are also many part-time online graduate courses you can take, that may sate curiosity - e.g. https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/astronomy/part-time/?32gncSi0 - some of these are course-based Masters degrees, some are shorter postgrad ""certificates"" or ""diplomas"". You may be able to do these while finishing up your degree or while working on your first graduate job.

I would clarify though, that astrophysics really isn't about ""trips to higher levels of consciousness"" and ""higher dimensions and other mysteries of the cosmos"". It's mostly about very careful data reduction and analysis. Generally, most of what we don't understand in astrophysics can be explained by frustratingly complex applications of pretty classic physics, rather than exoteric weird unknown physics. Think turbulence rather than multiple dimensions.",1606984600,astrophysics,Astrokiwi,Astrophysics,Comment,290

2358,"The way to think this through is as follows. 

A. Out of all the available academic subjects , where is your core strength ? Is it maths, physics or CS .. ? 

B. If it's physics or a combination of these, does it map to your potential graduate study ? 

You need to feel that when things are hard , you will be able to use your innate interest and ability to excel. 

This is a first order pruning on where to put your graduate study effort. 

C. If after all this you end up with astronomy as the choice, see if you will be happy to just do the study and not get a huge reward/ big results / fame etc. 

If you can be happy just studying the topic and following your curiosity, then and only then jump into the graduate study. 

Many graduate research topics don't succeed right away. it takes 5-6 years in some cases to get that result. 

If these sound bleak compared to the excitement of spending time on a telescope in a scenic setting, or being the first to hear black holes merge or doing time domain astronomy , and perhaps find your cute partner on a dark night in a telescope room, then astronomy isn't for you. 

But if any of the above experiences do sound exciting and worth the hard work and sacrifices, you know the answer.

You can also do what I did, give your self exactly 2 years to try it out. Have a bail out plan to go do CS, data science or finance and really do try to enjoy the work for 2 years. 

In my case, I never left and ended up graduating with a PhD.

One complication you may run into is dealing with the stellar velocities in the Milky Way.  If you are starting with a Milky Way rotation curve, then everything is fine, but if you're trying to construct a rotation curve from stellar velocities, then you will have to deal with some complicated geometry (especially as distances are uncertain).  So you may need to think about the specific project and exercises you want to explore.  If you follow (/u/Astrokiwi)'s suggestion, you might want to think about using extragalactic rotation curves (say M31 or M33) as those have much simpler geometries.",1606835282,astrophysics,LordNotBob,Astrophysics,Comment,122
2394,"You don't ned to worry about dark energy for galaxy rotation curves. Dark matter however makes the job *easier*.

The gravitational potential of a disc is actually quite complex and doesn't have a simple analytic solution, outside of a few idealised discs. But the gravitational potential of something spherical comes out really simply, even if its density changes with distance from the centre of the galaxy. The galaxy's dark matter is in a roughly spherical ball, and it dominates the galaxy's gravity, so you can use Newton's law of gravitation quite directly without problems.

The basic equation is just:

F = GM(R)m/R^2

where R is your distance from the centre of the galaxy, M(r) is the galaxy/dark matter mass inside your distance, m is your mass, and G is the universal gravitational constant.

Using Newton's law F=ma, and the law for circular motion a=v^(2)/R, then given a mass profile M(R) you can get a circular velocity profile, and given a circular velocity profile you can get a mass profile. From the mass profile, you can differentiate to get a density profile if you like. I'm not sure how much calculus is done in high school these days though.

So one exercise is this: if galaxies have flat rotation curves, where v is constant over a large distance, what doe the mass profile M(R) of dark matter approximately look like? You can do that without calculus.

Dark matter is also supposed to approximately follow something called the [NFW profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile). If that's the mass profile (2nd equation on the page), what does the circular velocity profile look like? If you plot it, does it look like a constant profile at some points?",1606830077,astrophysics,Astrokiwi,Astrophysics,Comment,280

Nothing in the universe is completely stagnant. It all moves or has some energy. But changing systems lends themselves well to equations. 

And let's go to the extreme: at the big bang, the physics laws still hold. The variables might be extreme and the equations needed to explain the complex behavior are complicated, but the basic, underlying laws are still there.

2433,"Intergalactic space is filled with high temperature gas and dust that would emit characteristic gamma rays from the regions where positive matter and anti-matter inevitably came into contact. We do not see anything to suggest that there are any meaningful quantities of anti-matter in our universe. Big bang theory itself says that there should have been equal amounts of both created at the beginning of the universe, and the fact that we do not see anti-matter after extensive searches is one of the biggest mysteries in physics. And, as far as we can tell, gravity treats both matter and anti-matter exactly the same. There were some very sensitive tests done just a few years ago on anti-hydrogen in a magnetic trap, and there were no differences detected.

There is no ""outer edge"" of the universe, and there is no ""center"" (unless you wanted to define the center as being in all locations). The big bang was not an explosion into a pre-existing space, rather space and time themselves came into existence at the moment of the creation of the universe. The popular notion that the galaxies are all moving away from one another is just wrong. There is no physical motion involved in the cosmological expansion of the universe. The intervening space between the galaxies is expanding giving the illusion of motion and causing the redshift that we observe at cosmological distances. This is not just a guess, our universe would look radically different if it were an explosion into a pre-existing space. We would see an expanding shell of galaxies around us in a sheet like the Milky Way except composed of galaxies instead of stars. Or, if you could figure out some way to have the Milky Way left behind at the very center while everything else was ejected outwards, we would see all external galaxies as equidistant. Even less believable would be any attempt to recreate what we actually observe about the structure and dynamics of our universe with reference to an explosion into a pre-existing space.

No, antimatter has a positive gravitational force, you're thinking of negative matter (which is hypothetical and likely doesn't exist).

There can't be galaxies made out of antimatter, as there is interstellar dust and we'd see the annihilation.

&gt;the acceleration at the outer-edge of the universe is momentum balanced by a kind of anti-gravity pressure inwards, which more reflects almost wave-like ripples in the ""galaxy density"" of the universe—thinning at the edges and condensing near the center.

The same way you can see the television next to your speaker if you stand in your livingroom.

So where is the difference? The difference is that the speaker in your livingroom is not that far away from the television like the stars are from each other.

2492,"For people with ADHD, good luck reading this lengthy post.  Lol

I'm not an astrophysics student but here's my experience.  The biggest help with working with ADHD is understanding what it is.  When I was first diagnosed of ADHD, I had little knowledge of what it is, but the common thing I hear from people is ""it is basically the lack of attention"".  This is part true.  The full truth is, it is the ""inability to focus your attention because you have so much of it"".  As for me, my brain will do its best to focus on everything all at once.  This sounds great, except human brain has limited focus, so basically the processing power is stretched out depending on how much the input is.

So basically you need your ADHD brain to really chill down and focus or narrow down that attention/input in order to fully process whatever you need to really process at the moment (for me, I base that decision on priority).  In addition, you need to remove unnecessary stimulus that could potentially divide your attention.  You may need to redesign your environment for this.  This particular topic is extensive but James Clear, author of Atomic Habits, talked about this aspect pertaining to habits in his book/audiobooks, but it is also tied to helping minimise unwanted stimulus in my own opinion.

Medication had an impeccable impact in improving my focus because it gave me a kickstart in what I need to do to work with my ADHD.  I initially declined medication, but thank goodness I tried it because it made a huge difference.  It's like night and day.  For the first time, I feel calm and present - I guess like a normal person.  Without medication, I don't think I would have been able to focus on reading studies and articles about ADHD.  I could not sit down to fully read and absorb anything for the life of me.  Without it, I don't think I would have been able to create a functioning task list.  Without it, I don't think I would have been able to stablish fundamental strategies on how to deal with ADHD.  But it doesn't come with a downside.  Initially, I suffered from the side effects mainly the suppression of appetite and disruption of sleep pattern.  Lack of sleep neutralises the benefit of having a more focused attention.  What's the point, at that point?  I hated it so much, but I just rolled with it until I developed countermeasures.  These days, I'm okay missing a day or two doses of it.

Meditation helps a lot.  There are days when my brain has no chill despite of medication and adequate sleep.  I still find it funny that an ADHD brain is able to calm down through meditation, like it sounds impossible!  It's almost impossible to meditate at first, but with medication and persistence, it paid off.  It helps you develop a skill of extra resilience against distractions.  I have better detection when my brain starts to think about blackholes, photosynthesis, where is Xür this week, what happens when the current president refuses to concede, did I close my garage door, who manufactured the chair I'm sitting on right now, or I bet it's really cold in Antarctica right now - during an executive meeting.  You would be able to detect situations likes these more often than not and tell your brain to stfu and pay attention.

Psychology is extremely beneficial.  As I mentioned previously, an ADHD brain wants to focus on everything all at the same time.  I suppose that a typical human brain enjoys tuning into pleasurable stimuli.  Multiply this by 100 on an ADHD brain, then you either get into multiple projects all at once (and not finish any of them) or trigger a hyperfocus.  I find that rewarding myself with pleasurable stimulus after completing a boring but necessary task is effective.  I go out of my way to prevent myself from getting a reward for doing nothing. I further write down the task as ""finish all chapter 9 assignments then watch youtube for 2 hours"" or ""return amazon package then open instagram"".  Those two examples are kind of labeled long for example, but I find it more effective if the label is short and concise (processing fluency) ie, ""finish all chap 9 then YOUTUBE 2 hrs"".

These are just some of the stuff that I do daily to help me work with ADHD.  Sometimes there are bad days, but far more good days.  I still struggle with tardiness, but I've developed my life style to work around it now lol.  Having ADHD while being a college student is extremely hard.  Sometimes I still wish I was ""normal"".  People with ADHD have to do extra work to overcome basic things and often suffer from consequences of natural circumstances.  I used to say, ""This is not fair.""  But f it, you already have it, so just work with it.  On the super positive side, my brain is full of random knowledge to help me survive an alien invasion.  Lol

I hope this helps.",1606443886,astrophysics,JonesCali,Astrophysics,Comment,850
2493,"It really depends on which modules you pick in later years. In the first couple of years they kind of give you a brief taste of some of the key math skills in each field. The good thing is that you can choose your modules based on the maths that will be involved. For example, im 4th year astrophysics and I haven't had to solve an ODE via any method other than direct integration  since second year. This is generally the theme with astro modules, the maths isn't so heavy (unless you do GR in which case you should try and get familiar with vector spaces).

In general, differentiation is pretty important, integration techniques, however, are not (at least at my uni) they usually provide the results from complex integrals. I would assume you would only have to be good at adiabatic processes and thermal stuff if you pursued a materials route (i also found this pretty boring).

I never really memorise mathematical techniques, I can fairly quickly remind myself of them when I need to use them, the only memorisation that really occurs is before an exam lol

My advice would would be to speak to a tutor or lecturers to find out some of the maths in other modules if you're interested.

For me, there are days of absolute highs, when I’m on top of my game, ahead of assignments, being able to answer questions in class, but even so slightest mistakes or embarrassment can cause me to collapse. Eventually, I get back at it again. (Though from years of experiencing this, I cautiously pick myself back up) 

Then there are days like this, where my apartment is a full mess, I’m behind on assignments, exam preparation, and my TA duties. I don’t even sleep because I’m worried about the amount of work I have. I’ll get random bursts of motivation but that usually gets wasted on shaking my head to whatever music I feel like at the time. 

Since classes are all online (and class size for astrophysics is small), there isn’t that requirement for me to pay attention during class, so I end up doing almost everything non-productive during that time. It’s even hard to play a video game or do anything relaxing to.. well get a reset.

What is it that you’re struggling with specifically? maybe we can help you pick some of it apart?

Do you have/ are you talking to a therapist or psych? medicated? do you have an academic advisor? possibly a disability/accommodations advisor? do you have a plan / some kind of accommodations?

Same with teachers - and I know, I’ve also had my share of uncaring ones - but they are mostly people who want you to succeed and want to know where you’re struggling, but they have to know to help!

Try to take notes about what you are struggling with, where you get stressed, where you get lost, and talk to a therapist about it. Those are good starting points. 

The mistake I always make is thinking I can just do it myself and just wOrK hArD and push past whatever, but its not always (see: like, never) that simple. We need help! Everyone needs help! Do the service to yourself of getting it, the way you need it - keeping in mind just understanding that is a problem and journey itself, which can compound and add to frustration, but idk where you are on this part of the acceptance and understanding journey. 

Remember! You are not the problem! Your brain is not THE or A problem! Trying to fit our _totally fuckin radical_ brains into the rigid structure of (school || work || capitalist society) is a compatibility struggle not of our own design, and is certifiably difficult.

It's what I actually want to do! My idea is to work in Control Systems for rockets, probes, satellites and the like. A specialization called GNC (Guidance, Navigation and Controls).

Thing is, you have to usually convince a jury or your PhD advisor to grant you money for 3+ years.

If you want to do specifically cosmology, or anything astrophysics related, you might want to try to get into a second Master's degree, specialized in Astrophysics. Getting in is not easy, but again, you can be convincing if you have a decent physics level. This will help you enter the network of astrophysics in the country you're in, and find potential phD. laboratories you want to work in.

It'll helps you being convincing since a PhD in astrophysics is a question of skills, but also a question of a human relationship between a student and his advisor.

My question is, given your engineering field, why not directly go for space application? It's more on the technical side, but building, designing space missions, instruments, might be easier since you already have the diplomas and is an engineering job working closely with researchers. In my country, we have some labs where researchers and engineers have specifically the double denomination as engineer-researcher.

Finally, it's not rare to have people 30+ stopping their career, going into a master's degree or finding a PhD, and going through academia in astrophysics.

2575,"Some maths, which I think you'll be able to handle at AP level:

Roughly, disc galaxies mostly have ""flat rotation curves"". The stars all move at about the same speed, over a very large range of distances from the centre. 

The basic equation for circular motion is:

v^(2)/R = a

where *a* is acceleration. This acceleration is from the gravity of all stars and gas and dark matter inside the orbit of the star (which is at a radius R, and moving at a speed v). If you're dominated by a spherical dark matter halo, you can use Newton's Law directly for gravity:

a = GM(R)/R^2

Note that this is M(R) - we're *inside* the dark matter halo, so the mass is not fixed, but is a function of radius. The further out you go, the more mass there is inside your orbit.

We put those together and we get

v^(2)/R = GM(R)/R^2

Which we can rearrange to:

v^(2)R = GM(R)

So, just knowing we have a flat rotation curve will straight away give us what the mass distribution of dark matter will be - we know that v and therefore v^2 is constant, and G is constant, so M(R) is just proportional to distance.

2579,"&gt;  Is there an equation that explains the velocities of stars related to the distance they are from the center of the galaxy? Or is are the rates inconsistent between each band?

Not to my knowledge (again someone correct me if I'm wrong). The problem is that the velocity at any given point inside of a galaxy is proportional to the mass surrounding that point. But we can't actually measure that mass because part of it is undetectable dark matter. The only way we have any idea of that amount of dark matter out there is by working backwards from the velocity. So since we can't measure the dark matter, we have no way of working forwards to a velocity from the measured mass if that makes any sense. 

Like there are equations out there that relate moment of inertia to rotational velocity like the ones for [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum). But those are for rigid bodies and while I'm sure there are ones out there in fluid dynamics, at the end of the day you'll still be left with two unknowns: (actual) mass of a galaxy and rotational velocity for any given band.

2586,"So first off, what you're looking for is called a [galactic rotation curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve). The problem is that the rotational velocity of any object within a galaxy is dependent on how far from the galactic center you are. So there isn't a single angular velocity number. I suppose you can calculate the average rotational velocity, but that sort of loses a lot of info. 

What's more useful is knowing the average rotational speed of any point given its distance from the center of the galaxy. The only way to obtain this information is to just measure how fast stars are moving in a given band. So what you'll find is less of a purely mathematical relationship and more of a this is what we observed, here are the numbers for a particular galaxy. Which by the way varies depending on what galaxy you're talking about. There rough relationships that describe the rotational velocity against some other factor such as mass in the [Tully-Fisher relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tully%E2%80%93Fisher_relation). Ultimately the best answer depends on what you're trying to accomplish here.

&gt; How does the most basic angular velocity equation compare to calculating the angular velocity of the Milky Way galaxy?

For a particular band or ring of matter within a galaxy, I believe you can treat it like a rotating ring with constant angular velocity. But the larger you make that band, the less accurate your rotational velocity will be since some parts of that band will be moving at different velocities to other parts.

&gt;Are the calculations of all galaxies similar?

Yes, for the most part, we model galaxies using Newtons law of gravitation for simplicity. You could use general relativity, but that get's way more complicated.  

&gt; How does dark matter affect the calculation? Or does the angular velocity stay the same with the effect of dark matter on the rotation? I would assume that dark matter would cause a certain star to rotate faster at some points, but is this completely wrong?

That is a really good question and you should read the galactic rotation curves wiki page I linked. The tl;dr is that when we sum all the mass in a galaxy, run it through Newtons laws of gravitation along with the rotational kinematic equations, we get a velocity curve that a galaxy SHOULD be. But when we observe the actual rotational velocity curve, it's faster than our calculations. Our only *good* answer to this discrepancy is that we think there is a massive dark matter halo (which you can imagine as a giant oblate spheroid) encompassing all galaxies which consists of dark matter. This additional dark matter is what accounts for the extra mass needed to speed up everything in the galaxy to match the observed rotation curve.

&gt; When calculating the rotational velocity of the Milky Way galaxy, are we looking at the movement of one star close to the center or at the edge of the galaxy? 

We measure all stars if we can, see the rotational curve.

&gt; How do we know the size of the galaxy and the movements of a star within the galaxy?

Just observations taken via telescope. All matter in a galaxy follows Newtons law of gravitation and Kepler's laws of planetary motion. So if you measure the movement of a single star over time, you can project its course forward and backward in time (all stars move in elliptical paths).

It shouldn't really. If you notice the earth and moon(can be applied to sun and earth) are on opposite sides of the barycenter(ie if one is left of the barycenter the other will be right). Meaning that the gravity of one pulls the other toward the barycenter and vice versa, Resulting in both objects getting pulled toward the barycenter. To balance this, there is the centrifugal force pushing both outwards. Thus creating a stable orbit(I know its not a ""real"" force but Its much simpler to just use it in place of me describing the inertia of objects and whatnot).

I think the situation you are thinking of is when both the Earth and Sun are both on the same side of the barycenter(ie both objects are left of the barycenter). Then one object will be pulled toward the barycenter and one away and then there's the centrifugal force pushing both of them out. If it is possible to orbit at the same speed(not actual speed but   
instead I am using ""speed"" to describe time it takes to complete one orbit regardless of the circumference of the orbit) but at a different radius(which its not possible) and the sun and the earth are orbiting at the same ""speed"" then The objects would slowly get closer(their orbital radii would get closer in distance). However its not possible to orbit at different radii and different ""speeds"" so this instead creates an unbalanced system that (generally) over time will result in a object shifting orbital radius or changing angular velocity(Actual speed) to eventually lead to the objects being on opposite sides of the barycenter

This is wrong. By your logic none of particle physics would work. But anyway, black holes can merge. It's not about their singularities, which may well not even exist (a theory of quantum gravity should make a different prediction for the interior of a black hole). The event horizons are encompassed by a larger horizon that over time evolves into the one of the larger black hole while emission of gravitational waves takes place.

&gt;Now, th Plank Length seems to be more and more likely to be an actual thing. Which would maybe offer a explanation. Because if you go beneath the plank length, space and time stop making sense and the laws of physics do not really adhere.

The laws we have now break down but it's not a pixel size of the universe or anything like that. It's the scale where quantum gravity effects become important.

There is no paradox here. Microscopic physics of black hole mergers isn't known (rather than being paradox). Macroscopically it's well known and experimentally tested.

2717,"The light doesn't leave the black hole surface, it doesn't reach it. Around the BH there is a very hot region that emits X-Rays, after which it is reabsorbed and re-emitted by the surrounding torus. So you have an excess of X-rays, which we can detect + an excess of infrared from the torus (which we can also detect, but that's a bit trickier). Also some quasars (such as 3C196 or 3C273, which is discussed below) are also radio-loud, so they emit a large quantity of gas that is bright in the radio regime. I work on those galaxies, in particular in how they impact the surrounding region - as the gas cools, it becomes fainter at higher frequencies (&gt;1 GHz), but remains just as bright at ultra-low frequencies (~10-80 MHz). This is right in the range of ULF observatories, such as LOFAR! By comparing maps in ULF with GHz+ maps (like from LBA L/S-band), we can see how old the plasma is at different places!

Perhaps the first thing that you might consider looking at is what the spin periods and spin period derivatives (how much is the pulsar slowing down over time) are and how those might group up. What I would do is use the [ATNF Pulsar Catalogue](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/) to find information on the pulsars. If you click on the checkboxes for P0 (spin period) and P1 (spin period derivative), you'll get a huge table of numbers (if you click the Table button) that you can use to put into something like excel and plot the different values. Or, you can even use the Plot button, but make sure near the bottom that you have on the X-Axis ""P0"" and then on the Y-Axis ""P1"", then click each to be log instead of linear. You should see a plot like [this](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/proc_form.php?version=1.64&amp;P0=P0&amp;P1=P1&amp;startUserDefined=true&amp;c1_val=&amp;c2_val=&amp;c3_val=&amp;c4_val=&amp;sort_attr=jname&amp;sort_order=asc&amp;condition=&amp;pulsar_names=&amp;ephemeris=short&amp;coords_unit=raj%2Fdecj&amp;radius=&amp;coords_1=&amp;coords_2=&amp;style=Long+with+last+digit+error&amp;no_value=*&amp;fsize=3&amp;x_axis=P0&amp;x_scale=log&amp;y_axis=P1&amp;y_scale=log&amp;state=query&amp;plot_bottom.x=61&amp;plot_bottom.y=23) and maybe you'll start to note some interesting features! Play around with some of the other values and plotting them and you can learn quite a lot! 

For radius, you won't find many because we only now the mass/radius of one neutron star and only very recently with the NICER telescope. There are some other radius measurements but with very large uncertainties.

This is the reason why science is built on mathematical models - to take the human and human logic out of the reasoning process.

In other words: any (astro)physical model such as CCC must make predictions that are testable.

&gt; *Page would go on to establish a timeline of a black hole’s lifespan—shaped like an upside-down V known as “Page time” or the “Page curve”—it described how information which fell into the black hole would escape through emitted Hawking radiation until the black hole was no more. This was called “entanglement entropy,” and set up physicists for a 30-year lay up to make a slam dunk calculation.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *The slam dunk was started in October 2018 by Ahmed Almheiri at the Institute for Advanced Study when he used quantum computing to create a universe in which a simple black hole system located at the center of space began emitting radiation as per Hawking’s theory.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *The system begins to radiate as one entangled particle enters and another one leaves. This process continues, and the number of entangled particles increases, increasing the level of entanglement entropy.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *If one imagines the black hole as the contents of a snow globe, and the glass of the globe as the event horizon (the edge of the black hole where the laws of physics begin to break down), Almheiri found that as the entangled entropy grew within the system, a “quantum extremal surface,” formed on the glass of the snow globe, just inside the event horizon.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Everything inside the quantum extremal surface is not part of the black hole, but rather like a collection of entangled particles which no longer contribute to the entropy in the system. Furthermore, the innermost particles in the simulated black hole became likewise detached from the black hole, forming something which Almheiri called “the island.”*  
&gt;  
&gt; *At this point, non-entangled radiation begins to be emitted, and the black hole breathes itself out of existence.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *In demonstrating that entanglement entropy of black holes followed the Page curve, Almheiri and his friends confirmed that black holes do in fact release information, though it comes out in such disorder as to appear like an encrypted password.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *By now if one’s brain is still working after all this, Almheiri’s research amazingly includes theoretical tools that would allow researchers to “decrypt” the scrambled entangled particles in the quantum extremal surface, and figure out what they are and where they came from.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Last year, having just solved a 50-year puzzle and proved Page’s life’s work, the team decided to focus on the mysterious “island” of particles that were in—but not “of” the black hole. The island is part of the radiation, but haven’t flown out or been transferred to the extremal surface.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *This disconnect is theorized as being part of the reason why black holes go down the other side of the Page curve, and if solving the black hole information paradox seemed hard, Musser described the issue of the mysterious island as causing the team to “look off into the distance, momentarily lost for words.”*",1605133437,astrophysics,snooshoe,Astrophysics,Comment,548

The only thing we can all agree on is the speed of causality, which is the same as the speed of light.

All of our observations seem to show that the entire universe operates under the same laws of physics no matter the speed or location of the observer. If causality had a different speed in another part of the universe (and any physicists can correct me if I'm wrong here) then the laws of physics and the fundamental forces would be totally altered there and it's possible that matter would not even be able to exist, or that it would be very different.

How far through undergrad are you now? I hope that you've had more luck in finding decent people to be friends with. If not and you're still having to put up with this kind of behaviour I would honestly say you should report it if you haven't done so already.

2878,"Your experience of lacking role models that you could relate to is a real problem for women in STEM (as well as other underrepresented groups like people of colour). It's a big focus for outreach work in schools, which is something I've always really enjoyed doing. So if you get any opportunities to do something similar, I'd absolutely recommend it as you can have a really big impact. And for yourself, it's becoming increasingly common for departments/faculties to have discussion forums for women to share experiences and advice.

I'm a guy, so personal experience is obviously something I can't claim to have. But there's definitely a change in attitude once you get to PhD level. The atmosphere does get more professional, and any inappropriate behaviour from other grad students or academics would definitely be dealt with seriously.

Female friends have told me about a couple of unpleasant interactions they've unfortunately had, but both of those have been from external speakers rather than anyone within the department. I would also say that I got the impression that they were just poorly judged comments rather than deliberate attempts at sexism (not that this justifies them). And again, if you do experience anything like this, there will be sympathetic ears within the department as well as a process for getting it dealt with.

For context I should add that this comes from a UK perspective, but I'm not aware of big differences between us and the US (since you called it college I'm guessing that's where you're from).",1604503463,astrophysics,nivlark,Astrophysics,Comment,255

I relate so much when you mention that people just don’t listen to what you are saying. My first semester I was in an engineering class and my team was all men except for me. It’s like they take you less seriously for some reason. 

I am taking computer science classes and astrophysics classes, and most of the creeps I encountered were in my comp sci classes. I also felt like my astrophysics classes were fairly even gender wise, and fairly diverse. My C.S. classes, on the other hand, were very clearly male dominated. I had a CS lab where there was only one other girl in the class.

2880,"I am always happy to rant about weird guys, thanks for asking haha

One example of me getting creeped on is how in the first month or so of college I kept trying to befriend people in my classes. I wouldn’t be flirty or anything, just nice and wanted to know people in my major. We would exchange numbers and then they would immediately ask me for sex. If it happened just once I would not have thought much of it, but it kept happening so I kind of stopped talking to guys in my classes. Some notable messages were being sent a meme saying “what if you gave me a BJ jk... unless” and another guy asking me to ride him like a unicycle. There are a few more stories, but those instances are the ones that bother me the most. It was just uncomfortable to be reduced to my body over and over again by people I thought were going to be friends. 

There was another guy who didn’t jump straight to harassing me for sex; nonetheless, he didn’t see me as a human being but just as his love interest. He got super obsessive, and continued to try to pursue me even after he found out I had a boyfriend. Luckily, he switched majors. 

If you are a guy reading this and you are concerned that you may be a creep, you are probably self aware enough to not be a creep. I think a big thing to keep in mind is that although you may be attracted to a woman, they are not in STEM to be your love interest. They are in STEM because they are passionate about it. If you have a crush on one of your peers, that is fine! Just make sure you respect her boundaries and her as an individual. 

I am hoping that the reason that the men in my classes are acting like this is not because they are actively trying to be sexist, but because they have not fully matured or just haven’t had an actual relationship with a woman. Maybe as they gain more life experience, they grow out of this behavior. I guess I will find out.",1604501008,astrophysics,tryingmybestjk,Astrophysics,Comment,371
2881,"Hi! 

I am a female PhD student in astronomy/astrophysics on the way to finish my degree. I do have a similar story like yours. I was always super fascinated by space, so now working in this field is somewhat of a dream coming true. When I started my studies I was not really aware of many female astrophysicists and when I started my programme in Physics (European Bachelor and Master before PhD), we were 20% women in the lectures. Of course there were many male idiots around who made clear that they thought women should do something else, but it got better with the years.

Doing a PhD at a big European Institute, I can say that we have between 40 - 60% female PhD students starting each year, but the more senior the people are the less women you find. There is hope that this will solve itself with more and more women going down this career, but there are also some problems that especially prevent women from  persuing a career in Astro/Academia in general: the job security is barely non-existent. You will have to move country several times before hoping to get a permanent position and at each step (PhD -&gt; Post-doc -&gt; Post-doc -&gt; something permanent) more and more people drop out and leave the field. This usually hits women harder than men because we usually don't have a spouse that is taking care of the kids and is willing to move around with us every few years. 

About the creepy encounters: I had them myself and I know a dozen stories about these creeps. However, those are specific old guys that everybody knows about (and nothing happens unfortunately), but that also means you can usually avoid them. If you decide to study Astro, my biggest advice would be to choose your supervisor carefully and talk to other students. A great (female) supervisor knows the biggest creeps out there and can help you to avoid them. Of course, it is horrible that these problems still exist, but I think we will only be able to change them from the inside. 

If you excel in maths and physics than I don't see any reason why you should not be able  to study astrophysics. Depending on the field you choose there is not even that much of hardcore theory involved. Btw, maybe check out the supernova foundation ([https://supernovafoundation.org/](https://supernovafoundation.org/)). They offer mentorship for young women and gender minorities that want to study natural sciences.

(2) I found that in college, I didn’t experience a lot of sexism or boundaries in the course work or with professors, mostly just with other peers. When I got to grad school it was a whole other story. There are still many roadblocks you have to go through once you’re in higher education. I think there has been a lot of focus in improving undergraduate environments for women and minorities in STEM, but not with graduate school and up. It’s getting better slowly, but it’s something to push through and decide for yourself if you want to continue on or switch out. It can be exhausting and you don’t deserve to fight battles that exist because of a system that fails you. I’m about done with my PhD now, but out of the 6 women from my class only 3 stayed in the program to finish.",1604499776,astrophysics,lil-guac,Astrophysics,Comment,188

My university also has the Society for Women in Physics (SWiP), and they have encouraged us undergrads to go to the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP).

It's curvature of spacetime, so yes. One of its effects is time dilation -- a clock closer to a source of gravitation lags behind one further out -- so yes.    


But I'd really want to answer 'no', for the human language here is easily misleading, and might initiate thought processes that require mathematics and a more comprehensive treatment of general relativity to follow through.

2907,"&gt;We move through space and space also moves through time.

2943,"You're kind of looking at it backwards. What we know is that the further you look back in time, the hotter and denser the universe was. If you look far enough back, you hit a time when the universe on average, was an opaque warm plasma, visible to us today as the cosmic microwave background radiation. We can't ""see"" beyond that barrier because the universe is no longer transparent to light before that time, but someday maybe neutrino or gravitational wave astronomy will give us alternate ways to peer beyond that barrier.

In the meantime, many of our well-tested theories allow us to predict what we could see beyond the CMB, and we can verify some aspects of those, for instance our physical models allow us to predict the ratio of hydrogen to helium that will form during a very hot period we can't see, and our studies of the stars indicates that these values are correct. 

However, once you go far enough back in time the universe is so hot and dense that our theories no longer work, and we can't replicate the conditions in any experiment. So beyond that point, really we just don't know what things were like; there are many ideas but currently we have no way of testing what the truth is. And it's not necessarily so that the universe began as a point: it could have been quite large or even infinite in extent at that time -- extremely dense doesn't necessarily mean small.

So I think that's the best way to think about it: the big bang doesn't really say where everything came from, what it says is that the further you look back in time the hotter and denser the universe was until it hits such an extreme point we can't definitely say what happened.",1604279772,astrophysics,claimstoknowpeople,Astrophysics,Comment,303

2953,"Great choice of topic!

&gt; Is one of the stars in a binary system bigger than the other generally?

The odds of two stars being *exactly* the same size is basically zero, so really, you need to specify how similar you want to stars' masses/radii to be in order to call them the same.
Typically, we refer to stars with masses within 5% of each other as 'twins'.
[This behemoth of a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05347.pdf) has a lot of information about binary stars' properties, although there is still some uncertainty which comes from the difficulty of measuring every property of every binary star.
The figure you'd be most interested in is figure 2, on page 5. The mass ratio, *q*, is the mass of the smaller star divided by that of the larger star, so it is always between 0 and 1, with *q* &gt; 0.95 indicating stellar twins.
There are three parameters which describe the distribution of *q*:  γ_smallq,  γ_largeq, and F_twin.
These are listed throughout the paper with the values varying for different kinds of star, and different studies.

&gt; I know they can vary in size as they can be average or massive, so what is a size range for average stars and range for massive stars?

As well as depending on its mass, a star's radius also depends on its evolutionary stage. We usually describe stellar radii in terms of the sun's radius. At the moment, the sun's radius is obviously 1, but when it expands to become a giant star, it will be about 10 times the size. At the very end of its life, it will become an asymptotic giant branch star, with a radius around 200-300 times its current size.
More massive stars are unsurprisingly larger, by generally not by more than a factor of 10 compared to the sun at each evolutionary stage (i.e. 10 -&gt; 100 -&gt; 2000 solar radii).
The least massive stars, which are the most common, have radii around 0.1 times that of the sun (around the size of Jupiter), and this radius is not predicted to change much over their very long lifetimes.
The [Wikipedia article on stellar evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) is a good overview - check the sources for more information.

&gt; What is the lifetime range of an average binary star system and a massive binary star system?

This is tricky, since it depends on the masses of both stars, and the size of the binary orbit. A decent rule of thumb is that stars have a lifetime of around 10 billion years * (M / Msun)^(-2.5). So you could calculate that time for the less massive star in the binary. For the most massive stars, that time is a few million years; for the least massive, it is around a trillion.
The lifetime of the binary can be shorter than this if the orbit's semimajor axis is smaller than the maximum radius of one of the stars.
This can lead to Roche-lobe overflow or common envelope evolution, during which the two stars can merge, or one of their envelopes can be stripped off and ejected.
It's worth noting that there are plenty of 'dead' binaries, consisting of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.
Over very long timescales, their orbits shrink due to gravitational wave emission, eventually causing them to merge, which we can detect with interferometers like LIGO, VIRGO, and KAGRA.
You can calculate the timescale with the formula [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Binaries).

&gt; Is there any special thing that happens during the stellar nebula stage to form 2 stars?

This isn't really my area, but I think there's a fair amount of uncertainty about exactly how binaries are formed.

One way could be similar to planet formation in a circumstellar disc - essentially forming a planet so large that is becomes a star. You would expect these systems to have quite extreme (i.e. very small) mass ratios, though.

A second option is that the two stars formed separately, and were gravitationally captured into a closed orbit during an interaction with a third body. This is fairly unlikely to happen, though, except in areas with very high densities of stars.

The final (and generally accepted) way is by fragmentation of a collapsing gas cloud. If the cloud has too much angular momentum, it will be unable to fully collapse into a single star. Roughly speaking, as the cloud contracts, its rotation speed increases until centrifugal force will tears it into two pieces. Each of the pieces can then collapse to form a star (unless it still has too much angular momentum).",1604241562,astrophysics,xilefakamot,Astrophysics,Comment,761

It’s believed that some of these may be due to Cryovolcanoes on the moons’ surfaces caused by tidal friction of their parent planets.

Titan has oceans and rivers of liquid methane and I believe we have direct pictures of these from the Huygens probe, but someone correct me if I’m wrong.

A more commonly known one is the rampant geological features on Mars that point strongly towards the theory that Mars had liquid water oceans and rivers far in the past.

Europa and Ganymede are believed to have subsurface oceans deep under their icy crusts, and some theorize that they could sustain life.

Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system with 400+ active volcanoes and many mountains taller than Everest due to the immensely strong tidal friction from Jupiter.",1604122679,astrophysics,I_Am_From_Mars_AMA,Astrophysics,Comment,216

And like another person mentioned, any slight perturbation and the central star crashes into your torus, and solar systems are filled with slight perturbations.

A toroid around a sun would need to rotate around the sun at around the same speed as a normal planet at that orbit or, if it doesn't rotate that fast, would need to be made of some very strong material. 

The whole system would be metastable, in that any gravitational disruption or tides from another body would make the system a bit off-center and the star would then crash into the toroid. (I say star crashes into the toroid since the toroid planet is probably much more massive than the star.) Or else make the toroid crash apart into multiple spherical bodies.

This effect is worse if you are not shielded by Earth's magnetic field (i.e. Geosynchronous is worse than LEO). In fact, a very large CME can knock out electronics and the power grid even on the surface of the Earth.

The Alcubierre drive, Alcubierre warp drive, or Alcubierre metric (referring to [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor#Lorentzian_metrics_from_relativity)) is a speculative idea based on a solution of [Einstein's field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) as proposed by theoretical physicist [Miguel Alcubierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Alcubierre), ***by which a spacecraft could achieve*** [***apparent faster-than-light***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_faster-than-light) ***travel if a configurable*** [***energy-density***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density) ***field lower than that of*** [***vacuum***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum) ***(that is,*** [***negative mass***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_mass)***) could be created.***

 Faster-than-light [warp drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_drive_(Star_Trek)) travel via subspace works similarly to the [Alcubierre Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_Drive), but obeys different laws of physics.

&amp;#x200B;

In most *Star Trek* series, **subspace communications are a means to establish nearly instantaneous contact with people and places that are light years away.** The physics of *Star Trek* describe infinite speed (expressed as warp factor 10) as an impossibility; as such, even subspace communications which travel at speeds over Warp 9.9 may take hours or weeks to reach certain destinations.",1603743530,astrophysics,reddit455,Astrophysics,Comment,168

If you follow that reasoning, wormholes in a 3D universe should require a 4th dimension.

No. That's just wrong from the start because in the first part you are describing just an analogy. You do not need a third dimension for a 2d space to have a topology with wormholes. It's just not needed. It is just used to demonstrate it to you, because it is easier to visualize like that.

Wormholes in 3+1d spacetime do not require a 4th spatial dimension for the same reason.

Just like expansion doesn't require extra dimensions, just like curvature of spacetime doesn't require extra dimensions.. It's all intrinsically formulated.

3157,"&gt;Can we really say we move relative to cosmic microwave background?


We move relative to the frame where the CMB is isotropic. 

&gt;Does this mean the Eather theories were right?

No? You can't cite some pseudoscience here and expect people to know what it is. Sorry. You'll have to explain what they are, however, the answer is probably still no.

&gt;Could the dark energy be just light in the cosmic microwave background that is in a wavelength undetectable like far infrared?

No, light doesn't gravitate like dark energy (causing accelerated expansion). The universe is also 68% dark energy and only 0.01% radiation (including light). 

&gt;Does the expansion of the universe create/destroy energy or does it keep it the same.

Radiation (including light) is losing energy, so the figure I mentioned above 0.01% is decreasing. The density of dark energy is staying constant, so the total  dark energy is increasing with expansion.

No, these things do not account for each other and it's not like a conversion from one to the other.

&gt;In the video he said that light gets red shifted by the expansion which would indicate it loses energy afaik.

Yes.

&gt;But the mass like galaxies gain energy since their relative speed to each other increases.

Ah well, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to say that, because these galaxies don't even have well-defined velocities relative to each other, only objects that are very close to each other do in spacetime. Here you're trying to assign some sort of kinetic energy between objects that don't have well-defined relative motion.

I'm deciphering that fantastic map myself, I mean, I'm not sure about it, but the overall blue-on-the-left, red-on-the right asymmetry is due to the rotation of the Milky Way.     


The reversed coloring in the central area is (by my interpretation) due to our own position in the disk:  on the right, where the inner blue blotch meets the right-side redness, you can see a ""white wedge""; the Sol is at that distance from the center, and revolving faster than the stars closer to center.  IOW, we are ""catching up"" and ""passing"" the inner stars, while ""lagging behind"" the outer ones.  The direction of the rotation of the galaxy would be such that the stars on the left would be moving ""out of the screen"", and the stars on the right ""into the screen"" (that the image is displayed on).

3196,"This is a massively complicated topic that has no one answer. The evolution of a star in question depends on quite a large number of variables, a non-exhaustive list including mass at formation, rotation, metallicity, and surrounding material of the star, whether that includes other stars in the system or other material. 

Stars under 8-9 solar masses are largely determined to never undergo a supernova event during their normal lifetimes. They ascend the red giant branch, slide onto the horizontal branch, and back up the AGB branch, with many variances depending on the star itself. 

 [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Evolution\_of\_the\_Sun\_2\_EN.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Evolution_of_the_Sun_2_EN.svg)

Stars above this mass *may* undergo a supernova, but the parameters for if a star will undergo a supernova or not is still not set in stone. There are certain mass parameters where a star may just directly collapse and undergo no supernova at all. The physics for this is quite complicated and not quite understood yet, though it is thought to have a correlation with metallicity. 

Stars on the lower end spectrum of the massive stars will evolve into a red supergiant at some point in their lives, but some will undergo blue loops and move back towards the blue end of the spectrum (this having to do with the properties of complicated shell burning and how it affects the outer layers of the star). Whether a star of this type will experience a supernova on the red end or the blue end of the spectrum depends. 

Massive stars also undergo mass loss during their lifetimes which is extremely relevant for all except the lower metallicity stars (such as population III or extremely-metal poor population II). Very generally speaking for a set metallicity, the higher the initial mass, the higher the mass loss. This is due to the radiative properties for extremely massive stars that can easily shed off outer layers of the star. Depending on the type of star, this mass loss can be relatively constant or unbelievably erratic. 

Some stars can become red supergiants, but lose enough mass to lose almost all of their hydrogen envelopes and they move to the Wolf-Rayet part of the spectrum. This is bluewards and for hydrogen-less WR stars, they tend to have a smaller luminosity than normal supergiants (as they have very high temperatures but very small radii). 

Stars massive enough never become red supergiants but stay roughly on the blue side of the spectrum, losing mass most-likely (by not 100% certainty) through a short-lived luminous blue variable phase. Stars of this type may either explode as a luminous blue variable or continue to lose mass to become a massive wolf-rayet star. This is still quite an open field and answers are still extremely fuzzy, with different studies coming to different results. The very most massive-stars can also exist as a type of wolf-rayet that has hydrogen in its spectra but I won't get too complicated. 

The remnant that a star leaves behind depends on mass and metallicity, as well as other variables. It's generally thought stars under 25 solar masses leave neutron stars as remnants, but this is only for solar metallicity. If the star has more metallicity, neutron stars can be formed with higher mass, and vice-versa for less metallicity. Above this, stars mostly form black holes through a variety of ways, including different types of supernova, and as I said, some may not leave a supernova at all and directly collapse to a black hole. 

Some stars with lower metallicity with very high mass (140-250 solar masses roughly) may leave no remnant behind at all and explodes as a pair-instability supernova, tearing the entire star apart. 

Here's just one paper that discusses this and shows some evolutionary tracks (beware, like I said this is still an extremely open field): 

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0611140.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0611140.pdf)

3198,"The most popular consensus is that dark energy may be a property of space itself... this hypothesis provokes the term “vacuum energy”.

It is most certainly not tied to black holes.  Dark energy is everywhere in the cosmos, but black holes are concentrated around clusters of matter.

In fact, this is going to be the fate of 90-99% of the stars in galaxies; they'll eventually ([over a timescale of 10 to 100 quintillion years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_an_expanding_universe#Stellar_remnants_escape_galaxies_or_fall_into_black_holes)) all be thrown out of their galaxies by gravitational perturbations except for the 1-9% that are swallowed by the central supermassive black holes.

Along with the extragalactic stars, there will also be planets, asteroids, comets and dust.

Due to the accelerating expansion of the universe, something kind of interesting (or very, very dull, depending on your perspective) happens to all this stuff that's chucked out of galaxies and galaxy clusters.  As it moves away from the galaxy on it's trajectory, it slows down from the gravity of the galaxy pulling it back, but assuming it's on an escape trajectory, it'll eventually reach a point where it seems to speed up again, with the galaxy getting further away faster over time instead of more slowly.  

By the time the stuff has travelled 16 billion light years from the galaxy, the expansion of the universe has isolated the stuff in it's own observable patch of the universe, forever cut off from it's galaxy of origin by the cosmic horizon so that not even light speed signals can cross the distance and catch up to the galaxy that's now receding from the stuff at greater than the speed of light, and by then all the other galaxies have probably crossed the cosmic horizon too, so the stuff ends up completely isolated in it's own personal observable universe, with just a few neighbouring bits of stuff that will also eventually cross the cosmic horizon, leaving the stuff in an almost perfectly empty universe with nothing but empty void in all directions for as far as far goes and a few very low energy photons being emitted by the cosmic horizon itself.",1603330533,astrophysics,Peter5930,Astrophysics,Comment,336

If gravity is truly a force like the other three known fundamental forces, meaning that it is mediated by a boson (the graviton), then the graviton would have to be a spin 2 boson with no mass of its own. Since gravity is a universally attractive force more mass would mean more gravity which equals more gravitons. Think of it like this: In most cases more mass means more particles of whatever is making up the mass. More particles to emit gravitons to create the force/illusion of gravity. There are reasons to believe both that gravity is a boson mediated force and that it may be a fundamentally different type of phenomenon solely concerned with the warping of space. Pretty much everyone thinks/hopes that gravity will turn out to be another force of the same type as the other three, I mean something very much like gravity just exists withing string theory which was not conceived for that purpose, but we do seem to be stuck in the quest to unify quantum mechanics and General Relativity.",1603296320,astrophysics,chardo137,Astrophysics,Comment,240

But, from my layman's perspective, Dark Matter is not proved to exist, is not nearly as robust as Einstein's gravity.

There is *something* going on with gravity at galactic scales and Dark Matter (some sort of new particle) is far and away the most robust theory.   But no one has found direct evidence of a particle, or predicted something else based on that theory (as far as I know).   There has yet to be any local evidence of the theory (like the orbit of Mercury with Einstein's theory, or particle accelerators with quantum theory). 

  As far as I understand it, the galactic-scale evidence is what leads scientists to theorize Dark Matter, and there is no other evidence yet.   But the galactic scale evidence keeps accruing.

The Dark Matter theory has been around for something like 80  or more years, it's not like someone just noticed the anomalies this decade.  There have been other explanations, like Modified Gravity (MOND) which has been discarded multiple times because it causes too many other complications.

3262,"Just a little particle physics might shed some light on what we think is happening with dark matter ...

As we presently understand the universe, there are 4 forces:

 - gravity
 - electromagnetism
 - strong force
 - weak force

Particles interact with each other via these forces.  But when a particle lacks “charge” for a given kind of force, it is essentially blind to that type of force.  We think that dark matter particles lack both electromagnetic charge and strong charge and so dark matter has almost no capacity to collide with normal matter.  It also does not emit photons (no electromagnetic charge).  In this regard, dark matter particles are both invisible, and ethreal... they mostly pass right through normal matter.  Moreover, dark matter almost never even interacts with other dark matter.

The reason we know that dark matter exists is because it does have mass (gravitational “charge”).  So dark matter does generate gravity and it flows around gravitational wells.  

But because it has no EM or strong force resonance, it cannot experience friction when flowing past regular matter or other dark matter.  As a result, while dark matter does fall into gravitational wells like that around a galaxy, it never really condenses and so it tends to remain as diffuse clouds on a size scale roughly comparable to galaxies.

There is a possibility that dark matter particles may have some ability to resonate with the weak force.  If this is true, this would give it a very rare ability to sometimes collide with a particle of normal matter.  We have yet to verify whether this is the case (there are a number of experiments under way to look for signals that may correspond to such rare events).",1603243709,astrophysics,Captain_Rational,Astrophysics,Comment,288

&gt;Also if we do prove definitively that dark matter exists then would we have to add another elementary particle to the list if so could other Elementary particles that we haven't discovered yet?

3266,"I’m glad you’re interested! I also very much was at your age but had no forums to turn to.

That’s exactly right, the reason you see a black hole’s shadow and not the actual event horizon is because of gravitational lensing. I’d be careful with the analogy because accretion disks are caused by the friction of matter falling into the SMBH. That, per se, is not lensing. A lensed object would be located behind the distortion source (black holes or large masses of matter) and away from its gravitational influence.

Whether you had a large or small mass of dark matter wouldn’t make a difference in terms of visibility, because the “slope” of the dark matter gravitational potential cannot get as steep as a SMBH’s. Dark matter dominates in other ways. For example, in cosmological simulations, if you only used dark matter as your gravitational source, you’d still get a universe with realistic large scale properties. At smaller scales, dwarf galaxies are made up almost entirely of dark matter, with a dark to baryonic matter ratio of 3400 to 1 instead of the cosmic average of 6 to 1.

There are different forms of lensing, btw. You might be interested in learning the difference between strong and weak, for example :)

Edit: yes, the current consensus is that dark matter is a particle beyond the standard model. There are several candidates. WIMPs were the favorite hypothesis, but cross sections of direct dark matter detection methods have all but ruled out WIMPs. Out of the way are also minor models coming from supersymmetry, also ruled out by LHC. WIMP detection is however not a dead field yet, but models such as axions are getting traction — from what I hear from colleagues. Larger candidates like planets or asteroid have been ruled out (look up MACHOs), some adventurous theorists are still trying to make primordial black holes work whether others think they are ruled out along with MACHOs.",1603230160,astrophysics,Oycla,Astrophysics,Comment,326

So arguably dark matter is still ""just a theory"". But that's a phrase that annoys a lot of people in the field, because it seems to trivialise what is still a very well researched area of science - it's not something that only exists in whiteboard scribblings.

But because we don't know what the dark matter particle actually is, we can't say for sure why it doesn't interact with light. But it's by no means unprecedented - only particles that carry an electromagnetic charge do so. So already-known types of particle that happen to be electrically neutral, like the neutron and the neutrino, also don't interact with light.

In fact, one of them (the neutrino) was for a time suspected to be the dark matter. But it turned out that things didn't quite add up, as the distribution of structures in the real universe doesn't match what's produced in computer simulations of neutrino dark matter.

The bullet cluster consists of two galaxy clusters which collided and passed through each other like waves would. Galaxy clusters are immersed into large halos of hot, ionized gas (visible in the X-ray bands — generally depicted in red or purple/magenta). In the Bullet Cluster, you can see that the gas clearly collided and interacted, because gas is baryonic matter subject to friction.

Through gravitational lensing, however, you can map where the bulk of the matter is located (in most pictures, this is represented with a bluish color, or with line contours). Well, the bulk of the matter of each cluster passed through the other, as if “transparent” to the companion. So it seems that the bulk of a galaxy cluster’s mass is made up of a mass that macroscopically is not subject to friction and does not emit light. This is consistent with one of the purported properties of dark matter, namely that it is not subject to electromagnetic forces (both friction and emission of light are electromagnetic phenomena). Not every particle gives off energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.

P.S.: all other galaxy cluster collisions observed so far are consistent with the Bullet Cluster interpretation. There is other observational evidence for the existence of dark matter (CMB, BAO, SNe standard candles, etc.) many of these just as reliable if not more precise than lensing.

This isn't a question at all. It's just nomenclature. Gravity is one of the four fundamental interactions. In newtonian mechanics (which remains accurate for most non-extreme phenomena) it is modelled as a classical force. It's definitely ok to call it force depending on context (maybe not so much in the very specific case where you consider a general relativistic equation of motion for a particle that is under the influence of other forces too). Even with gravitational motion being inertial (force-free) in general relativity, you can still try and quantize the theory (a theory of spin 2 bosons called gravitons which contains GR as a limit case). You can write down a theory of gravitons, even though it breaks down at high energies.

""Dark"" in dark matter doesn't mean we ""can't explain it"" or ""don't know x"". It means we know it doesn't interact electromagmetically.

&gt;Current Physics goes with: Neutrinos do not have mass. It's an ongoing issue, but it may be so so light we can't detect it's mass (for now?).

So we know neutrinos have non-zero mass. As to what their mass is exactly that's not been measured to good  precision. The standard model doesn't contain neutrino masses, which is just one more thing that tells us it is incomplete (dark matter not being covered by the standard model is another thing that tells us we need to expand the model and haven't found all particles that exist yet).

Although, judging on the responses here, I have a feeling that documentary has a different meaning in America (where I assume the other responses are from) than what I am looking for. 

I’ll keep on looking and if I can figure out the American version of what I am looking for I will make another post.

3289,"There are three effects relevant here. The atmosphere does spread out light, as you've noted, and goes away almost entirely in space. The other sensible effect to talk about is diffraction. Light entering the human eye is subject to diffraction because the eye has a limited aperture size. This sets the visual resolution limit of the human eye at ~1/120 of a degree. Anything smaller will look to be the same size. Finally, we have to consider that we have approximated stars as being at infinity. With a large enough telescope (say, one the size of the earth) that approximation breaks down and we can see some structure on the star.

I recommend googling ""resolution limit"" and ""Airy disc"" for more information on how the optical physics works.",1603112119,astrophysics,borkmeister,Astrophysics,Comment,128

The point is that the ""resolution"" of our eyes is one Photon. There is nothing we can see, but Photons, that is the point. But, we can actually see exactly one Photon in an empty, or better dark, space:

The reason here is that at very high densities, the particle's Fermi energy is so much higher than their kinetic energy (which is what we mean when we talk about ""temperature""). Under typical conditions in the laboratory, you reach this condition by cooling the gas, but a second way is to increase the density in a dramatic way (neutron stars are 14 orders of magnitude denser than stuff on Earth). So even though you might think of a neutron star as ""hot"",  temperature effectively drops out of the equation of state because density effects dominate, and so from this point of view, you can treat neutron star matter as if it was very cold (because when comparing the thermal energy with respect to the Fermi energy, they are cold).",1603014241,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,161

First, no object is going to survive all the way to the singularity. Tidal forces will pull the object apart before it gets there. How long before will depend on how large and tightly held together the object is. The sun would get pulled apart before the shuttle, even though they'll both take about the same time to fall.

Second, for object with mass on a similar scale to the black hole, you'll also have to take into account that the black hole will also fall towards the object.

&gt;Does the space inside an atom expand with the universe?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
So, does the existence of dark energy in our accelerating universe mean that space is expanding everywhere, even on small scales such as those inside of an atom, where most of the volume is effectively “empty” space? The short answer is no! And we should all count ourselves lucky that we live in such a universe. Thankfully, the local electromagnetic forces that hold the atom’s positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons together, as well as the strong nuclear forces confining the nucleus, are significantly stronger than the potentially disruptive forces of dark energy.

3443,"&gt;Given that we dont really understand what causes gravity

We do. Check out general relativity. This is a theory that's been repeatedly tested and verified in 100 years of experimental efforts. This is such an accurate understanding of gravity that people struggle to come up with experiments where results would disagree with GR predictions.

&gt;we know gravity is a property of mass

The full stress energy tensor is the source of gravity in GR.. already

&gt;E/c² = m, meaning effectively that E = m (i know thats not how math works but i think you get it)

This isn't that wrong. But E  = mc² says that the energy a massive object has at rest is equal to its mass (times c²) and sometimes in physics we use systems of units where c = 1 and E = m therefore. But you gotta be clear what E means here, it's the energy of an object **at rest**. It's not the total energy (including kinetic).

&gt; Also could dark energy and dark matter be the same thing just disguised as two different features of the observable universe?

They are completely different things. So unless you have a good reason to present to us why they would be the same thing (other than both of them having ""dark"" in their name, that doesn't count), the no.",1602670909,astrophysics,lettuce_field_theory,Astrophysics,Comment,224

3447,"&gt;  Into what? No one knows.

Space isn't expanding ""into anything"". It's not even a question, where you would say ""no one knows the answer"". It's that to have an expanding spacetime you do not need any higher dimensional encompassing space to talk about that expansion. That's the misconception at the basis of people saying ""what is it expanding into"". Then saying ""we don't know"" is equally wrong.

&gt;So, there is Relativistic Length Contraction:

Length contraction has nothing to do with all this. From here you drift off entirely into irrelevant things, including gravitational waves which are also irrelevant to the question.

&gt;So, yes Atoms can be expanded and collapsed, but currently it is not happening. Thankfully.

The question was whether universal (accelerated) expansion  is doing this and the answer is no. It doesn't matter if you can do it by other means (we ionize atoms all the time for instance, it's clear that this can be done, but expansion isn't doing any such thing).",1602670431,astrophysics,lettuce_field_theory,Astrophysics,Comment,165
3448,"This is wrong. Space isn't expanding on these scales. Its only expanding above galactic scales.

&gt;the space between our atoms is always expanding, but any additional distance between our atoms will increase the electrostatic attractive forces between our atoms (decrease the repulsive forces), creating an acceleration that keeps our atoms together.

This isn't how it works.

&gt;In a universe with constant expansion, you might be 10-80 percent bigger than you would be without expansion, but that number is only based on the rate of expansion and fully cancels out the expansion, it doesn't accumulate over time.

This is correct. While the immediately following paragraph

&gt;If expansion keeps increasing infinitely it will eventually become stronger than electrostatic attraction and other forces and cause the 'Big Rip' though.

 is wrong, [with dark energy no such thing happens](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophysics/comments/jac4xc/are_we_all_expanding_all_the_time/g8s6hed/) (and no big rip happens).",1602670046,astrophysics,lettuce_field_theory,Astrophysics,Comment,140
3449,"&gt;To follow on to the comment above, that's how things are now. Local gravity and the electromagnetic force are enough to overcome expansion but it's theorized that this won't always be the case.

This is wrong.  Dark energy doesn't do any such thing. It will always be the case with dark energy. The big rip is not the predicted scenario of the current accepted model.

3451,"&gt;I've heard it said that human beings are in a sort of perfect middle between the great and the small of physical reality

Not really.

This argument is flawed, and basically woo to sell popscience and to get clicks.

The planck size is NOT the smallest size of the unvierse. it's not a universal pixel size or anything. It's the scale where quantum gravity takes over. Its value isn't even fixed, it's just an order of magnitude estimate.

Still between the Planck length (2 · 10^(-35) m) and the size of the observable universe (at the moment!! this is changing with time, and it's also not the size of the universe) (4 · 10^(26) m) the middle point between these two figures is unsurprisingly 2 · 10^(26) m (half the observable universe size). Even if you were to look logarithmically, you still end up at something like 10^(-5) m, from where you need a lot of wishful thinking to arrive at the idea that it could have anything to do with human scales. 

In my view it's a dumb numerological woo ""factoid"" and not physics, but what do I know, I've only studied it. It's not physics.

3485,"&gt;It seems then we are not attached to space because of gravity and electromagnetic forces ( the big and the small), until we aren't and at some future tipping point the expansion of space overrides those forces into the big rip. Is that what it is?

The Big Rip is a possibility, it could however also be many other ""endings"" of the Universe like Heat Death.

Einstein's Relativity explains us Gravity as an effect of bending of Spacetime. According to it, there is no attraction, but we are falling down ([oversimplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttZCKAMpcAo)). That is also probably why compared to the other 3 forces it is ""weak"". Weak meaning Gravity almost plays no role on the Atomic/Subatomic level.

However: Notice the word ***spacetime*** ! Einstein's Relativity specifically says that there is no space. There is also no time. Both time and space are somehow connected to each other. Spacetime. Speed (mp/h ; km/h) is the motion at which an object moves through space in a given time. That is what Special Relativity describes (mostly). It has the Length Contraction and Time Dilation as effects. So somehow time runs slower and you get ""shorter"" the faster you move.

We cannot separate space and time. Space is not the space, the stage where - as does classical ""Newton"" Physics assumes - just everything happens. Time is somehow directly involved and changes the outcome.

If you want a bigger headache, head over to String Theory. [A String in String Theory is at both ends connected to a Brane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC1qYy-RRcE).

3488,"&gt;Yes, a human being as well as paper clips. I guess the question is, are we attached to space?

Yes we are attached to space. I assume you refer here to the fate of the Universe theory called [Big Rip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip)?

&gt;In physical cosmology, the Big Rip is a hypothetical cosmological model concerning the ultimate fate of the universe, in which the matter of the universe, from stars and galaxies to atoms and subatomic particles, and even spacetime itself, is progressively torn apart by the expansion of the universe at a certain time in the future.

Currently the expansion of the Universe doesn't seem to affect us. Space is apparently just expanding. Into what? No one knows.

So, there is [Relativistic Length Contraction](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/specrel/lc.cfm):

&gt;One of the peculiar aspects of Einstein's theory of special relativity is that the length of objects moving at relativistic speeds undergoes a contraction along the dimension of motion. An observer at rest (relative to the moving object) would observe the moving object to be shorter in length.

So we know that Atoms can be stretched or compressed. [This here is how we think an Atom looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMIvWz-7GmU), a small ""core"" of Protons and Neutrons and an hull of electrons. Developed by Schrödinger et al. and this is were Quantum Theory is coming from. You see, there is a lot of space inside an Atom...

More, we know of Supernovas that form Nebulas, White Dwarfes, but also Neutron Stars and of course Black Holes. So all that points us that matter as we see it - even our bodies - are not the constant unchangeable thing that we perceive them to be.

Now we go to Gravitational Waves. These are only currently detectable if there are \_\_massive\_\_ waves, like from 2 merging Black Holes. Such a massive event actually transforms the Earth and everything on it - including you ([exaggerated effect](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/video/ligo20160211v5)). It makes space ""longer"", more separated for a short time.

But no human did notice, it was not in our reference scale.

So, yes Atoms can be expanded and collapsed, but currently it is not happening. Thankfully.

More is here:

&gt;Does the space inside an atom expand with the universe?  
&gt;  
&gt;So, does the existence of dark energy in our accelerating universe mean that space is expanding everywhere, even on small scales such as those inside of an atom, where most of the volume is effectively “empty” space? The short answer is no! And we should all count ourselves lucky that we live in such a universe. Thankfully, the local electromagnetic forces that hold the atom’s positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons together, as well as the strong nuclear forces confining the nucleus, are significantly stronger than the potentially disruptive forces of dark energy.

No. We only know there is gravity because of ***observation***. You really now have to understand, that we do not know ***what*** gravity is. Einstein's Relativity only explains to us the ***measurable effects*** of gravity. Not what it is. This is very important to get into your mind, when you read about ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy""

&gt;Thats where the idea of dark matter came from right? Not dark energy because that drives the expansion of the universe, correct?

Cut the word ""idea"". No one had that ""idea"" and no one really likes it. But that is Science. We measured it, but can't explain it. Hence ""Dark"". Dark Matter and Dark Energy are measurements. We expected - from Einstein's equations - to measure X, but we measured X+N. Simply put: We measured that there is more Gravitational pull then there should be by the amount of ***visible*** objects (stars).

&gt;Theres always a ton of neutrinos flying around in space at super high speeds right.

Current Physics goes with: Neutrinos do not have mass. It's an ongoing issue, but it may be so so light we can't detect it's mass (for now?).

&gt;Given E = mc2 could that energy account for the lost mass? I know im thinking wrong but pls explain why.

Here is the next thing: We don't actually know what E, Energy, actually is. We can - again - measure it - but what is it?

So, I don't know where you want to go with that question. Neutrinos are flying around at the speed of light, they certainly have energy, but that energy was created in our Universe. It is a transformation of Energy A to Energy B.",1602526869,astrophysics,pkarlmann,Astrophysics,Comment,328

Problems I can see with this off they top of my head:

1. Where is the mass for these particles that are pushing everything coming from? The mass of the galaxies doesn't appear to dropping like we would expect if there was some huge stream of particles pushing them.
2. I was kind of getting at this with my other comment: Your whole notion of how the expansion of the universe works is deeply flawed. It can't be explained in terms of Newtonian mechanics. For one thing, [galaxies near the edge of the observable universe appear to be moving away from us faster than the speed of light](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-can-the-universe-ever-expand-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-869d0a3f5f3d), which would be impossible if their apparent motion was being caused by Newton's 3rd law.",1602080427,astrophysics,HanSingular,Astrophysics,Comment,165

-vacuum decay: long story short, it’s theorized to be possible that a point on a quantum field could drop to a lower energy point, and thus expanding outwards from that point, with the whole field changing to the lower energy state expanding outwards at the speed of light. Basically earth, and our entire galaxy would be destroyed, physics would probably change, and you don’t see it coming because it moves at the speed of light. Probably don’t have to worry about this though, would be like 1 in 99999899999999^999999999, maybe higher 

-just thinking about the vastness of space [pale blue dot ](https://youtu.be/-LKghv11Q7Q), this video is one of my favorite videos. Shows the pale blue dot image to scale with our solar system. We are just one of hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, and just one of possibly trillions and trillions of galaxies, all with billions of there own suns.

Initial evidence for dark matter arose when it was calculated that galaxies would fly apart, or had not have even formed at all, if there were not large amounts of unseen matter influencing the ordinary matter.⠀  
⠀  
Dark matter does not appear to interact with electromagnetism – not reflecting, absorbing, or emitting light – and has only been theorised. Although it cannot be seen, astrophysicists the world over are trying to further understand this mystery of astronomy. It is thought that ordinary matter can interact with dark matter only via gravity, and could be an undiscovered elementary particle, such as a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMPs). ⠀

What makes a planet ""better"" than the Earth? Is it its ability to harbor complex lifeforms? How complex can life really be in a completely different system? One thing is for sure, the Earth is the only planet in which human beings are present, because we evolved and grew from it, and its particular planetary characteristics (we are a part of the planet, after all). Therefore, statements such as ""better than earth"" regarding human abitability is just nonsense. And we lack the knowledge to make such a statement as ""better suited for life"" or so, because we just don't know how life can get to be in other stellar systems. Let's then say that some biomarkers were found that may yield high abitability (given our current understanding of the proliferation of life) in some exoplanets. Other thing I've read is that their host star is ""better"" than the sun. What? I mean, why don't they say that those stars are slightly less massive and therefore live for a little longer than the sun? Do a few billion years really make a large difference regarding the growth of life? We just don't know for sure...

3704,"There’s a lot that is wrong here, but i’m going to start with a misconception about the edge of the observable universe. 

The reason there is an edge to the observable universe is the combination of the finite age of the universe, and the finite speed of light. Because light travels only so fast, and the universe is only so old, there is a limit to how far light can have travelled from some place in the universe to reach you in your here and now. That distance is just (time since the big bang) x (speed of light) x (extra factor to account for expansion and whatever). 

The point is that that distance is the same in all directions. And it is also the same for all observers. Everyone sits at the centre of their own observable universe bubbles. 

So if i’m over here, and you’re over there, the edges of our universe are different. If you’re not far away, then the difference is minuscule. But if you’re some decent fraction of the universe away, then there is actually a lot of my observable universe that exists outside your one. 

But neither of us can see anything special about the other’s boundary. It’s just a curiosity, like ... i dunno, a national border or something. We can make it meaningful, but it doesn’t actually exist. 

A black hole is different: it’s a physical phenomenon. If our two universes have a black hole in common, we will agree on its mass, it’s size, and where its boundary is. (So long as we both know about general relativity to account for our different frames of reference, etc.)

This is why the edge of the observable universe is different to the edge of a black hole.",1601894386,astrophysics,doctorBenton,Astrophysics,Comment,294
3705,"Firstly don't knock yourself too hard. Black holes and cosmology are extremely hard topics and the fact that we don't know everything about the Universe should be an indication of that. Your point of view although interesting is based on a few misconceptions. There is an ""edge"" to the universe because of the speed of light. Light travels at c and travels 1 light-year in a year. The Universe is 13.6 billion years old. So the light we can see can only be from that point so 13.6 billion light year away. Now because of other stuff it's actually slightly more but that's the reason there's an edge.  When it comes to black holes, the portal theory although nice isn't really possible because a black hole is a singularity, not really a hole. Hope that helps. Feel free to ask questions like this again it's the best way to learn.",1601894240,astrophysics,Aubin_G,Astrophysics,Comment,150

**Planetary Protection is the practice of protecting solar system bodies from contamination by Earth life** and protecting Earth from possible life forms that may be returned from other solar system bodies. NASA’s Office of Planetary Protection promotes the responsible exploration of the solar system by implementing and developing efforts that protect the science, explored environments and Earth. 

NASA's Planetary Protection policies and requirements ensure safe and verifiable scientific exploration for extraterrestrial life. The main objectives are to

* Carefully control forward contamination of other worlds by terrestrial organisms and organic materials carried by spacecraft in order to guarantee the integrity of the search and study of extraterrestrial life, if it exists.
* Rigorously preclude backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life or bioactive molecules in returned samples from habitable worlds in order to prevent potentially harmful consequences for humans and the Earth’s biosphere.",1601750605,astrophysics,reddit455,Astrophysics,Comment,148

It is absolutely not impossible. Some postdocs I know were in their late twenties when they begun with astronomy from a Bachelors, so it is doable.

&gt;Closest to the black hole, the gravitational light-bending becomes so excessive that we can see the underside of the disk as a bright ring of light seemingly outlining the black hole. This so-called “photon ring” is composed of multiple rings, which grow progressively fainter and thinner, from light that has circled the black hole two, three, or even more times before escaping to reach our eyes. Because the black hole modeled in this visualization is spherical, the photon ring looks nearly circular and identical from any viewing angle. Inside the photon ring is the black hole’s shadow, an area roughly twice the size of the event horizon — its point of no return.

We say we can see back 13 billion years, but weren't those objects that emitted the photons very 'close' to us, because everything was much closer together then? 

The thing that is breaking my brain is how we say that this photon took 13 billion years to get to Earth, but 13 billion years ago the universe was so much smaller, so why did it take 13 billion light years to get to my eyeballs?

3805,"I completely disagree on ""Everything we know about black holes is speculation"". Actually, in the last few years (since the very first gravitational wave detection) our knowledge about BHs has improved quite a lot. I can give you a relatively brief historical summary: 

As they said already in the comments, the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein field equations from general relativity (GR) was the first theoretical work to point out the existence of singularities in said mathematical formalism. The term black hole was not coined until later in the 60s. One of the first **observational** evidences of supermassive black holes came from analyzing the spectra (better: Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) which are basically the very shiny center of large galaxies. They realized that AGN emission could not be explained with stellar emission only, because it was rather different than the SED from all types of stars. Previous theoretical work on accretion onto a compact body (see Bondi and Lytterton works in the 30s and 40s) did predict this type of emission from AGN. This was a first hint into what the hell is going on in galactic nuclei, that emission could only be explained if matter was falling at high (relativistic) speed onto a very massive body.  The next observational breakthrough came with adaptative optics (AO) in the  90s. By studying the Milky Way Galactic Centre (MWGC) in the infrared with high-resolution AO-assisted telescopes, the orbits of individual stars around the MWGC black hole, Sgr A\* were resolved and from their elliptical paths, a central mass of around four million solar masses were calculated. Such a high mass restricted to such a small area, that does not emit light... There's no other explanation than a BH (if you are interested in the papers, check Schödel et al. 2003 and Gillessen et al. 2009 and 2017 although it gets technical). Then the EHT first BH image of M87\* arrived, showing the very first **direct** evidence of SMBH in the Universe. Finally, with the arrival of gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO VIRGO, a whole new range of BH were recently detected, the so called intermediate-mass BH. Having ways to detect these objects might change the astrophysical paradigm which restricted the existence of BH to stellar BH and SMBH. We will see then what future facilities such as LISA have to say about this.

Anyways, this is pretty much a comprehensive tour towards well-established BH evidence. Tons of stuff was left, but it hope this helps.

3832,"&gt; I was under the impression that energy itself was the cause of gravity.

Right.

The total mass of a system is given by its total energy in its center of mass frame. Reduce the total energy (e.g. by emitting gravitational waves or any other types of radiation) and you reduce the mass of the system.

To emit gravitational waves you need masses that get accelerated, the more mass and the more acceleration the better. Only very compact objects (neutron stars and black holes) orbiting each other closely emit gravitational waves with significant power.

&gt; Q1-B) Are the gravitational waves stronger than the normal gravity of the system?

They act differently. If you are close to the black holes you are simply attracted by them and gravitational waves are a minor effect in comparison. If you are far away the gravitational waves are weaker but the direct gravitational attraction gets completely negligible.

&gt; Q1-C) Can the gravitational waves ""push"" at all? Or is it all pull?

&gt; Q2

Neither. They stretch and compress space orthogonal to their direction of propagation. Matter in space follows this.

&gt; Q2-B) Lets say we have a combination event at the distance of the sun. What happens to earth? What happens to Jupiter? What happens to Proxima Centari?

Gravitational wave detectors measure it. A few optics lab setups will measure it because it's so near. That's it. Gravitational waves are an extremely weak effect.  If the merger is between two neutron stars then you get bombarded by radiation and particles, ending life on Earth (and potentially the existence of Earth in general), but that's unrelated to gravitational waves. Of course, life on Earth needs the radiation of the Sun, so you probably don't have anything living on Earth anyway in this scenario.

&gt; Q3) If Gravitation Waves just stretch/shrink space, wouldn't that also redshift/blueshift photons in LIGO/etc?

3833,"To answer 2-B, a gravitational wave causes strain in an object it passes over. This is a stretch in one dimension and a squeeze in another, measured as the ratio of the change in length to the length. I.e., a strain of 0.1 would cause a 1-m sphere rod to stretch or squeeze by 10 cm.

The strain falls off inversely with distance (NOT as the inverse square of the distance like the strength of the gravitational force or intensity of light).

For the GW170817 neutron star merger, the measured strain at Earth was ~10^-22 at a distance of 40 Mpc. In very rough numbers 1 parsec = 10^5 AU, so were the merger at the position of the Sun, Earth would have experienced a strain of 10^-11 (Mpc=10^6 pc), so the size entire Earth would have oscillated by about 10 micron (the diameter of a fine human hair) a few hundred times per second as the waves passed.

Many planets have changed as they are observed again, a different Bayesian network is used, or stellar properties are better determined. Sometimes they easily change by over 1-sigma.

Pre-master: If you've done your undergraduate/Bachelors in physics, but did not really do any astronomy, our university (Leiden) advises you to do a small programme, typically of 1 year, where you cover the most important bachelors courses on astronomy. Requires an undergraduate degree

Masters: If you've done your undergrad/bachelors, you can do your masters. Typically takes 2 years and you need a bachelors/undergrad in physics (+astronomy courses). A US undergrad is fine. Many international students do this

PhD/Doctorate: you need a Bachelor/undergrad + Masters in astronomy/physics to apply for a positiion as a PhD candidate. Research experience is a must, but you do not need many years of experience (I had 2.5 years of experience). This is a PAID position.

Its definitely doable though, so as long as you have strong drive then you'll be fine, even if maths isn't your strong suit.

On a mass losing mass as it radiates energy.  I understand how the sun loses mass -- Fusion of hydrogen into helium results in photos created that carry away the energy.   What I don't understand is how gravitational waves can carry energy, as I understood gravity as a result of mass.  


On Q1B -- What I mean to say, is the effect of the gravitational wave result in a greater force on objects acted on by it than the sum of the gravity of the two bodies creating the wave.

&amp;#x200B;

On Q1C -- Wave in the ocean can couple their energy into things floating in the ocean.  This is one of the analogies I'm trying to close in my head right now.  Can, and how do gravitational waves impart their energy on masses that they move through?

&amp;#x200B;

On Q2: We're able to detect gravitational waves, so their energy is imparted on \*something\*

&amp;#x200B;

On Q2B: I understand this -- But I'm more wondering about how the gravitational waves would effect the rest of the solar system.

3847,"Here’s my understanding in regards to your questions. I’m not an expert nor a PhD researcher nor a professor. Q1: it’s not a solid mass so it can lose mass as time goes unless something is adding mass to it. Our sun for example is losing energy because it is radiating away it’s mass by form of photons and particles like hydrogen. The other masses can and does radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. Even planets like Jupiter is radiating energy which in time does decrease the total energy of the system. Q1B: Gravitational wave and gravity are not the same. Gravitational waves are waves generated by huge massive objects rotating around each other. Imagine two marbles in the water tied to each other by a string and then rotating. You know that there’s going to be a wave propagating from the rotation. That’s like the gravitational wave. Gravity is the attraction of other object to the main object due to the mass of the main object. It’s a vector with direction and value which is not the same as a physical wave moving. 

Q1C: gravitational waves do not push nor pull. Think of it as waves in the ocean. The waves in the ocean does not push or pull, it just goes in one direction which is all directions from the source. 
Q2: Gravitational waves just pass through. Imagine a wave in the ocean and it passes some debris. The debris does not go along with the debris, it just floats up and down as the waves just passes through. 

Q2B : If there were two black holes and they merge where the sun is, now you have one object with less total mass than the two separate objects. If there was a binary black hole and the planets were rotating around it for long time, once they merge the total mass of the resulting black hole is less than the total mass of both blackholes combined. The resulting gravitational waves will just pass through but because the total mass is now smaller, there’s less gravitational attraction to keep the planets and Proxima Centauri in same orbit. Since the gravitational pull is less due to loss of mass, the planets and Proxima Centauri will slowly go further away from the merged black hole.

Such degrees will require college qualifications in physics and maths, although some Universities will offer a foundation year if you have only one or (sometimes) neither. You *might* be able to get onto a job at an observatory working as a telescope operator or support astronomer with just a Master's degree in astrophysics, but if you want to do actual astronomical research then a PhD is almost certainly required, which typically takes 4 years (i've heard this can be much longer in the US). So not counting college maths/physics, it will take about 8 years total before you could realistically start looking at astrophysics research jobs. That said, PhDs themselves also consist nearly entirely of astrophysics research, so you might consider someone doing a PhD as an 'astrophysicist'.

The one about ""certain kinds of changes"" says:

&gt; An isolated non-spinning solid object moving at a constant velocity will not radiate. This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of conservation of linear momentum.

But how can anything in our universe be isolated from gravity, which has infinite range? Any moving object will be getting closer to some other objects and getting further from others, thus the gravitational field between them will always be changing and those changes will be propagating at the speed of light.... Ie gravitational waves.

So while it may be lossless in the entire system, it certainly seems like energy is leaving the locality of the moving object.

Perhaps the answer in seeking is in the stress energy tensor thing.... But that's a bit beyond me in first reading. I'll have another go at that.

You curve the spacetime, but your mass/energy is not decreasing because of that.  You can think of the curved spacetime of a system its gravitational field:  now, gravitational waves are emitted by [certain kinds of changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Sources) of that curvature, that field.  So strictly speaking, a black hole, for example, isn't the source of gravitational radiation in the same sense that the Sun is the source of sunlight:  the black hole isn't ""radiating"" as such, but instead the energy that is ""lost"" comes from the field itself (ie. from a much larger section of space than the event horizon, for example).

As for your question:

1) it was incoherent: you mention two random things, suggesting VAGUELY a connection but not putting any effort into further explaining it, only leaving people to guess

3979,"Maybe, but NASA is putting lots of their observational data online you can use from home.Ask the professor if he/she is using this data and can you help from home. 

For example, Sungazer uses SOHO data about the Sun. Amateurs have been using this data to discover asteroids crashing into the Sun. This not what the data was intended to do, but these amateurs were discovering so many of these asteroids NASA had to sit up and take notice. So NASA created the Sungazer Project. 

This video explains Sungrazer history starting at 23 minutes.

3980,"When we consider the connections that all species on earth have to the planet, Humans as well, it is clear that they would change. For example, sleep periods on earth are synchronized with the rotation of the planet. Female reproductive cycles are closely aligned to lunar cycles. Many species change color with the seasons, (Snow shoe rabbits). birds move north and south with the seasons and their mating cycles, nest building, and juvenile development all coincide with seasonal cycles. 

These are but a tiny example of the connections to the earth, moon and sun that species on earth share. If science was not so willingly ignorant of energetic influences we would recognize many more. Like, the earth's electric currents, and Schumann Resonances. 

It is clearly the fact that any species relocating on another planet and in another solar system would transform and probably quite rapidly.",1600533425,astrophysics,SoaringEagle56,Astrophysics,Comment,145

3991,"Space is infinite and yet it still expands since you can sort of always make infinity bigger. This is really tricky to understand so it helps to have an example.

Imagine a hotel with an infinite hallway and an infinite number of rooms. Every single room is full yet someone new needs a room to stay in. How can they fit in?

Well, since the corridor is infinite there will never be someone without a neighbour and so it's possible for every single person to move down a room and there will be then an empty room at the start for the new guy.

The universe is much the same. Space itself is expanding rather than the entire universe just growing. Imagine two dots on the surface of a balloon. As you blow up the balloon, the surface expands and the dots appear to move away from each other yet they're both technically in exactly the same place they always were.

Combine the balloon example with the infinite hotel and you have a decent springboard to get a basic understanding of this stuff from.",1600505537,astrophysics,NedHasWares,Astrophysics,Comment,184
3992,"From your post history it looks as if you mean accretion disk coronae. This is a bad name for a hot plasma that is responsible for producing the hard X-rays seen in the spectra of accreting black holes. There are two basic explanations, which depend on the as of now unknown location of the corona. One answer here is that the corona is thought to form through the magnetorotational instability (MRI), a magnetohydrodynamical effect caused by differential rotation in the accretion disk. Wikipedia has a good explanation of this effect. The MRI causes magnetic reconnection that heats the skin of the accretion disk, forming the corona. In other words: this places the corona around the accretion disk. The alternative explanation is that the corona is related to the existence of a jet, and that it might be consistent with the basis of the jet. Again, electrons are accelerated here and that could cause the thermal plasma that produces the hard X-rays.

For the past 25 years people have tried to find out which of these two models is correct (the buzzword in the business is ""sandwich versus lamppost""). Spectroscopy alone doesn't do it, so people are looking whether one can find signatures in the variability of the systems to deduce the geometry.

4001,"Given enough time and separation then yes, it's very possibly, in fact near certain the colonists on another planet would start to diverge from those still on Earth, but that also assumes thst the colonists and those on Earth can't freely travel between the planets in a relatively short time span. If it was a one way trip to the new planet (for whatever reason) then the colonists would become a new species (rather than race), if they survived the trip, the landing, the planetary environment and the many other challenges. 

If however, interplanetary travel was/became fairly regular and (inter)breeding continued between humans on both planets then it's unlikely the colonists would become a new species, beyond the adaptions to the environment (again, assuming generations lived on the new planet), as seen here on Earth with people from different places having adaptations to the environment. 

Skin pigmentation is one good example of this adaptation, where white (pale) skin tone evolved so more sunlight could be absorbed to for vit D production, where as dark skin evolved to block more sunlight so the dsrk skinned people didn't get too much sunlight. Dark skin is a disadvantage at higher latitudes, whereas pale skin is less of a comparative disadvantage, especially as we have suntan lotion. 

So, short answer (tldr) to the question. It depends, yes if the colonists are cut off from Earth for long enough (many 10s to 100s of thousands of years so interbreeding is no longer possible), to an extent if travel between still happens occasionally and unlikely if travel between is pretty regular.",1600483563,astrophysics,FireNIceFly,Astrophysics,Comment,265

4007,"Take a lot of science and math courses. If you’re in the US, take AP/IB physics and calculus to show colleges that you’re interested in the subject. I would also volunteer at any observatory or something of that nature to show your love for astronomy. There’s also an astronomy Olympiad im pretty sure. 

During high school there are also internships available esp for NASA. The competition is tough tho so make sure you have a good GPA and letters of recommendation. Idk if you can apply yet cuz I think it may be for sophomores or juniors and above. I’m not sure you’ll have to look into it. You could also start an astronomy or astrophysics club. 

After high school, you could major in astrophysics or do a double major with physics and astronomy. A bachelor’s degree won’t cut it usually so you’re gonna have to go to graduate school for a masters but a PhD looks better. PhD takes 4-6 years to complete. That’s 10 years of schooling maximum after high school. 

I’m a freshman astrophysics major and I can understand what you’re going through. Where I lived, there wasn’t much opportunity for that astronomy aspect offered at my school or in my city generally. For college apps, just make sure that you’re heavily science orientated. Then again, you’re a freshman and this might change so make sure to keep your options open and don’t close off any doors just yet.

4078,"You know, if our ideology hadn't been that majuorily urban, uniform, and massive, you could imagine that instead of generations evolving over concrete - just exaggerating for pragmatism's sake - there could have been examples of extreme adaptation to ""strange"" environments.   
That's one of my beliefs - that sooner or later, the hype of superficial culture will have to exhaust, and people will want to *belong* with a land, and develop intimate relationships with their environments, cultures that go beyond isolating communities within cities, towns or villages. *If* eventually, some hypothetical trend would blossom, generating such experimental micro ideologies, aiming for a *blending in* of ""communities"" or people within some environments, who know how they could evolve, how fast and with which progression, relating to environmental conditions?   
As it turns out, I've read about some tribe who have developped decent underwater vision - not perfect, but it seemed they were okay with underwater vision. On the genetic side of things, I'm pretty sure I read about a people in India who've been vegeterians for generations and developped genes coding for digestive enzymes that aren't common to omnivore eastern diets and help break down more vegetable substances... Yet again, tbh with you, I don't record these things anywhere, they're just memories of articles I read and weren't defending any crazy political agenda, it was just genuinely unbiased science articles.  
Of course, these aren't extreme examples of evolution, but just like the dolphin once was a land mammal, you coudl extrapolate, and estimate that if, over the course of x generations, some humans decided to expose themselve to conditions that require metabolic, and maybe physiological differences to justify their survival, well... The one obstacle between now and then is how interfering, or supportive, artificial resources would be to the organic change.  
Of course, you could consider there's enough hatred and stupidity in the world as it is with people raging over different skin colours; and the thought of how people'd react to crazy hippies going on to defend webbed feet and gills or furry, cold braving humanoids as inheritants of the ""human race"", investing in the cruel fate of exposing theirselves to the discomfort and challenge of meeting the elements could be discouraging enough to opt instead for the artifical solutions - diving equipment, or a coat and mittens - but all things considered....  
In my opinion, my humble opinion, that kind of organic and biologic diversity would be a great benefit to humanity. Not to mention the cultures that would develop subjacently, and most importantly the formidable recognition of ambitions that surpass those of the immediate present - if you're ready to invest yourself in development of a culture *that* divergeant, which most likely would be frowned upon by today's global ideological uniformalism and generally rigidly fixed anthropocentric values - not to mention how unaccessible such a coherence would be through lack of present structures and relevance with the mindsets we'e been inheriting - your success would depend on developing a ""*home land*"" in ways that are more discreet and intricate than what is generally common nowadays, and more public too. It's interesting to speculate that that kind of devotion would be an important factor in developping a relationship that is both cognitively rewarding, and enventually could favor symbiotic relationships yet ordinarily unexploited.  
We're starting to witness the premise of this with initiatives such as permaculture, or environmental engineering, but to involve the freedom, of those who would be willing to involve themselves, in such an enterprise as would be the one that commits to trade the common potential for freedom they have for an experiment of freedom that would yield results that extend beyond those that we would grasp immediately, well...

No.  Rest energy is the ""manifestation energy"" of a field excitation.

In practice, it's more complicated, f.e. the production process must respect the conservation of energy, momentum and quantum numbers.  But that's what rest mass is, kind of: the mass corresponding to the energy that allows (or even necessitates, in some cases) the ""existence"" of an electron, in this case.

Potential energy is an abstract concept that can be applied in a virtual infinity of physical systems, those involving the invariant mass/energy relation included.  It is not however ""special"" with respect to it.",1599986087,astrophysics,ketarax,Astrophysics,Comment,145

Finally, after a while, if you are feeling like you are getting more comfortable with the terminology and the concepts, a book good to read would be ""Until the End of Time"" by Brian Greene.

For the podcast side, try listening to StarTalk by Neil deGrasse Tyson as he does a very good job of making it beginner friendly. He often posts every day and at the moment, he has a lot of content you can learn from.

As far as I understand it, he's really arguing against the possibility that everything we call dark matter is really ordinary baryonic matter that hasn't formed stars or any other structures we could see. The argument is that most helium (and a few other light isotopes) in the universe, particularly in the time period measurable from the CMB, formed from big bang nucleosynthesis, that is, nuclear fusion occuring in the first few minutes after the Big Bang. With theoretical calculations, we can predict how much helium you'd expect to see in the primordial universe as a function of the density of baryonic matter (ie non-special matter that participates in nuclear fusion). If dark matter was really baryonic matter and therefore participated in nuclear fusion, we would expect to see much more helium in the early universe than we actually do.

Post PhD because of the uncertain overall outlook to get a position combined with the need for (intercontinental) moves every 2-3 years, and once one has a professorship because of schedules like the ones that I indicated (plus the tenure pressure at universities in countries with tenure track systems. So, yes, the job is not something for people who want a decent work-life-balance, work essentially is life, and this also puts lots of stress on relationships.

On the plus side I always tell people that I'm getting (very well) paid for my hobby and a lot of the stress is self-made (I \*do\* want to get grants because I \*do want\* students to think about the scientific ideas I have...), and the flexibility offered by the job is well worth it.

Teaching goes down, and I've about 30h or so to work with my students (same as during teaching time, but more intense), the rest of the time is spent on grant or observing proposal writing, or work on committees that don't stop during the breaks, and collaboration work. I might even have a few hours per week to do some research on my own...

But I hope you can understand what I mean, the elliptical thing we saw was to the side of that thicker part of what common people would call the milky way. Outside of that belt where you see the most stars and maybe some dust, there are other constellations &amp; planets.

I ""believe"" that wasn't too far because what we saw ""covered"" the view of what was in the sky before it expanded, how can I know for sure I absolutely do not. 


The question really is, besides what I can't really say... do you know any comets that would look green? Is that possible? Do you know of anything that could disappear in 10 minutes? Is there anything green that looks like that in 1997? Could it be a satellite falling, could it be a meteorite? That could be observed by naked eye at the equator that year?

4337,"Hi, I'm sorry, we're observing it by naked eye, no instruments. I was hoping that something a bit more known happened at the time and it was a simple answer.  It's hard for me to know which details are relevant but I will try.

I will try to describe it better. 

From start to finish it lasted about ,10 minutes.
First there was a round ball of yellow light like it was coming towards us growing bigger, . It appeared to the side so parallel to the strip that is the milky way. I say this because what we were seeing was not related to the milky way.  It was happening to the side but close to it.
This smallish yellow ball that started off very small, smaller than the size you see the sun/moon. It started to expand into a bright green elliptical, with some bright spots in the middle but the circle was quite big, much bigger than anything we had ever seen, I'd say from one tip to the other you could easily line up about 5x the moon that we saw that day. As for how far it wasn't happening close to us, at least it was at the highest layers of the atmosphere, not as far as any stars or the moon. If that makes any sense the stars were behind it and not in front.

At the time we stopped everything we were doing to look. It's really hard to describe what that light looked like but it looked like a smoke that somehow produced light and as it grew bigger it's edges became irregular. And started to disappear and dissipate.

This elliptical shape had an outer ring that was very shinny, and the middle less so except for a few spots within. 
 
It was visible about a 10 minutes, it started to fade and it never appeared again. It started as yellowish quickly becoming green. 

It was definitely something that pretty much scared us, but we couldn't stop looking,

It's no surprise that most assistant profs are somewhere in their early to mid 30s. 

Now, you can argue that this is too long, and I agree with you, but from the point of view of hiring committees, it's a fact that getting 50+ applications for an entry level professorship is normal. which then means that they will concentrate on people who are more experienced, which again means that in order to get hired you need significant postdoctoral experience.

I think the best recipe for a successful PhD is to see this as a phase where you can do what you *really* want, and also to test out what being an academic means for you.  In addition, an astrophysics PhD also provides you with a skill set that means that committing a few years to it is pretty much risk free, since you're essentially guaranteed to get a job later (and this is also true for the US, even though one reads many complaints here, the fraction of unemployed astrophysics PhDs is very small and the fraction of astrophysics PhDs with non-academic jobs that guarantee a good life in the upper middle class is close to 100%).

In other words: If you mainly see doing a PhD as a pathway to a professorship, then you're setting yourself up for a disappointment, since a) the probability that you won't make it is very high and b) being an academic and researcher is all but just another profession, it is a style of life that requires a commitment that many people are able to make for a few years (and really enjoy it), but might not want to live not for their whole professional life.",1599211700,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,221

4398,"Surprisingly, the answer to your question#1, thanks to Dark-Energy, is that the universe is actually manufacturing new grid ""squares"" of space-time-fabric (aka: space-time-continuum), constantly. 

So if you imagine the universe as a sidewalk, then between each sidewalk square, dark-energy actually manufactures a new sidewalk square, effectively doubling the distance between 2 objects on that sidewalk each manufacturing cycle. 

--------------------------------

NOTE: as a side-effect: 

This then produces the optical-illusion that distant objects are speeding/moving away from us faster than light.

But in reality the objects themselves are not moving faster than light inside the universe, but rather the universe itself, is manufacturing and making more of itself, aka: squares of space-time. 

So the universe is literally manufacturing new distance between all objects. 

That then effectively places those really-far-away objects further away from us, as if they were moving faster than light. 

--------------------------------

What's more (and this is the highly depressing part) the rate that universe is manufacturing new squares of distance between all objects, seems to be speeding up. 

------------------------------------

So in the end... to answer your question: 

Space-time-fabric is actually not ""stretching"". 

Rather, new space-time-fabric is being created and manufactured somehow, by something mysterious called ""Dark Energy"".

The big bang was not light. The big bang is the coming down and expanding of the universe from a hot and dense early state.

This isn't a relationship between light and matter. You are confusing many concepts with each other here.

E is energy. Not light. m is mass. Not matter. 

E = mc² does not apply to light at all. It's the energy a massive particle has at rest.

No. obviously it takes time to send it away and you can't turn see further back into the past than the moment you send it on its journey.. let alone dinosaurs.

4460,"&gt;So, according to special relativity, as you move faster time slows down.

It's important to be accurate about this. It is moving clocks that tick at a slower rate. 


&gt;And as we humans live out our existence on Earth we are constantly traveling through space at mind blowing speeds.

In some frame yes. In the frame of some fast neutrinos maybe. However the relative velocities between stars and in the galaxy in general are not relativistic at all. They are very low compared to the speed of light. 


&gt;Depending on where on Earth you are standing you are traveling up to approximately 1000mph as a result of the Earth’s rotation.

&gt;As Earth orbits the Sun we are traveling at approximately 67,000mph.

&gt;And the Earth is being towed along by the Sun as it orbits the super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way moving at a speed of approximately 515,000mph.


All these velocities are irrelevant for relativistic effects. 

&gt;Just the idea that we are traveling at those speeds and can’t even perceive it as beings without instruments

There is no absolute motion so you cannot perceive that at all, and you can with equal right claim you are simply at rest. Again there is only relative motion. There is no absolute motion and there is no ""one true velocity an object has"". 


&gt;and mathematics is very humbling but even more so when I think about what the theory of special relativity says about time and velocity.

4463,"Theoretically you're correct. If you pointed a telescope at where the earth used to be 65 million years ago you would see the dinosaurs. Practically however this isn't possible. Firstly you would have to build a telescope that could observe animals on the surface of a planet that is 65 million light years away, something were nowhere near currently and then you would have to send that telescope to 65 million light years. The problem is that, firstly the furthest object we've sent into space has only just now left the solar system and secondly since we can't send objects faster than light you'll never be able to get to a point where you can receive light from the dinosaurs since it'll take you at least 65 million years to get to that point and by then the light you will receive will be from when the telescope was launched.

Can you confirm my understanding - black holes  have LESS mass than the stars they originally were. But it's the AMOUNT  of mass that makes it a black hole (b/c, gravity). So it's actually the STAR... that  is, it's the CONSTANT, ENORMOUS, billion-year-long continuous nuclear  fusion reaction that's keeping it from being a black hole - it was the  power of that fusion reaction that overcame, that was MORE POWERFUL than  the gravity of its mass, powerful enough to be perpetually expelling out light,  energy &amp; matter DESPITE its mass/gravity.   


But in the same way a match burns down to a  cinder because it runs out of burn-able wood (becomes un-burnable  charcoal), the star burns (fusions) its hydrogen into other  non-fusionable atoms until after billions of years it runs out of  hydrogen and the reaction stops. At which point all that's left is the  ""cinder"" of non-fusionable atoms that were (in the core of the star,  while it was burning) continuously compacted together by the mass of the  star. But the force of a black hole is gravity, and gravity is a  function of mass and mass is a quality of matter, and matter is atoms  (the destruction of atoms, fission, turns matter into energy - e=mc\^2),  then a black hole cannot actually ""collapse into an infinitesimally  small point"" because it wouldn't be physical matter with gravity ""so  strong not even light can escape it"". So in reality a black hole MUST be/have  a physical body, right? The gravity of a black hole cannot possibly be  so strong as to pull atoms apart, because then it wouldn't have any  mass...?

4493,"1. Hard work is a part of it, but a lot of success within science and math comes from adapting a growth mindset over a fixed mindset imo. A fixed mindset is telling yourself that because you have no experience or bad experiences with a subject, then you’ll always be “bad” at the subject. Simply that is not true, anyone can succeed in STEM programs if they have a growth mindset. A growth mindset is recognizing you are capable of learning and succeeding in subjects even if they first come off as difficult for you. Also sometimes it takes other people different ways/longer time to learn something that somebody else can learn instantly. That’s totally fine, everyone is on their own academic journey and learning within a STEM field isn’t a race or a competition.

2. Astronomy isn’t too hard of a subject to pursue if you have this level of interest in it. Any program you want to learn more about will become easier to study because you’re more inclined to learn it.

When the primordial gas cooled, gravitational collapse eventually led to the formation of these rather simple (metal-poor in the jargon) stars, which were in general very massive (more than 50 solar masses). Massive stars live relatively short time, and within their core, heavy elements up to iron are formed from nuclear fusion. The existence of heavier elements than Fe in the Universe can only be explained with more energetic processes such as supernovae, which are the final shout of very massive stars.

4530,"Yes. We have evidence that this happens. (I'll focus on accretion disks in binary systems and not those around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies.) Stellar winds from O and B stars are accelerated through the UV radiation of the star itself. In an accretion disk, some of the wind can be driven by heating from the central accreting source, which may give off a lot of X-rays. Also the same mechanism that works with O and B stars may work with the accretion disk, which may also emit very strong UV radiation.

You can check out the theoretical work of Dr. Daniel Proga:

[http://www.physics.unlv.edu/faculty/Proga.html](http://www.physics.unlv.edu/faculty/Proga.html)

Some of the clearest evidence for stellar winds is through UV ""P Cygni"" profile combination emission and absorption spectral lines. We see those in some accretion disk systems. Also sometimes the accretion disk can get eclipsed by a donor star in a binary, and we can still see some remnant gas that we think flowed off the disk in a wind.

We're not sure in general if this gas reaches escape velocity and how much leaves the star system, but the disk is usually continuously replenished by gas flowing from the donor star in the binary system.",1598502516,astrophysics,Schmucko,Astrophysics,Comment,204

4536,"What do you mean ""occur on an accretion disk""? 

From what I know about it, the stellar wind (solar wind) ""blows"" away material in accretion disks when the star is born. 

What I mean by that is the material in accretion disks slowly attract each other and starts forming the planets and stars in the system. When the material forming the star compacts enough due to gravity's pull, the star essentially jump starts and is, in some sense of the word, born. When this happens, the solar wind from the new star starts pushing away the material in the accretion disk out to distance we call the Oort cloud, exposing large bodies (like planets).

4573,"&gt;Hi, I'm trying to understand the interaction between mass curving space-time and Euclidean geometry. My background is mechanics and electrophysics in college for my comp sci degree, and an enthusiastic layperson for relativity and astrophysics. I've watched a lot of PBS space-time on YouTube. 
&gt;
&gt;So here's what has me stumped. Euclidean 2D geometry works in a flat plane. But in the gravity well of earth, space-time is curved. Don't recall if mass creates positive or negative curvature. But if curvature is positive, the 2D plane becomes effectively spherical, in which case the circumference of a circle would be shorter than its radius would give in a flat plane. If curvature is negative, the plane becomes saddle like, and the circumference of a circle becomes longer than the radios gives on a flat plane.
&gt;

For example, I was originally thinking about a case like in the Parker Solar Probe mission where the goal is to reach the Sun and so it has 7 speed reducing gravity assists with Venus to lower its perihelion. In this case I was thinking how applying a thrust at the closest approach from Venus might reduce the number of assists needed.

Let's say for the argument that we have enough fuel per mass to generate a change in velocity that can reduce the number of needed assists to 3 (probably not possible but anyway). Then I was wondering what would be more efficient: to apply all the thrust at the 3rd assist, or to apply 1/3 on the first, 1/3 on the second and 1/3 on the third where we are further slowing down the entrance velocities into each assist such that the gravity assists also get more efficient in reducing the perihelion (gravity assists are located close to aphelion). 

Whereas, for the case where we burn all fuel at the 3rd assist we are burning more fuel at a faster speed so we would get more out of the Oberth effect.

Lasers are not magic, diffraction applies to them as well. 5 years of constant acceleration to 10% light speed ends at 1/4 light year distance. Focusing on a 10 km target needs a laser with a primary mirror of ~100 km even under ideal conditions.

4670,"Okay, Why send an entire Stanford torus.  Its a terrible shape (what orientation) and if you have read the actual study that the Stanford Torus was detailed in, the ring is two layers, the actual habitation volume and then a non-rotating structure composed of regolith (rock) to provide radiation shielding.

A human lifetime--you've not said what that is, but lets say 70 years.  So acceleration, coast, deceleration. All within the acceleration loads that a the torus could handle

Also, you propose a light sail. using lasers.  How reflective is the sail you propose, and more importantly, what is the mass of the sail you propose.

How do you prevent your lasers from frying the habitat?

Why not just use the Daedelus for the entire project? This is what that proposal was designed for. I'm referencing [https://www.universetoday.com/15403/how-long-would-it-take-to-travel-to-the-nearest-star/](https://www.universetoday.com/15403/how-long-would-it-take-to-travel-to-the-nearest-star/)

*Relying on current knowledge of fusion technology and existing methods, the study called for the creation of a two-stage unmanned scientific probe making a trip to Barnard’s Star (5.9 light-years from Earth) in a single lifetime.*

*The first stage, the larger of the two, would operate for 2.05 years and accelerate the spacecraft to 7.1% the speed of light (o.071 c). This stage would then be jettisoned, at which point, the second stage would ignite its engine and accelerate the spacecraft up to about 12% of light speed (0.12 c) over the course of 1.8 years. The second-stage engine would then be shut down and the ship would enter into a 46-year cruise period.*

*According to the Project’s estimates, the mission would take 50 years to reach Barnard’s Star. Adjusted for Proxima Centauri, the same craft could make the trip in* ***36 years*** 

Assume that there is asteroidal material at the other end.  (better yet, instead of a solar system wide laser network, build a solar system wide telescope network for the needed resolution)

The deceleration stage arrives and deploys Von Neumann probes that within a reasonable amount of time mine the native asteroids and construct first more probes, and then factories, which produce both the components and materials for your Stanford Torus.

Next the deceleration stage deploys the (frozen) colonists, or with sufficiently advanced 3d printing, makes their clones.

You do not have to bring a Stanford Torus to Proxima Centauri.  Seriously.  The Stanford Torus was predicated on a lunar base manufacturing the structure and components for it.  If you wish to stay in the spirit of the Stanford Torus, you would build it there, not ship it.",1597799692,astrophysics,EvilWooster,Astrophysics,Comment,415

Distance and final speed -&gt; we need an acceleration of a = 17 m/s^(2).

10,000 km^2 give us P = 10 TW to work with, that means we can accelerate a mass of P/(ac) = 2.0 tonnes. That's not a Stanford Torus, that's a car.

4676,"Large orbiting solar collectors would likely harness the energy needed to power the lasers. If several dozen solar collectors, each several miles across and equipped with there own lasers, all focused there power on this one light sail, it may be able to generate the necessary power needed to push this spacecraft to relativistic speeds. The lasers only need to be as powerful as sunlight on Earth if I'm not mistaken. If the spacecraft has a constant acceleration from the radian pressure felt at 1 AU, how long would it take to reach 10% the speed of light?? BTW I am terrible at math, and am only in high school. There are so many variables in calculating something like this. First of all 99% of the Stanford Torus's mass comes from the millions of tons of lunar dust used as radiation shielding. Since weight is so important when using light sails, I don't know if the radiation shielding would be worth the extra weight. I don't know how necessary it is. The weight of the torus will also determine how large our daedalus needs to be. Once we've figured that out how heavy both our torus and daedalus will be, we need to figure out how big the light sail needs to be. If we use sunlight alone, the light sail will need to be hundreds of thousands of miles across, which is far too large. If we use lasers, which give a constant acceleration regardless of distance to the sun, then the light sail could probably be a lot smaller. How much smaller? I don't know, I couldn't calculate that if I try.

Beginners may think of it as speculation or the popular highlights, but even theoretical astrophysics as a day to day job goes along very closely with observations. Your job is to use tools of physics and math, programming simulations. As you start an apprenticeship, you might be given a computer program written by a more established astrophysicist and work to improve it.  You could be looking at gas flows, at how light and atoms affect what we see from stars, gas between stars, gas from dying stars, how stars are born, how galaxies evolve, how they collide, how different populations of stars change over time or based on environment, layers of stars, the black holes in centers of galaxies: how they grow, affect their galaxies, etc. etc. Or cosmology, where your work may be related to ripples in Big Bang radiation, relating that to dark matter, dark energy, testing ""inflation"", etc. Or supernovas, trying to understand exactly how they explode. Or gravitational waves, where you study different kinds of collisions It's a HUGE subject full of possibilities.

4795,"This doesn't ""break current astrophysics"". I think you have misinterpreted it. Contrary to what the title might suggest this paper is not proposing something that could explain cosmological redshift without expansion. 

Fig 2 in the paper shows clearly that the shifting is dependent on the wavelength of light in question, but the redshift that is observed between galaxies is constant with wavelength. The effect also only depends on the local properties upon emission, so even if this effect is real it cannot explain the correlation between redshift and distance. That is the most fundamental observation to explain. So this is not does not replace the expanding universe or the big bang. 

If you read the conclusions it makes it even more clear that the author is not proposing a mechanism which could explain cosmological redshift, it's a very specific proposal.

4805,"While a lot of people here try to push physics or physics with astro-specialization programs, I want to provide a different perspective.

If you go through the two programs, you'll see that the astro program covers all the same courses, in terms of physics and math, as the actual physics program. The major difference is that some of the 'SBC' courses are removed - it's not completely clear to me what these are but they seem to be some kind of breadth requirement, so they shouldn't really affect physics/astronomy portion of the degree.

A typical astronomy/astrophysics degree, which this program looks to be, covers all the fundamental physics and math that a physics degree does: you get no particularly stronger grounding in the fundamentals from a physics degree. The biggest difference is generally the absence of some of the higher level, more specialized physics courses. So astrophysics programs typically miss out on courses like advanced quantum physics, plasma physics, advanced lab courses, advanced stat mech, laser and solid state physics, etc. Unless you end up doing work in one of those areas, missing those courses isn't really a major problem. In compensation, you get the astrophysics courses that introduce the specialized knowledge relevant to doing astronomy work. Not all of it is necessarily relevant (e.g., you maybe don't need an ISM course if you're working to work on stars), but the same could be said for many of the advanced physics courses.

So in the end, it kind of comes down to considering the future possibilities that interest you. If you want to be an astrophysicist, by which I mean doing a PhD in astrophysics, then having an astrophysics degree is generally preferable because it will give you more knowledge relevant to the work. A professor looking to take on a new grad student will probably prefer one with an astro background to a non-astro background, all other things being equal. But an astrophysics career is kind of a gamble: a lot more people want one than can have one; each stage of career progression is very 'leaky', with many people leaving to find other careers.

So if having an astro degree is better for an astro career, does that mean physics is better for those people who end up getting other careers? It's not clear to me, but I've not seen any particularly convincing arguments for this. A physics degree would make you more qualified for a broader range of physics research, so it might give an advantage in terms of pivoting from an astro career to a physics career (at the cost of giving you a slightly weaker application for astro PhD programs). But I'm not sure there's any difference for non-research careers. The core skill-sets: problem solving, data analysis, mathematical modeling, etc., are shared between physics and astrophysics degrees, so there's no particular reason to expect a major difference in terms of pursuing alternative careers such as finance, data analysis, software development, etc.

For context: I did a dual physics-astrophysics undergrad (starting in astrophysics, then picking up the extra physics major because I was interested in the extra courses). So I'm basing my comments on a comparison of the physics and astrophysics programs I went through.  I am now a postdoc in astrophysics. I've worked with many people with physics BSc backgrounds, and many with astrophysics BSc backgrounds. Despite what many people here say, the people without astrophysics backgrounds had to work to pick up that background during their PhDs, and they came out of their PhDs with a weaker knowledge of the breadth of astrophysics. I'd expect the converse to happen when people with astrophysics backgrounds try to get into physics research (I have a friend who went from astro undergrad to medical physics MSc - a large enough jump that he had to work hard to make up the difference).

Some of the other answers seem to be predicated on the idea that an astronomy program is not going to properly teach physics. The programs you linked disproves that idea, so I think you can ignore those comments.

TL;DR: If you an astrophysics job, get an astrophysics degree. You get almost all the same physics, plus all the astro. If you want a physics job, get a physics degree.

4806,"Yes, that's perfectly fine. Contrary to what you are saying, arXiv.org is not the Cornell University website, Cornell (and many other universities) just operate the preprint server for the community. In principle everybody is allowed to submit papers there - that's exactly what I mean by 'not peer-reviewed'. In other words: just because something appears on arXiv does not yet say it's been vetted by the community. And this vetting is exactly the point of arXiv. ArXiv has some slight filtering in case to week out spam, but that's it. Which is fine (because after all the primary goal of arXiv is to submit ideas and papers to professionals in the field, and who are therefore well versed in separating facts and fiction).

As to the rest: The author here might be associated with the National Aviation University, Kiev, but, well, this does not mean that he is doing active research in atomic physics in higher electron density environments and, in fact, he is not listed on the faculty web pages of the department of general and applied physics there (which are from 2010, so that's perhaps not a strong statement).

4809,"I did a physics major that had something like a specialisation in astro, and am now an astro PhD.

I'd say go for the same path I did: physics with a concentration (maybe a minor) in astro.

The reason is that astronomy is mostly just physics, and often not the particularly *hard* parts of physics either. I do a lot of work with MHD which people often complain is very hard, but it's really just some coupled DEs. The equations themselves aren't hard at all, what makes the topic difficult in astronomy is that it's mixed with historical context. It's the ""field standards"" and *operational* problems in a fast-moving and chaotic field that's hard to manage. And that's generally true of a lot of astro subjects: most of the astro-specific knowledge is historical knowledge, definitions that were made 50 years ago for arbitrary reasons which you now have to memorise.

You can teach yourself all of the astro-specific information in relatively little time without any formal classes. You can't do the same with physics. Plus, it's very unlikely that you're going to take any astro classes in the specialisation that you end up in, so even the astro-specific things you *do* memorise early on have little use. You're going to change subfields, none of it will be worth anything anymore, and you'll have to self-teach your new field anyway.

It's much better to have a full physics background and then self-teach your subfield of astrophysics at the start of your PhD. It's either that, or self-teach *both* the physics (hard to do without classes) and astrophysics.",1597119238,astrophysics,astro-temp,Astrophysics,Comment,266

THEN go to your local amateur astronomy club and become a member. Go to their monthly star parties and see the different types of scopes and talk to the friendly people there - bring snacks or drinks to bribe people to talk to you! The you can test run some scopes and ask lots of questions.

You can do this while you're saving your money.

Go to /r/telescopes to learn about different mounts and types of scopes and their pros and cons so you can talk to the star party people and know what they're talking about.

Yes.

An outer -- or inner -- orbit might become habitable, yes, however, without the details (of the Sun's evolution) it's hard to say if such an orbit contains a planet/-oid, or whether we would have to arrange for one.   


&gt;Could the water on Uranus and Neptune be heated to life sustaining temperatures for a couple billion years before the sun eventually consumes them too?

Again, without going into the details (ie. I'm not doing the math on this), my guess is no, our Sun couldn't do that.  But in principle, similar scenarios might occur.

4836,"&gt; I know for sure I want to go to grad school and study Astrophysics, but my limited knowledge and experience thus far is holding me back from choosing which topic to focus on, and I'm not entirely sure where to look to research my options.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure I agree with your gatekeeping sentiments on the topic though, even if they have some wisdom behind them. No one should decide who and shouldn't further study the topic based on their own personal criteria, so long as they actually do the work and complete their schooling.

The reason why I was a bit harsh to you is that the selection for graduate school is hard and next to general physics knowledge self-motivation is extremely important if you want to succeed as a researcher. The selection here is hard, even at the good state school level, the typical oversubscription is 1:5 to 1:10. At the same time, graduate school is fully funded, i.e., depending on the university selecting a new graduate student means a financial commitment that is comparable to buying a house. 

Now put yourself in the shoes of somebody who is selecting new graduate students. Would you choose to hire somebody because they say ""[astrophysics] is the topic that excites me the most"", but is unable to be more specific about *what exactly* excites them (I've asked you twice and you have *not* answered that question), or would you hire somebody who is able to give concrete examples about what motivated them to choose astrophysics, has some research experience through REU projects, and can demonstrate a good overview of astrophysics? These are the people you are competing with in the selection process. Typically, they will have more knowledge about astrophysics than many of the other applicants and are also able to show that they have an interest in the field that goes above and beyond of what average candidates have. 

So, what do I mean by this? For example, you are saying that you don't know a lot about astrophysics because you have not been able to take an astrophysics course yet because of the way your physics education is structured. But this is an excuse where you are shifting the blame for not doing your home work of learning about the field to your university - what committees will look for is for people who to overcome such limitations. Seen from the point of view of a selection committee member what you are saying is that while you're interested a bit in it, you did not try to learn things on your own, e.g., by reading astrophysics textbooks. Your university has a library - use it! This is something that a student who has a really deep interest in the field would have done. And this is something that a selection committee will also look for: Research - and this is what graduate school is all about - is finding out new things that are not taught, and this requires willingness to learn on your own and to build new knowledge, and one of the good indicators for research aptitude is when students go and use the resources that are available to find things out, rather than just wait for it to be taught in a lecture.

You can argue that this is unfair, but given the large number of people who are applying for graduate school, this is a ""buyer's market"" and the competition is hard. The above are not *my* criteria, but this is how any decent selection committee will behave when faced with 50-100 applications for 5-10 places, especially if the 10% best applicants have done the things that I describe above.",1596963175,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,619

It’s not possible with planets and life as we know it. However, if we had much smaller mass planets. And let’s say that life was smaller as well.  And the planetary body was somehow protected by a large electromagnetic field, maybe enough so to support its own atmosphere.... maybe it would be possible (But I still doubt it).

Perhaps, imagine two small moons, circling each other, in the orbit of a gas giant with a strong EM field to protect them, distant enough from each other and the gas giant as to experience tidal forces without being ripped apart or colliding (in the short term). Perhaps it could be aquatic life; an atmosphere of liquid, held together by surface tension, with two minor planetary bodies within. One issue then could be keeping the water liquid... but our gas giant could potentially be closer to the parent star.

 ...it’s not an easy writing task you’ve taken on. It’s definitely a challenge to make this plausible.

Unfortunately due to the structuring of pre-requisites and courses at my university, I haven't been able to take an Astrophysics course until this coming semester, although I've taken several Astronomy courses.

The reason I wish to study Astronomy is because our universe excites me beyond compare, and I want to learn as much as I can and use my knowledge to somehow help advance our understanding of the universe, however small my contribution may be. I completely realize this is quite naive as motivation, but its gotten me this far and I don't plan on stopping.

I'm sorry for replying so late. I've been doing some research on the topic, and I think I've found an ancient Google Groups [post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.astro.research/6sIzX-UE_iE) that has shed some light on the question. At least, I believe so.

I'm sorry I couldn't understand your explanations. My knowledge of physics in general isn't as great and I learn relatively slowly. 

In the post, I came across something quite interesting. One of the participants stated:

&gt;Since the bodies are not perfectly rigid, the tidal forces will raise  
bulges in the surface. The twin bulges of our oceans are an example  
of this.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mass in the nearest bulge, being slightly closer to the orbiting  
body than the rest of the planet is, tends to attract it a little  
more strongly. Model the tidal bulge as a point mass rolling around  
the surface of the planet, exerting a tiny force on the satellite's  
orbit.  
&gt;  
&gt;But, since the bulges have some ""viscosity,"" they take some time to  
rise and fall-- the distortion in the planetary crust, or in the ocean  
surface, takes time to respond to the increases or decreases in tidal  
force. This effectively makes the motion of the bulge around the  
planet \*lag behind\* the orbital motion of the satellite. So the  
nearest bulge is always pulling on the satellite from a little behind  
in its orbit, not from directly below. A better way to say this is  
that the tidal force between the bulge and the satellite does \*not\*  
act in the radial direction, but rather in a slightly different  
direction, so that the tidal force has a small component that acts  
along the tangential direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps that was what I was missing when I misunderstood how ""rotation lags behind orbital motion."" Is that what it means?

4855,"Part of the problem is there's a lot of crossover, and things don't remain static.

At one time, people really focused on wavelengths used (radio astronomy vs optical vs infrared vs x-ray, for example) and specialized that way. Now, multi-wavelength seems to be more common and subject matter is more in vogue.

Some of the major areas include:

- Exoplanet and planetary (huge right now) -- lots of focus on multi-wavelength.detecrion of planetary atmospheres and characteristics, for example
- Gravitational wave (also huge) - general relativity, but also looking into some pretty deep stuff on neutron star characteristics and equations of state, stellar remnant ""mass gap"" investigation, galactic evolution (more will happen on this when longer-wavelength gravitational wave instrumentation comes online), etc.
- High energy (e.g. active galactic nuclei, tie ins with star  formation and galactic/universe evolution)
- Galactic (dynamics, galaxy evolution and morphology, chemistry and inter-stellar media)
-Extragalactic (inter-galactic media, galaxy groups and cluster formation and evolution)
- Cosmology (tends to be highly theoretical work, focusing on dark matter, dark energy, high-redshift universe origins, big-picture stuff)
-Solar and stellar (star evolution, space weather, magneto hydrodynamics of stars)
- Computational (all areas make extensive use of computing and modeling these days, but this really focused on that aspect, including big-data aspects, Bayesian and machine learning techniques, etc.)
- instrumentation (possible tie ins with engineering; someone has to design the instruments everyone uses, and this is absolutely bleeding edge, state-of-the-art work to make the most sensitive, capable stuff ever created)

For us that isn't the case: the presence of matter (dark or otherwise) has been slowing down the expansion through gravity, while for the last couple of billion years the growing importance of dark energy has led to the expansion beginning to accelerate instead.

By chance, we seem to exist at the point in time where all this evolution cancels out, and the Universe has expanded by the same amount that it would've had the expansion remained constant all along.",1596671343,astrophysics,nivlark,Astrophysics,Comment,146

If you draw one on a basket ball though, you’ll see the angle add up greater than 180, because it’s a curved surface.

4894,"Not on the scale where the universe is homogenous. Gravitational time dilation is something that occurs when you have some central mass. Closer to the mass, time runs slower. On the largest scales the universe appears homogenous, so there is no central mass and hence no such time dilation/redshift. Instead you get redshift because space expands as the light travels from one place to the other.

There is, however, a similar effect to what you are asking; on smaller scales where inhomogeneities exist. It's called the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). When light enters a gravitational well (caused by an overdense region) it gains energy, but as it exits, it loses this energy again. However, expansion causes the gravitational well to shallow over time, meaning light coming out loses less energy. The light traveling through the gravitational well can thus exit with greater energy then it came in. This results in a blueshift of the light we receive. You can also have an underdensity in which case the light normally loses energy when it enters, and gains it back when coming out. With the ISW this light would get redshifted.",1596645908,astrophysics,missle636,Astrophysics,Comment,189

This second planet is closer to Jupiter only for 1/3 of the time: When it is within 60 degrees of Jupiter as seen by the Sun.

If you increase the orbital radius (to match that of Saturn) then the 60 degree point is even farther away: You get an even smaller fraction of the orbit where Saturn is closer than Mercury.

But, even if you'd like to pretend there is, the expansion of the universe isn't really the same as having velocity. Our distance from distant galaxies does change with the expansion of the universe, but we aren't moving away from them; the space between us is just expanding.

There's this really common balloon metaphor cosmologists use to describe this. Imagine that you draw two dots on a balloon. As you blow up the balloon, the dots get farther apart. But, neither dot is actually moving across the surface of the balloon, the balloon is just expanding. Space is like the balloon, and galaxies are the dots. Space gets bigger, making the galaxies farther apart.

Then, in terms of the 370 km s^-1 number, that's coming from observations, not theory. Here's a [really good article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/04/01/how-fast-does-earth-move-through-the-universe/#3ea5f2b54d5c) that explains it in detail. But, tldr, it's sort of like looking out the window of a car as you drive down the road. You can see thing in front of you getting closer, and things behind you getting farther away. So if you assume those things are still, you can calculate your velocity relative to them. When we do that with the planet, we get 370 km s^-1. 

That number varies with the motion of the earth around the sun, and the motion of the sun around the galaxy.

4981,"I can see what you mean, but reality is a little bit stranger than how you describe it.

First off, the [universe has no center](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/centre.html). So it's not accurate to say that we're moving away from a central point. Yes, distant galaxies get farther away from us because of the expansion of the universe, but it's just as accurate to say that we get farther away from them. There's not a central point we expand away from. And, at large enough scales, we don't notice any structures that would indicate a center to the universe. The universe looks basically the same no matter where in it you are. That's called the [cosmological principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle).

Second, all velocity is relative by the theory of relativity. There isn't a ""true 0 velocity"", since you can pick any [inertial reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference) you want and all the laws of physics stay the same. If I stop moving _relative to the center of the galaxy_, it's true that I would be moving quite quickly _relative to the earth_. But choosing the center of the galaxy to represent 0 velocity is just an arbitrary choice. It would be equally valid (as far as physics is concerned) to choose your current velocity as 0, and claim that the center of the galaxy is moving quite quickly relative to you. 

That all being said, it might make a lot of sense to use the [CMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) as our ""velocity 0"" reference frame. That's called [peculiar velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peculiar_velocity#Cosmology). In that sense, we move at about [370 km s^-1](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/33514/how-fast-are-we-moving-relative-to-the-cmb). But again, that's just us choosing a reference frame to use.

That was an early prediction shortly after the discovery, when the orbit was poorly known. A few days later it was clear it won't hit Earth in 2029 and since 2013 we also know it won't hit Earth in 2036. Now the largest risk is 1 in 150,000 in 2068. There is a high chance it will hit Earth eventually - at some point in the next 10 million years or so.

Apophis' position has been measured over *4000 times* by many different groups in many countries. What if one of these groups decides to lie about the orbit? Their points are outside the orbit given from the other groups - they will be labeled as outliers and people will tell that group to check their setup. Same for the size.

5004,"&gt;is it possible for NASA/other programs to lie about an asteroid’s size/orbit?

Anyone can lie about anything, that doesn't mean other people couldn't easily prove them wrong.

&gt;is it possible that those facts aren’t right? 

It's almost certain those facts no longer accurate because orbital dynamics are very complex. The likelihood of an impact will be refined as it comes back around but it's likely that the orbit will vary slightly from current calculations when it does.

&gt; heard someone say, “if doomsday was going to occur, they wouldn’t tell us.”

Plays great in movies, but not so much the real world. You have far too many people watching the skies that don't subscribe to some sort of unproven secret international organization. If they wanted to prevent panic and mass economic devastation, then this organization dropped the ball on COVID-19. Additionally, the asteroid will be within the grasp of consumer grade telescopes (larger ones anyway) so you'll have lots of amateurs looking at it trying to caclulate its orbit, publishing their results.

&gt;could it be possible that it will cause extinction

It would cause damage but I don't believe it's large enough to cause global extinction. The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs was 6-9 miles in diameter. The asteroid in question is hundreds of feet in question. So I'd think you'd see a notable regional impact and some subtle global indications.

Um.  The previous commenter said nothing of the sort, and it's rather very wrong to think so.  Yes, it's a tricky thing to use, but astrophysicists and cosmologists do it all the time, with decent success.   


&gt;For example a large cluster of star in space isn’t actually 1000’s rather, 100’s.  The light is just being reflected/refracted due to gravitational lensing multiple times across the vastness of space before it reaches us.

That's not gravitational lensing -- nor astrophysics.  It's a flight of fancy.

5021,"I’m a physicist specialized in cosmology and now working on galaxy evolution.

Actually, space time distortions and redshift help with identifying the uniqueness of an object.

When you mention “unique objects instead of [...] reflections” I assume you’re thinking of strong lensing: e.g. different light rays from a single galaxy may reach different corners of a galaxy cluster located between the galaxy and the observer. The cluster will make the galaxy light rays re-converge (i.e. multiple distorted images of that one galaxy will surround the cluster for the specific observer).
The obvious way to verify if you’re looking at the same reflected galaxy is to check the signatures of their spectra coming from both continuous emission or emission/absorption lines — spectra provide information both on how active a galaxy is (how many stars it contains or it is forming) and on its chemical makeup. Spectra, however, are not always available: the faintest objects require a long exposure to collect a strong signal. Collecting spectra may be too expensive or unfeasible. Fortunately technologies such as IFUs (integral field units) have come to our aid in recent years.
Stars are even easier to classify. They’re not normally subject to abnormal space time distortions unless they orbit a black hole, and their main populations are well studied (stellar astronomers will revile me for saying so, because there are actually a large number of peculiar stars — but at least theirs isn’t a study muddled by large statistics of mixed objects)

What IS notoriously difficult is observing light from the intergalactic medium of nearby galaxies and clusters. There is no way to isolate stray light coming from the interstellar medium (ISM) of our own Milky Way, so our ISM currently represents a hard limit on the observation of rarefied media.

Tl;dr: light from far away objects (but not too far away) is easier to classify uniquely — because it is observed through a narrower aperture and it will possess characteristic marks of that given class of objects. 
In my experience, the hardest“object” to isolate from foreground/background vs actual source is the rogue light from the gas and dust media.",1596091555,astrophysics,Oycla,Astrophysics,Comment,355

When the earth orbits the sun, we can measure the tinniest differences in the starts relative positions from when we observe them in a different time lf the year. Using trigonometry, we can find the distance to a particular object (if you're confused, looking up stellar parallax under google images or on youtube may help).

If you want to go back to college to do physics, I recommend that you read the more popular astronomy books for motivation (the planetary society course is nice, there are also many introduction to astronomy textbooks for 1st year non-science major courses, which are informative, even though shallow on the physics. But that's fine. Buy them used, the updates are minimal and it really doesn't matter if you get a book that's 5 years old. The field has changed, but not so dramatically that it will matter. And these books are much cheaper than the extortion prices that are charged for the new editions. Examples are Hartmann's Astronomy a Cosmic Journey, Bennett et al., Astronomy: The cosmic perspective, or Kauffman &amp; Freedman, Universe. They're all at a similar level and good bedside reading ;). 

To prepare for college, brush up your trigonometry and definitively do calculus. It will be hard for a few weeks and will feel pointless. Trust me, it isn't. The important thing is that you should try to understand calculus rather than just memorize it. Even though you might be tempted to do the latter, understanding what integrals and differentiation mean is very crucial to understanding physics, and it will give you a much deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations that make up physics as a science. 

The important thing with this is that listening to some online lectures will NOT help you in this understanding. Lectures are good at explaining some basics, but they will not give you everything that you need for understanding. The only way to that is to practice, practice, and practice.

The information you're looking for is nicely laid out in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/fyjmpv/updated\_so\_you\_want\_to\_be\_an\_astronomer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/fyjmpv/updated_so_you_want_to_be_an_astronomer/)

&amp;#x200B;

But I'll give you my TLDR: it doesn't really matter, as long as the fundamental courses (mechanics, E&amp;M, quantum) are covered well. you'll pick up the coursework specialization in grad school, and it's not required to specialize before that.

&amp;#x200B;

My program (physics degree, specializing in astrophysics) was about 80% the normal physics courses, and subbed out astro courses for advanced lab courses or an additional math course. But it doesn't matter, since you'll pick up all the specialization you'll need in grad school. And most grad schools that aren't pure astronomy programs require advanced E&amp;M, statistical mechanics, and similar courses, so if you miss out on those in undergrad, you may be at a disadvantage. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's WAY more important are the research opportunities at the college you go to. That'll give you a chance to experience what life as an astrophysicist is like, and it'll make you a much stronger candidate to graduate programs. If you can find a school that encourages undergraduate research and has at least 4/5 professors working in astro, you'll not only have a leg up in grad school but you'll be able to figure out what kinds of research you enjoy or hate.

5062,"Let me preface this by saying that I DID NOT DO AN ASTROPHYSICS COURSE, I studied general PHYSICS instead, so my opinion is from my own experience.

I believe that studying general physics is not only a safe bet, since you will leave yourself more options in case you change your mind (and one's mind can change!), but it is also greatly beneficial in training you up as a proficient physicist (and perhaps even astrophysicist).

As you undertake your studies, you will see that similar and analogous principles pop up in many areas of physics, and many times it is the case of a principle from one area of physics finding an application in an entirely different area of physics. Studying physics in the general sense may leave you in awe of how intertwined all of the physical processes in our universe really are, and it will show you everything else our world has to offer! 

To give a few examples: quantum mechanics finds a place in both stellar processes and materials science (and more), special and general relativity can be leveraged in the study of galactic evolution but also in how particles behave in an accelerator,  fluid dynamics enable us to study the aerodynamics of man-made vehicles but also the behaviour of the primordial soup which existed prior to the big bang!

I'm sure you won't miss out of you study astrophysics right from the get-go, exactly because of how interdisciplinary it is. However, you also most definitely won't miss out if you study general physics. I can vouch for that since I studied general physics but my master's thesis focused on searching for resonant pairs of exoplanets (an effect which is of interest because it seems to substantially affect the lifetime of these systems - in our own solar system we have Pluto and Neptune locked into a protective 3:2 orbital resonance), which was a purely astrophysical project I was lucky to work on for two years.

So either way you choose, you'll have a lot of fun during your studies (along with a few tears here and there). If it were up to me, I'd go for general physics since I experienced many shifts in my research interests throughout my studies, and I'm still at a loss as to which area I want to pursue. My options are open though. Don't fear changing your research interests, your life will be full of twists and turns and you will inevitably do something which you have a passion for! Don't be afraid to try different things :) 

Good luck deciding!

Edit 1: your undergrad studies likely won't have the largest effect on your career (in terms of specialization). You will begin to specialise once you choose a bachelor's/master's thesis, but you will still be able to shift your focus afterwards if you so wish. A PhD might begin to lock you into a field a bit more since you will become an expert in a specific topic, but even then you could change to a different area of physics afterwards as long as your expertise can be applied there. Just keep this in mind, your first years will not decide your fate.

Edit 2: you may also be able to change your course some time down the line if you feel your current one isn't working out. This one depends on the educational system you are in, but I studied in Scotland and I changed from doing my 1st year in mechanical engineering to continuing in physics from the 2nd year onwards.",1595955709,astrophysics,seniorflippyflop,Astrophysics,Comment,593

5103,"You may want to look into string theory, it deals with extra dimensions wrapped within themselves into a region several orders of magnitudes smaller than fundamental particles.

General relativity deals with the deformation of the 3 spatial dimensions and the 1 time dimension, which is how gravity manifests.

I suggest watching PBS SpaceTime first, then reading some popular science books. Suggestions that come to mind are The Hidden Reality by Brian Greene, Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll, and Reality is Not What it Seems by Carlo Rovelli. 

Then, most importantly, study lots and lots of math. Get ahead of everyone else you know. Study for example from IB/AP textbooks and solve every problem. At the very least, every other problem with a solution in the back. They will start from scratch so if you put in the right amount of effort you can be self-taught with them.

Then tackle college calculus, including multi variable, differential, and complex calculus etc. ASAP. You will find coursera and EdX classes guiding you through this. You’ll need to do the same thing also or simultaneously, for physics. By this point you will have the maturity to tackle tensor calculus and topology/abstract algebra, and this is where the magic of dimensions begins :)

Best of luck! I believe in you, I also studied college physics and college math at 13, I am a physicist now. Start working on it now, because by the time you reach college, you’ll have enough stuff to juggle to really take your time and absorb the material at your own pace. College will be stressful. If you ever encounter problems that the adults/teachers around you can’t help you with, forums and the internet are your best friend.

5155,"Matter is ""destroyed"" in every black hole. As I tried to explain further in the second and third answer (along with the first) the difference between super massive black holes and smaller ones is not a question of if, but where. Smaller black holes it will occur before you reach the event horizon and in larger ones you'll *possibly* be able to pass the event horizon intact. 

The Gforce in a solar mass (tiny) black hole is estimated about 135 trillion around the EH and we can typically survive up to 9Gs. Try to fathom the difference in those numbers. If you took 1 inch on a ruler and multiplied it by 15 trillion (135/9) you'd have approximately half the length of our solar system's radius. 200+ million miles and Uranus is less than 500 million from the sun. 2 inches compared against the Sun to Uranus. See... my head hurts already!

I've read some calculations that presume some of the most massive black hole event horizons only have about 9Gs at the EH. But I'm not an expert and rely on research (math really is pain for me). Even so, in super massive black holes, beyond the horizon, the Gforce and speed you travel at increases as you approach the singularity. If its powerful enough that no matter or light can escape then you keep getting sucked in until gravity and pressure turn you into sub atomic particles. So you die still very far from the theoretical singularity but possibly around or beyond the event horizon. Stars can do it too if you or anything else could somehow survive the thermo-nuclear chain reactions. In fact, neutron stars are probably a better example than our Sun (which i used above) since they are considered *failed* black holes (collapsed stars not massive enough to form a black hole).

&gt; On average, gravity on a neutron star is 2 billion times stronger than gravity on Earth.

Think anything could survive that even if it could survive the radiation? So no. Nothing survives falling to a star let alone a black hole beyond the event horizon. *No matter it's size.* Small ones will simply kill you before you get even close.


This lists a couple examples (calculations) [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification) along with more information.

I understand science fiction plays a big part in these misconceptions (worm holes and alternate universes) but the easiest way to think about it is to compare in this order: (1)standard star, (2)neutron star, (3)black hole. Pretend they're all ""cold"". They still kill you with immense gravity and pressure.

5157,"ok, then, as I said, take a look at where open clusters come from - they're young systems of stars that were formed together and will disperse over time due to the differential rotation of the disk.

Globular clusters are a completely different thing, they're the oldest systems of stars in the Galaxy and were born before the disk formed, so they have a distribution that's appropriate to the almost spherical distribution of stars in the early history of the Galaxy

 So, the only common thing between globular clusters and open clusters is that both are called ""clusters"", since they are higher density concentrations of stars. However, these names come from the 18th and 19th centuries, when people didn't know about their origin. Which is fine - most terms in astronomy have such historical baggage, but but don't let the names confuse you (another prominent example is naming spectral classes  of stars ""early type"" and ""late type"", which has to do with ideas from the 1920s and 1930s but we know today that these terms have nothing to do with stellar age).",1595571445,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,182

5160,"1. No. Matter inside a black hole beyond the event horizon is deconstructed down to sub atomic particles (possibly before it even hits the EH depending on size). Colliding black holes just make bigger ones. 


2. The spaghetti effect is mainly analogy because you are small, but gravity-monster is big. Stupid big. If you were a planet the size of Jupiter you might notice a difference on each side? I'm guessing on that. But you fall into a black hole around 50-60,000 MILES a SECOND. Your orientation doesn't matter when you're being torn apart before you have a chance to feel it. I posit you don't get close enough to see a damn thing before you're dead, but I've never tried it. 
Think about what it's like touching the surface of the sun and imagine what you'd see when you do. Then remember you die long before you get close enough to touch anything. In this analogy the event horizon is the surface of the sun. Supposedly super massive black holes might allow you to break the event horizon before you die. We'll have to fly a black box thousands of light years away one day to find out if it survives that process I suppose. Won't matter though since any camera or measuring device would have no way of returning an image once it crosses per the laws of physics. We could one day hypothetically see if the object itself survives long enough to cross a literally invisible boundry I guess? Like, to see if it just vanishes before being torn apart.


3. No one has anything but guesses about what's beyond a black hole event horizon. We know matter and energy goes in after being disintegrated down to sub atomic particles and doesn't come out (Hawking radiation is still speculative). That's it. We can barely observe them as it is and thats only happened in the last year or so. We have a picture. What can you make of it? See Airplane! the movie for sarcastic but applicable answers. Before then it was just math and indirect observation. Good math, but still just math. So wormholes, other universes, energy consuming unicorns, whatever. Imagine whatever you want.

5167,"Start looking into universities in your immediate area right away.  Even while in high school, you can approach professors and offer to work on current research with them.  Don't be discouraged if the projects seem dull (almost all of them are), your experience there will put you miles ahead.

Math, especially algebra and later calculus, will be extremely important so try to get a handle on it.  The better you are at math, the more you can focus on the concepts it represents.

Coding is also very important.  Python is the main language used by all astrophysicists.  Learn it!  One of the biggest skill in demand among researchers is coding (along with other computer science and electrical skills).

Figure out what universities are actually good for your major.  As for me, UCF was very bad.  Everything there essentially requires you to self-teach your way to a degree, not recommended.  

Finally, learn exactly what you're getting into.  Any field in academia means the majority of your time will be spent reading and writing very heavy research papers.  I mean constantly, because there will always be too much research being published to keep up with and you will always be putting your papers out to compete for funding.  As an astrophysicist, you pretty much require a PhD.  Don't get distracted by other interesting classes.  Stick with the program or you'll never finish at all.  

Also, from what I have experienced there are two main jokes when it comes to physics students:

1.  Don't be one.  Your mental health and self esteem will suffer.  Not phrased as a joke here, but you get the idea.  Physics students often use dark humor regarding their own depression to mask the fact that they are indeed very depressed.

2.  Biology isn't a real science (lol)

On the bright side, your initial focus on math and sciences will give you an excellent head start in engineering if you need a back up plan!

Reasons I'm leaving:
.#1 I hate writing. #2 since the UK is leaving the EU, funding is probably going to get more difficult in the near future, though I admit that's not totally clear yet. #3 applying for funding, from what I understand is a fucking major pain in the ass at the best of times. #4 I have no major interest in any particular field really. Maybe cosmology, but my PhD isn't IN cosmology. #5 I think studying towards a goal, like working in academia, for the last 13 years like I have, is long enough to decide you've had enough and don't want it anymore.


I can tell you this, while I was doing my PhD only 1-2 out of 12(ish) people who finished while I was studying chose to stay in academia. PhDs can really beat the passion you have for something out of you. But maybe none of us really loved it in the first place... I certainly thought I did.

5205,"Hi,

*My story (If interested):*

I got accepted into Astrophysics bachelor's degree program, without any prior interest or experience in physics/math, back in 2016. I dropped out first semester due to really intense use of Calculus and Differential Equations right from the beginning (In classes such as Mechanics, Thermodynamics...), while I was still struggling with basic trigonometry and basic physics knowledge. In the following 2 years I was learning math on the side while having part-time jobs. in 2018. I came back to my program, and it went with ease. (Got almost all A's, and in this year I am mostly A's and B's)

*My view and advice:*

It is doable, but you need a strong mentality.  Be sure to learn what Astrophysics actually is, it is 90% maths and coding and logic, and 10% of having to actually memorize anything about space. **Be sure to understand all the math you learn**, really, understand the logic behind the thing you are learning and why is it invented in maths, and learn some history on it to see how humans needed that math at particular task. Only with understanding of math and it's application to physics will you truly be able to appreciate cool things about space. Math is such a skill, that surely it is beyond anything human mind has accomplished. **Use office hours as much as you can,** be open to your professors about your situation and don't be afraid to ask anything you think they'll find dumb. The more you talk maths with those people the more you see the thought process of someone who uses math frequently. **Use the time you have now, to prepare for first semester** \- I really wish I looked into my first semester before I blindly just went there. Just look into syllabus, and find the books on the subjects you have in the first semester, and try to get it done now - because, you will be slower than students with any physics/math background. **Beginning is the hardest, trust me,** the more you learn math and physics, your logic gets much better and you will find the tools to understand next subject much faster that you could now. And the last one I could think of is **be sure to understand the basics really good,** such as trigonometry, calculus, functions in general, be sure to know the true meaning and if you have time now spend it mostly on these things. (You can look into 3Blue1Brown channel on YouTube, for these topics, to see what I sort of mean by understanding). Studying anything more complex after those subjects will come with ease if you understand the logic behind the basics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Sorry that advices are not really concise, but I had to answer your question since I had it the same 4 years ago and ended up maybe wasting 2 years of my life, as I was not organized on what I was missing to understand the classes.*",1595519947,astrophysics,SignificantFile4,Astrophysics,Comment,497

What they give is the flux, how many antiproton pass through a given surface per time. Converting that to a density would need more information, but we can make a rough estimate based on table 1. Row by row:

* Take the mean kinetic energy, convert it to a velocity. For an order of magnitude you can even ignore relativity here and use Newtonian mechanics.
* Divide the flux by this velocity. You now have particles per cubic meter, steradian, and GeV (energy range)
* Multiply by the energy range of this row, e.g. (0.46 GeV-0.35 GeV) = 0.11 GeV for the first row. You now have particles per cubic meter and steradian.
* They don't give an angular distribution, but for an order of magnitude estimate we can just assume it's the same in all directions, then multiply the number by 4 pi. You now have particles per cubic meter in this row. Multiply by the proton mass if you want mass per cubic meter.
* Add all the rows.

The result should be somewhere in the range of one antiproton every million cubic meter or so. If you want to collect that antimatter and use its energy: You'll need something like the total number of antiprotons in Earth's atmosphere (at any given point in time) just to make a cup of coffee.",1595481289,astrophysics,mfb-,Astrophysics,Comment,233

While I can’t answer your question, I’d love to share some resources I found really useful to explore astrophysics without any rigorous academic background.

I had so much fun learning truly mindblown theories and the professor did an amazing job explaining these concepts for the general audience.

I took a 1-week masterclass (which they no longer offer but I believe they are transforming these into full-fledged courses) on inflationary cosmology, explained by the theory founder Alan Guth himself! 

Besides, I love watching YouTube videos from Minute Physics, PBS Space Time and FermiLab. You have probably heard about these channels before.

We can’t say anything about our universe before ~10^-32 seconds. GR cannot accurately describe a universe with these conditions. Sean Carroll discusses it briefly [here](https://youtu.be/FgpvCxDL7q4), and in more depth [here](https://youtu.be/2JsKwyRFiYY) and [here](https://youtu.be/rEr-t17m2Fo).

A singularity, as defined in general relativity does not have infinite mass. [A singularity is a location in spacetime where the gravitational field of a celestial body is predicted to become infinite in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system. The quantities used to measure gravitational field strength are the scalar invariant curvatures of spacetime, which includes a measure of the density of matter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity).

You cannot apply the Schwarzschild metric to the universe as a whole. 

The energy of the early universe was uniformly distributed, meaning there was no point to which everything would collapse.
 
[This site](https://www.desy.de/user/projects/Physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/universe.html) and [this article](https://www.space.com/13347-big-bang-origins-universe-birth.html) go into more detail.

5314,"Edit: Kindly skip this comment as it is factually inaccurate. 



Alright so I am not sure but the initial singularity that was the entire universe might not be part of a black hole. I think we just assume it is a singularity existing in nothing. So the only time that passes is for singularity it self. 

Now the simple answer would be all the mass of the universe. Simply the mass of all matter and dark matter. Since we define singularity in a black hole to have infinite density, mass and gravity. We can assume the entire mass of the universe was in this singularity.

Now I’m just speculating, but as soon as the singularity exploded in the Big Bang, a few picoseconds later, this is from what I vaguely remember seeing, the universe was a quark-gluon plasma mesh with Higgs Bosons. Higgs is supposed to give the attribute of mass to matter. Thus, the mass of the quarks was based on how much Higgs boson they were able to attract. Thus, 
I speculate with my very minimal knowledge of the Big Bang theory that the singularity might mostly be energy and Higgs bosons.

P.S: I have no clue the the Higgs bosons is formed. So I just assume before energy became mass the Boston existed. Thus existence is what allows the formation of matter. I might be going on a wild goose chase here, but I kind of find this theory of mine interesting.",1595303139,astrophysics,sid_vig,Astrophysics,Comment,245

I don’t mean just relativistic effects but its point that there is no *absolute time*. We know how old the universe is from our perspective but pieces we see may feel far older than we can imagine as we zoom by.

An analogy that works for me is comparing our reaction time to a fly. They perceive more time than we do so can react quicker from our perspective. Extrapolated to the black hole they experience very little time relative to the rest of the universe. So we are just seeing something in super slow motion. I’ve even wondered if there are things happening around us on a timescale faster than our perception making them invisible or frozen.

The first semester was hell - we had to do calculus and my foundation was very, very bad. It took a lot of time and determination, but eventually as you sit through the work, ask the questions on how to solve the problems or look at how *they* solve the problem you slowly start building your foundation. I poured hours into math and I barely passed my first semester in calculus and the second semester was a stuggle as well - but after 2 math modules and another 2 applied math modules with theoretical Comp Sci mixed in, my second year (which was like 70% math 30% Computer Science) went a lot smoother. A good foundation makes a MASSIVE difference.

These solutions however have the feature that if you have a dense enough mass, you actually have a horizon (this isn't the case for low density objects like earth, sun, for which the solution also applies).

The next step would be coming up with a process by which they would be created.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, including scientists and engineers from MIT, will receive a 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. The team is being honored for making the [**first direct detection**](https://scitechdaily.com/astronomers-reveal-first-direct-visual-evidence-of-a-supermassive-black-hole/) of a black hole. Assistant professor of physics Max Metlitski and several MIT alumni are also receiving awards from the Breakthrough Prize Foundation.

The $3 million fundamental physics prize will be shared equally with the 347 EHT researchers from around the world who co-authored the six papers published on April 10, 2019, which reported the detection of the supermassive black hole at the heart of Messier 87, or M87, a galaxy within the Virgo galaxy cluster.",1595032533,astrophysics,reddit455,Astrophysics,Comment,502

5409,"It's definitely just a hobby, but I want to have a solid, intensive understanding; it seems like most people just echo things they've heard/read without understanding it, which leads to misinformation and misconceptions. I fully understand that there's no way someone without a degree can get into professional research and make it a career.

You're spot on about the topics I need to learn more about, so I'll work at that for now. Thanks for your input!

Edit: Would you recommend going through earlier math courses as well? I'm good at using math for engineering, but many topics and the finer/heavily theoretical points simply get brushed over or rushed through in engineering math courses. I'd say my higher level math knowledge is built on to a shaky foundation as a result.",1595012902,astrophysics,Nick6373,Astrophysics,Comment,131

5411,"Lots of ways. Sometimes, you can directly test things in a lab, for example the properties of different atoms/ions present in a nebula. Other times, you have to use the equations to make a prediction that you can test with a telescope or other instrument. Technically you can never be sure that this prediction working out means that your theory is correct (it could just be coinicidence), but if you can make multiple predictions, and they all match with observations, then it becomes increasingly likely that it is. Computer simulations are also useful for this - they let you experiment with different theories/parameters to a theory etc., and figure out what provides the closest result to reality.",1595011756,astrophysics,nivlark,Astrophysics,Comment,117
5412,"The vast majority of ""astrophysics"" degrees are just physics degrees with a certain set of classes pre-selected for you. So I would suggest looking through a first-year physics syllabus and filling in the gaps in your knowledge. You probably don't need to go over mechanics/kinematics etc., but E&amp;M/quantum/special relativity might be less familiar.

As for your edit, it depends what you want to do. If this is just a hobby, then no, there's no real reason to need lab experience (other than for your own interest). It's more important if you're thinking about making a career of it, but in that case you're not going to be able to avoid going back to uni since a PhD is almost always required for research.",1595010476,astrophysics,nivlark,Astrophysics,Comment,123

5426,"What you're asking is metaphysical, whether what we can observe with our senses and our instruments is what is ""really"" true.

It not only has great explanatory and reproducibility power, but it can predict things that we don't even know about yet. Mathematics is an integral part of this, it is the language we use to describe physical phenomena. We do this because it *works*, because the laws of physics are observed to be structured, consistent, and universal. When we talk about the velocity of an object, we can say ""it changes distance as time goes by"" or we can parameterize the situation in terms of quantities such as the velocity *v*, distance *d*, and time *t* and compactly describe the motion mathematically with a formula such as *d*(*t*) = *vt*.

Bio-genesis. The oceans are huge and it still took a 9-10 figure time-scale for it to happen after conditions were suitable.

The transition from singe-cell to multicellular life. Most of the time earth has had life, it has been single cell organisms. The fact that it took 2+ billion years of single cell things living and doing their thing before they teamed up into a multicellular organism suggests that may be a significant filter.

Development of intelligence. Of all the species on earth, we might be the only ones with sufficient intelligence to develop technology. If there are other species with sufficient intelligence, there aren't many. millions of of other species don't, suggesting this is a pretty unlikely filter.

Development of technology. We've had the same brains for tens of thousands of years, maybe hundreds of thousands, it's only been in the last few thousand that we've been making technological progress. Intelligence does not guarantee technology. Consider the octopus... IDK how intelligent they are compared to us, I know they're pretty intelligent, but even if they are as intelligent as us, they live under water, so an octopus is never going to discover fire.

We'll see, on all of them.

Employers value the skills that are transferable across a wide range of disciplines.

Especially the way things are going, where more companies are needing people who can understand data and manipulate it to the desired result, any degree involving high levels of maths sets you on a good path.

There are quite a few factors tho. Things like what kind of course you study and how well-known is the uni you study at can matter. For example, here in the UK we have a national physics curriculum that unis must follow to be IOP (institute of physics) approved (basically makes your uni more attractive).

A way to think about that is to consider the 2-D surface of the Earth, If the Earth were flat, the surface would have edges. But the Earth is spherical, so the surface curves back around on itself. The Earth's surface has no edges and it has no center. A finite universe is like that.

5532,"There is no ""edge"" of the universe. However there is an edge of the observable universe, simply because of the fact that light coming from further away than said edge requires longer to get to us than the age of the universe.

However, like I said, there is no edge of THE universe. This is because the universe van have three ""shapes"":

-Flat

-Spherical

-Hyperbolic

Notice that these are all 4-dimensional (three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension)
Now what do these mean? I will explain them one by one:


**Flat:**

Contrary to popular belief this does not mean 2-dimensional. It means that parallel lines stay parallel, and any triangle you draw will be 180⁰ in total. In this case the universe will be infinite, like how an infinite plane has no edge.


**Hyperbolic:**

Sorta like the surface of a Pringle, but once again infinite, and of course 4D, and not 2D. Parallel lines will diverge (move away from each other) and triangles will be less than 180⁰. Once again, the universe will be infinite in this case.


**Spherical:**

Like the 4D-analog of the 2D sphere. Parallel lines will eventually cross, and triangles will be more than 180⁰.
In this case the universe would be finite, but still not have an edge. To see why I think it's useful to think about the most famous spherical surface: the earth. The earth is obviously finite in surface area, but it doesn't have an edge. The same would be the case in a spherical universe.



Note that I said pringles and spheres were 2D, while you might think these are 3D. I'm strictly speaking about the surface, which is 2D. Think how on earth you can describe your position with 2 coordinates, longitude and latitude; or how you can move in 2 distinct directions (north and east for example, where moving, say, south would be negatively moving north). Moving up wouldn't be a possibility, since you would ""leave"" the surface.

So which of these shapes is our universe? The answer is frankly, we don't know. Our measurements suggest it's very close to flat, but it might be slightly curved (so spherical or hyperbolic).",1594808018,astrophysics,looijmansje,Astrophysics,Comment,361

5538,"Every mass will work, but the object needs to be *really* slow relative to the person.

The mass distribution of John is complicated which makes the gravitational attraction complicated, but let's approximate him as 80 kg that are all in one place. He hold the tennis ball with stretched out arms (1 m) and gives it the tiniest push to the side to start its orbit.

The gravitational force is the product of gravitational constant, John's mass, the tennis ball mass, and the inverse distance squared: F = GMm/r^(2). To fly in a circle with radius r=1m, the tennis ball needs to experience a force of mv^(2)/r. Set both equal: mv^(2)/r = GMm/r^(2) and simplify: v=sqrt(GM/r) where sqrt() is the square root. Plugging in the gravitational constant, John's mass of 80 kg and the radius of 1 m we get v = 0.00007 m/s. That's about the diameter of a human hair per second. It's basically impossible to release an object with such a tiny velocity. But if you can, then the tennis ball orbits once per day. This is coincidence, [the calculation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+pi+meter%2Fsqrt%28gravitational+constant+*+80+kg%2F%281m%29%29) says 23 hours 53 minutes.

Note that the mass of the tennis ball didn't matter here, the result would be the same for a speck of dust (but non-gravitational forces would likely be larger there).

5548,"They orbit around a point in space, the balance point (I'm not native speaker, so Idk the terminology). You can see that for each body/planet/mass in space, that there isn't any body standing still while another one orbits them. Even the sun moves according to the balance point, but because there are many planets orbiting the sun it gets really complicated.

For the question with the tennis ball: If you say, that the man is not moving, and you materialize a tennis ball without giving it any force or acceleration, the two would simply fall together because of the acceleration of the gravitational forces of the two. If you want them to orbit they need some velocity that is not directed to the other body.

So to sum up: the size of the object is not important, both bodies would (almost) always orbit each other with the right amount of velocity etc.

And there is a max velocity you can calculate with: sqrt(2 \* g \* R) with g = gravitational force on the surface of an object and R = the radius of the object.

It's a little bit like watching waves in the ocean. If you measure the shape of the waves carefully you can conclude that e.g. a ship just passed you. That's not very interesting if you can see the ship directly, but what if it was an invisible ship, or it's night (the ship doesn't have lights) and you can only see the waves directly around you? That's what gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo do. They measure waves that arrive here and try to understand what emitted these waves.

5585,"&gt; I ask this because gravity affects time, ***RELATIVE to 2 different observers***

&amp;#x200B;

**Time dilation** is a difference in the elapsed **time** measured by **two clocks**, either due to them having a **velocity relative to each other**, or by there being a gravitational potential difference between their locations.

&amp;#x200B;

if you had both clocks, yes.

&amp;#x200B;

but it happens closer to home everyday due to gravitational influence.

&amp;#x200B;

the clocks on the ground fall out of sync with the clocks on GPS satellites in orbit - all the time they're constantly corrected.

&amp;#x200B;

ground clocks have a tiny bit more gravity acting on them because they're.. on the ground.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error\_analysis\_for\_the\_Global\_Positioning\_System#Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Relativity)

This [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) effect has been measured and verified using the GPS.

The effect of gravitational frequency shift on the GPS due to [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) is that a clock closer to a massive object will be slower than a clock farther away. Applied to the GPS, the receivers are much closer to Earth than the satellites, causing the GPS clocks to be faster by a factor of 5×10−10, or about 45.9 μs/day.

If there's accretion then there's material streaming beyond the ISCO, so it doesn't have to be the hottest or fastest moving region, especially when turbulence and instabilities are taken into account.

Unfortunately, finding the ""right"" equations for an accretion disk is literally impossible. You can't make a general case. If you're looking at the ISCO then you also need to include nonlinear MHD effects, plus GR, plus radiation. That simulation is millions of CPU hours.

So can nucleosynthesis occur in an accretion disk?

Of course observations astronomy can be good at any age level: Telescopes, infrared, radio, and other various spectrums. After all, they make telescopes with recommended ages starting at 10, but they also make telescopes that you can't get near without a PhD. :)

Particle and Quantum/theoretical physics is usually too abstract for me and I would have been told ""no"" if I was back in highschool, but I admit I have no idea what they teach/expect in 11th grade (in any country) today.

Of course even seemingly simple topics like Stars or Planets can be dissected and refined down to chemical compositions - chain reactions, matter density, nucleosynthesis, accretion formation, angular momentum, etc. So you can literally pick an object in our solar system and write a book on it.

Even a seemingly simple topic like ""Our Sun"" can blow someone's mind if you dig deep.

I've switched most of my scientific computation to Julia because it's more performant code and it's easier to write vectorized code. Many times a naively implemented for loop in Julia is good enough and you won't have to chase further optimizations (lookup ""loop fusion""). I started off in Julia writing loops because old habits, but more often now I can see how to implement a loop as a broadcasted function in a line or two.

Sometimes this is obvious (for example when exactly the same operation is done on every element of the array) but for other operations tricks like masking or skipping some of the values might be needed.

I'll assume you want to get a technical job in the space industry. By far the most common types of jobs in this industry are engineering jobs. So if you want to go from Physics to the space industry, the major thing you are lacking is engineering knowledge. The problem with physics in the context of the space industry is that it's very in-depth and conceptual, whereas for engineering jobs you need concepts that perhaps you didn't study in depth. Coming from physics, it shouldn't be too hard to fill the gaps, you can take some online courses for example in mechanics of materials.

What you also need is knowledge on spacecraft and space in general. What I did to fill in this gap is play Kerbal Space Program (yes, it is a videogame but MANY of the concepts in that game apply to real-life spacecraft so it is a GREAT way to get an introduction to, for example, orbital dynamics) and attend the Master's in Space Science at the International Space University in France. This is a very generic course but I did get a chance to do a three-month internship at NASA Goddard, which was great. I don't know if you are able/want to attend this specific course, but you do need knowledge about spacecraft and orbits so try to find a way to obtain it.

If you want, you could also consider doing a PhD in Solid-State Physics applied directly to spacecraft, which would give you a knowledge set that could make you a valuable candidate to companies in this kind of field. You might also want to consider Additive Manufacturing, where there is A LOT of research into correlating the microstructure of the materials to their macroscopic properties. AM is also starting to be widely adopted in the space industry, I don't mean to toot my own horn but I wrote a [paper on the use of AM for space](https://idp.springer.com/authorize/casa?redirect_uri=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-019-03786-z&amp;casa_token=Yoa2VTz2jO8AAAAA:ViV1N1N5vvESm3sYfEgxpD02tPVqhyQx3vVh_9a1jxbFxG2AE2hNHY0YGeecOvwyEdQNukNhxR4PHrmoVw) and perhaps it might give you some ideas.

5775,"Dark energy doesn't move. All we know about dark energy is that it has to exist to cause the current observable expansion rate of the universe to match the predicted expansion rate of the universe using our current equations.

If you meant dark matter, however, this again would not be true. Dark matter is found using our equations of rotation of galaxies, observing their rotational velocity, and then discovering the expected rotational velocity is significantly less than the observed velocity. The most likely reason for this then, is due to some other undetectable mass in the galactic system. We call this dark matter.

All we know about dark matter is that it is only interacts with gravity, and can't be detected in any other known way. Its not just that we can't see it, we can't currently interact with it directly at all. Think of it like wind, we can't directly see it, but we can see the effects it produces (faster rotational velocity of galaxies).

Dark matter is not the same as normal matter in multiple ways, not just that we can't see it. And we know it is located near ordinary matter. It is true that objects moving away from us faster than the speed of light are invisible, as light cannot reach us from the object. However we also know it is impossible for matter to travel faster than the speed of light (unless due to the expansion of the universe).

I feel like the laws of physics that apply here on Earth or even elsewhere in the universe for particular objects aren't necessarily going to be the same for the universe as a whole. Also, the universe is probably not a bubble. It's often depicted more like a super weird cone or funnel that's expanding from its origin point, but I don't know if its shape can even truly be defined or hypothesized, since we can't observe it from the outside (if there is an ""outside"") and we don't know how things like dark matter or spacetime might affect the visual appearance of something as massive as the universe from the ""outside"".

We have to remember that, as far as we know, (and, frankly, even though we have learned/are learning a lot about the universe, we still really DON'T know a lot) the universe is infinite and there may or may not be something ""outside"" of it. Maybe there is, maybe ours is one universe in a multiverse, maybe there's literally nothing other than our universe (and whatever other realities/dimensions it might contain).

If the tear is large enough to be considered catastrophic and air depletes or vents at a fast enough rate, you lose consciousness before you eventually die. Asphyxiation, temperature loss and depressurization - take your pick. Since you lose consciousness first in any circumstance it doesn't really matter what kills you fastest. Temperature loss is normally the slowest method, however the escaping air can act as a thermal conductor and leech body heat much faster than had you just walked into space without a suit.

That's the proposed solution to a few problems in cosmology, the horizon problem, the flatness problem... And some others that I can't remember off the top of my head.

But aside from that, the idea you need to understand isn't that things are moving away from one another, the space those things are in is EXPANDING. This means that the further away from you something is, the faster it appears to be moving away from you (it's not moving away from you, space is expanding, but it LOOKS LIKE it is moving away from you)

So extend that idea out from nearby to us, to as far as you can imagine.

- Galaxies close to ours appear to be moving away from us pretty slowly, only a few hundred metres per second for example.


- Galaxies a bit further away appear to be moving a bit faster. A few thousand metres per second maybe.


- At what distance are galaxies moving away from us at 300,000,000 m/s (speed of light)? That is the boundary of our observable universe
... Things which are the age of the universe * the speed of light distance away from us are at the edge of OUR observable universe. Light emitted by something on the boundary would eventually reach us.


- What about a galaxy which is a little bit further away than that? It would appear to us to be moving away from us faster than the speed of light. I say it WOULD appear to be, because it's outside of our observable universe, any light which that galaxy sends our way can only move at the speed of light, but the space it has to travel through is expanding faster than the speed of light, so it will never get to us.



If you can grasp that, you should be able to see that our observable universe is just a sphere centred on us within the entire universe. Anything within that sphere is causally connected to us, we could contact it eventually using something travelling at the speed of light. Anything outside that sphere is no longer causally connected to us, no messages sent at the speed of light will never reach us because the space between us is expanding faster than light speed.

Someone 1000 light years to the left of us (wherever) has an observable universe centred on them. It would mostly overlap with ours, but it would have a different boundary.",1594162089,astrophysics,Mess104,Astrophysics,Comment,439

Through observations, we know for a fact that the universe is expanding because all objects are moving away (this is done by studying redshift in light) and we know a massive part of the universe accounts for this energy and we name it ""dark energy"" Yet no one knows what it is. Just know that we named the cause of expansion as dark energy. Since the expansion is speeding up, we also know for a fact that either the amount of dark energy or its strength is much much powerful that gravity and hence, it is accelerating.
However, it is believed that the universe with die a cold death. Rather than all particles being pulled apart by this expansion, first all stars will die to become either black holes or dwarfs. All white dwarfs will have a faint glow but will soon lose it to become black dwarfs. The universe now will barely have any signs of light. Black holes eat up anything that is left and eventually, multiple black holes will merge to form one. When there is nothing left for a black hole to consume, it will very very very slowly disintegrate via hawking radiation. Protons may break apart - We also still don't know if protons disintegrate at all or will they last forever. The universe now is dark and empty, with no signs of matter with space ever expanding.
I would like you to know that we know very very little to this date. Unless we know dark energy, we cannot predict any better.

By the time it reaches earth, the energy of the explosion will be spread out over a sphere with a radius equal to earth's orbit. The area of a sphere is given by (4/3)πR^2.

5903,"I like to believe that consciousness comes from one source kind of like the structure of a tree and we are the leaves. Obviously, this idea can't be proven or disproven, yet. It's just a fun idea I live by, but I don't take it extremely seriously. If you want to know my thoughts on the matter I can have a go. I'm going to warn you, this is going to be a long read probably.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the reason for consciousness?**

Based on my observations, the universe seems to operate like a mechanical machine with laws to follow. As far as we can tell, these laws never change. Since the laws don't change, the universe seems to be stuck in this weird situation where reality can't do more than what the mechanics allow it to do. It would make sense that the source of consciousness (which I think it would be cool that consciousness is reality itself) had to fragment itself to be able to do work it wouldn't be able to do by just letting itself operate as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The facts that 1. Our knowledge and cognitive prowess is vastly different than other animals. Different =/ superior, dolphins communicate through telepathic mediums, pigs are smarter than they lead on, and monkeys are shown to understand human operations but at a much lower level. The idea is that it's different, which makes our conscious different because it's perspective and the way we think.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure intelligence and consciousness go hand and hand. But, something tells me they are not the same thing. Although the more consciousness something has the greater it's awareness is with its environment, ideas, and itself. If we quantify whatever consciousness is to its basic parts, it will have low intelligence I guess. 

I think the different versions and configurations that you were talking about above is part of the process of consciousness. Say for whatever reason consciousness had to fragment itself (maybe to solve a problem. We'll get back to that). Reality can't just magically create a vessel out of thin air. It has rules to follow, remember? So, you start simple and in the case with earth, it was prokaryotic cells that naturally formed (For the records, no way am I saying that prokaryotic cells have consciousness). Many planets have these starting points to begin the process of developing complex conscious beings. Let us call these little creatures sperms I guess lol. Over time, the sperms start to adapt to their unique environments. Some survive the harsh conditions and some don't. The sperms that do survive in their unique position, go on to develop more complex configurations. In this case, on earth, they were sea dwellers. The process determines what can survive and spread the most offspring. In this stage, we can all agree that there is some kind of conscious behavior, but a low-resolution one nonetheless. I think this is where consciousness is extremely important because your survivability is not determined on the environment alone. A fish needs to have some consciousness to make desitions because other living things are making conscious desitions to survive. A sea creature is figuring out things such as: Is this too big to eat? Will it eat me? Should I hide under this thing to not be exposed? It's too hot or cold here and I need to move somewhere else (I don't have to state the obvious that these creatures can't think in language lol, but that doesn't mean they can't problem-solve for survival). This process continues over a long perioud of time. Inevitably, each mutation is a better configuration, which makes the being have better cognitive abilities. This goes on and on until we humans appeared. 

This is where things get more interesting. Humans are obviously unique on this planet. We are the top of the food chain here. Why? Because we are conscious as fuck. No longer do we have to use just horns, teeth, or claws to survive. We manipulate our environment and develop ideas to improve our survival. This is an interesting unique situation for us. We fight each other not just because we just want food, shelter, and sex but because we want to develop ideas that help us as a whole to survive. Human beings will kill each other over ideas and I think this is a necessary thing at the moment. The idea that wins and continues through the planet is the best idea for the time being in our situation. A perfect example is a fight between different forms of government such as capitalism and communism. 

You maybe think ""Okay, this is all obvious, but what does all this have to do with the idea that consciousness is really one thing?""

Want I think I really mean to say is consciousness WAS only one thing, but there is a problem with this. You can't change unless you have more that one reference point of view. Maybe this is the reason the universe doesn't change its laws. Consciousness arose to what it is today because it needs all these different objective interpretations to change and to become better at something. 

Better at what? I don't know. Maybe to continue being aware of reality. This is where I think this idea completely crumbles to a complete stop. I don't know what this is all leading to. All I know is we are trying to survive to better ourselves and our communities. This is evident with the progress we've made in the last 100 years. I like the idea from the writing The Egg by Andy Weir where we all are the same being and don't realize it till death and in that death, we learn from the experience to become a greater intellect. But, this all could be us trying to survive the ultimate death in the universe called the big rip. I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You're implying that if we teleported, with our conscious, we would be in a different reality relative to our former? Or are you saying that your conscious would be reborn or rather wiped and we'd lose our memories but retain the basic human functions, i.e., language, movement, and other innate and ""relevant"" functions? I personally think it's much more realistic to think that it's either going to teleport your already existing conscious or it'll leave you an empty vessel that's still alive (vegetable state). OR!!!! Are you saying that the you that comes out is STILL you but on an altered reality? Like you think different, your motives are different, and your sense of self changes?

&amp;#x200B;

No, I'm implying that consciousness is not independent of one other. So, if you died, for example, you don't transport to another completely different reality. I'm implying that it's closely related to the writing ""The egg"" by Andy Weir. Whether or not we're really a great being or not isn't what I'm going for here necessary. In the egg's perspective, consciousness in different vessels could just be connected somehow.",1593979893,astrophysics,Jehovahswetnips,Astrophysics,Comment,1177

That's an outcome worth thinking about. And I can see why it'd be more comforting to have just died because you died, but not really, you more or less got erased from reality as a new reality forms in your body. Leaving the impressions on this universe up to that body, leaving you with nothing. I understand. But my concern in actually making this happen, but that entails, as stated before, knowing ourselves. I do not believe our conscious to be the same as every living thing although there are similarities. The facts that 1. Our knowledge and cognitive prowess is vastly different than other animals.

You believe consciousness is just one large encompassment with the branches of animals differing. But wouldn't that create a dilemma (in your logic) and prove consciousness is indeed differing? That's like saying homosapiens are the same as Neanderthals, although there may be slight similarities, we are completely different.

6046,"Many people who answered you took your question a bit too literal, I think, so let me give a different opinion as somebody who is a research astrophysicist. The main purpose of  teaching maths in school and also in the first few semesters at university is not to teach you math as a set of rules that one applies, but rather it is to help you think in a clean and logical way. The fact that you also learn something about calculus, statistics, and so on is a secondary effect, but the most important skill that you have to have as a scientist is the way on how you approach and solve problems. Maths is a very good way to train these abilities, so if you are not good in terms of logical thinking and a systematic approach to problem solving, then you will be having problems as an astrophysicist as well. 

Note that this is very different from school maths - a large number of astronomers I know are very bad with memorizing things, regurgitating formulae, remembering different types of integrals and special functions and so on. The reason is that you can look these up. However, none of them are bad with respect to the deeper skills I mean above.

Narrowing your question down to what type of maths I need in my own work, as also said by people who answered your questions, which maths is most important depends a lot of the subfield you're working on. In my case as mainly an observer with some numerical work thrown in (accretion physics, compact objects, AGN, and things like that), I use advanced algebra and various numerical methods daily, calculus several times a week, differential geometry and tensors a few times a month. And I breathe classical and Bayesian statistics (which both have their place in the field, contrary to what some zealots are thinking ;) ).

6227,"&gt;So the Moon is spinning on its axis with something like 99% perfection in accordance with its orbit about Earth which is phenomenal. I love that, like...what are the odds, and how does something like that even happen? 

This is actually due to tidal forces. Originally, the moon *was* spinning relative to Earth's surface but it became stretched by gravity as it did, losing energy until it became tidally locked (one side always facing the Earth). This is actually a fairly common occurrence.

&gt;That star is super special: the sun spots that pop up on occasion are shown to move with differing radial velocities in accordance with their lattitude, proving that not only dies the Sun spin, but also that it spins with different frequency depending on how close you are to the equator or pole.

That's not entirely true. The frequency of the sun's rotation remains the same but the sun spots move slower further away from the poles because they have less distance to travel. For example, imagine a large beachball and two different sized hoops. One hoop can fit around the ""equator"" of the beach ball while the other is slightly smaller and would represent some line that is further north/south. These hoops would spin with the same frequency if attached to the ball yet their angular velocities would be different due to the difference in circumference.

&gt;there must be black matter or something... I'm not sure I want to get into that one...its still...pseudoscience? Nothing is proven?

Dark matter is not pseudoscience by any means. It's theoretical but our knowledge is still very much based on the scientific method.

Dark matter? There's observational evidence or ""proof"" but unfortunately we don't have enough of it to paint the picture (especially for  us GP). Imagine it like this... you go to open the door to a hotel room for this first time. Before the door can swing more than a few inches it hits something. Without opening the door any further you can tell me there's an object blocking the door but you can't tell me what it is. That's sort of where we're at (granted we can infer more using indirect evidence). In the case of the object behind the door we can make some assumptions like, ""it's not etheral"". Same stuff we're doing with dark matter.

There's no evidence at all about the initial singularity if that's how far you're going back. It's a place holder. Nothing to suggest anything about the source of the Big Bang, let alone that it physically spins.

&gt; do photons spin? I could totally see a beam of light spinning like it was shot from a gun with rifling.

Yeah, see nothing physically spins in quantum mechanics like it does in classic physics (thrown curve ball). It's math. Not physical rotation. So spin has different meaning. And that's about all I feel comfortable explaining. I'm sure there's quantum physics students/teachers that could go more in depth with that. I don't mind admitting that while I can see the numbers in what I read, I need the text. Like many others I was cursed with curiosity in many sciences and blessed with an aversion to math.

The central black hole is really negligible for the overall galaxy. Regular matter (stars, gas, ...) has way more mass than it. Dark matter (there is no black matter) is there as well.

Your problem is that you are focusing on concepts that are not part of GR, such at the concept of a gravitational force or of centrifugal forces - this is not how GR describes motion in the presence of masses or how GR describes the effects of coordinate transforms. 

Your main fallacy is that you are focusing on the concept of motion of the ""surface"" of the black hole \*through space\*. But this is not what black holes with an angular momentum are - i.e., your concept that a black hole that has angular momentum is rotating is not correct. It is a simplification that one uses when attempting to describe much more complex mathematical concepts. It is sometimes useful, but often it is not, and in your case it is not. In other words, and still using simplifications: if you look at the Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, the ""surface"" of the black hole is where space itself is dragged with the speed of light with respect to the outer region of the black hole. The important concept here is that of frame dragging, which has other consequences than artificial forces such as the centripetal force (which are a consequence of motion through space).

If you increase all masses by a factor x^(3), increase all distances by a factor x and increase all velocities by a factor x then you get the same dynamics in Newtonian mechanics. If x^(3)=100 then the distances need to increase by a factor ~5 and the velocities need to change by the same factor. At constant density the the diameter scales with the cube root of the mass, so the radius of most objects will scale with x as well.

This similarity was a big problem for astronomy for a while because it applies within the Solar System as well. If both distances and size can be larger by the same factor x then the (observable) angular diameter in the sky stays the same. The time for everything to happen (e.g. the length of a year) stays the same as well. So how can you measure any distance in the Solar System? Relative distances are easy, but you don't get an absolute scale that way.

People used the tiny parallax when looking at Venus transits from different places on Earth. That relates the size of Earth to the Earth/Venus/Sun distances.

6329,"Space itself is expanding which means between any 2 points in the universe space is being ""created"". The farther away an object is the more space is growing between them (so it appears to be moving faster away from each other).

This expansion (aka creation) of space is accelerating which means as time passes more space is created between those two points. Say, 1 million years ago there was created 1 cm of space between 2 points separated by 1 m. Nowadays 1.5 cm is created between 2 points separated by 1 m. These numbers are just an example.

We don't know exactly what causes this expansion and how it will evolve (we call it dark energy but we don't know that it is).

Now, please note that according to our current understanding the universe did not always expand at a linear rate either. There was a period early in the universe where it grew exponentially, much faster than today. We call that process Inflation, and we're not sure what caused it.

Basically it grew super mega fast (aka a lot of space was created between things), and eventually it slowed down in the acceleration and today it's expanding at a slower rate.

Note the Big Bang isn't an usual explosion with things pushing others out, the expansion of the universe is basically space being created everywhere. The Big Bang \*is\* this expansion of the Universe.

A side note: like I said because space is being created everywhere the farther something is the more space is created between the 2 points. So they ""drift"" apart from each other at great speeds. There is a point where this speed is faster than light so basically these two points can't see each other because their light can't ever reach the other. This created something called a cosmic horizon. This is what happens in the universe - we can only see a very small part of it, the part that is close enough for light to be faster than the drifting apart. As the expansion of the universe accelerates we will see less and less as the farther regions we can see today won't be visible then.

A possible fate for the universe is the Big Rip, the expansion continues to accelerate to a point where even particles can't contact with each other as they're moving faster than light from each other.

6392,"&gt;the emergence of complex creation is statistically impossible to attain blindly without agency

This is not objective thinking. There are literally countless planets in the universe yet we have only found evidence for life on 1 so far. It is definitely *unlikely* for life to develop but it's still absolutely *possible*.

I recommend looking into the origins of early life because it's not like humans suddenly sprung out of the ground and were granted intelligence by some omnipotent creator. The process was much, *much* slower and life has had plenty of time to evolve through natural selection to develop complex structures that have only recently (on a cosmological scale) begun to develop what we call consciousness.

&gt;we deduce that there is an intelligence behind all this

Yes but not in the way you think. The ""intelligence"" of life is essentially the same principle as machine learning. It improves without consciousness through trial and error to become better at fulfilling certain parameters (i.e. stay alive long enough to reproduce). However, unlike most computers, life has had a couple billion years of random, unthinking trial and error to perfect itself and become more and more complex.

The biggest nail in the coffin is that life still isn't perfect.

6395,"In a white hole the event horizon exists: it's the point where nothing can enter the white hole, not even light.

So basically a white hole is a perfect mirror: it reflects everything and nothing can ever enter.

This also means that it expels anything that is inside it, and this is a problem for their stability. If it is not part of a wormhole then it's hard to imagine what happens. Maybe they vanish instantly in a bang of radiation while spewing out everything.

If they're part of a wormhole then you will not only see the reflections of radiation coming back at you from your part of the universe but also any radiation that entered the wormhole in the other side. So basically the event horizon would be a spherical ""screen"" to the other part of where the wormhole is (and any further radiation reflected).

However, this would probably not be that simple too. Because particles inside the white whole would be in a space time moving faster than light and that the white whole will likely be spinning too, means they can get energy from the white hole similar to ergospheres around black holes. So basically instead of a nice window to the other side you would see a super energetic version of what was in the other side. A massive burst of high energy radiation.

Add other effects like the Unruh radiation and basically what we expect from a White Hole would be a super powerful source of high energy radiation and something that disappears in a blink of an eye to their own instability.

There were some hypothesis that some events (like high energy gamma ray bursts) are actually white holes appearing and disappearing, but most physicists don't agree with that.

Basically white holes require weird stuff like negative energy and even in that case we have no idea how quantum gravity works, and the nature of white holes (and the singularities of black holes) depends massively on that gravity works at that level. In short, we don't know if whites holes are even possible and even if they are how they should work, and what weird exotic physics necessary for them to exist actually exists.",1592994432,astrophysics,JFDCamara,Astrophysics,Comment,371

helped explain religious concepts in a scientific way. Take all these with a grain of salt, it’s how my brain drew connections during this lockdown. A few examples.

It’s said that on the day of judgement, it’s gonna be scorching hot on earth, as if the sun were right overhead. In billions of years when the sun is in its red giant phase, it will expand massively and earth surface temperatures will skyrocket, and it is possible that it gets engulfed by the sun - complete end of the world. The tidal forces of this sun - although it will have lost mass - will be much stronger due to being closer to earth. This explains the extremely strong winds, evaporation of oceans, and land flying off as told in religious traditions.

As crazy as this sounds, I think the afterworld (heaven and hell) is a black hole. Firstly, except for religious figures (by the intervention of God Himself), no one has ever escaped the afterlife and come back to earth. Similarly, nothing, not even light, can escape the intense gravity of a black hole, and we can’t see what’s inside of it. Next, it’s said that for us humans, heaven or hell will literally go on forever, both in the essence of physical space and time-wise. This might be explained by singularities: although our understanding of the current laws of physics breaks down while discussing them, and we will never know for sure what lies inside a singularity, from what we understand, a singularity may be an infinite curvature of spacetime.

Thus, along with Earth’s electric field, the magnetosphere is able to deflect almost all incoming winds. 

Interesting enough, the winds really are so strong they even changed the shapes of our magnetosphere.",1592970647,astrophysics,sid_vig,Astrophysics,Comment,117

6555,"Temperature gradients exist within stars due to energy transport within said stars. The way the energy is transported depends on certain conditions within each section of the star but we generally consider either radiative or convective modes of transportation. Note that we can have stars that have some areas being convective while some areas are radiative, it is also possible to observe fully convective stars. 

Depending on whether a section is radiative or convective, we can use different equations to describe the temperature gradient of that section. If a section is radiative then we understand that photons carry energy outward via collisions; we thus must consider the opacity of the material within the section. I recommend reading though this Wiki page and googling more about radiative transport if you are curious. 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation\_zone#:\~:text=Temperature%20gradient,-In%20a%20radiative&amp;text=Hence%20the%20opacity%20(%CE%BA)%20and,a%20slow%20flow%20of%20energy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_zone#:~:text=Temperature%20gradient,-In%20a%20radiative&amp;text=Hence%20the%20opacity%20(%CE%BA)%20and,a%20slow%20flow%20of%20energy.) 

Radiative transport tends to break down when the opacity of material, or the luminosity in that section, are too high. This is because both of these cases perturb the delicate hyrdostatic equilibrium established within the star. This results in convective transport becoming dominant.

We can use models to describe roughly when convection becomes dominant over radiative energy transportation. This leads us to the Schwarzchild Criterion; this requires a few approximations to reach but is fairly accurate.

Build two identical clocks that tick at the same rate in whichever units you wish, but leave one on Earth and put the other in orbit. When you compare the amount of thicks after a while, you will see that the clock in orbit has accumulated more of them than the one on Earth.

6580,"Well, I'd start by watching some key youtube videos, and also picking up a series of introductory type books, such as intro to physics, Algebra1, Algebra2, pre-calculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, etc... 

Personally: I found the ""Dummies"" book series to actually be really good on those topics, simply in terms of just give you a good introductory foundation. But... a lot of people will laugh when I mention that book series on those topics... 

So fair enough: in that regard, just find whatever introductory book series is right for you! 

--------------------------------

NOTE: 

While reading those introductory books, you can just them quickly from cover to cover, to start. Maybe sit down, next to your favorite cat, with a glass of wine, and read the book over the course of a weekend... 

ALL while NOT worrying about memorizing anything, or even understanding half of what they're talking about! 

Initially you'll be like: what!? I'll never learn all this!? But that's normal! 

Next, after you've skimmed through the introductory books, you can then go back and read them more slowly.  (While also watching some youtube mathematics and physics teaching videos along side the books.) 

--------------------------------

ALSO: learn Python programming! 

Python is used a lot now in the sciences and astronomy. 

Again: just have fun with it, learn the very basics... and gradually build from there slowly. 

If you're really enjoying python then you can go crazy and learn the basic-subset of C++ (without learning all the other whack of complex features that C++ has.) 

NOTE: only a few people on Earth actually learn ALL of C++. For the rest of us, we just learn a smaller subset of the language, including the basics (which is easy to learn). 

And then if a project suddenly needs a more complex feature of C++, then the person will learn it then. 

--------------------------------

FINALLY the more fun part: 

Kick back, relax, and watch lots of great cosmological/astronomical videos on youtube!

[NASA Space Flight](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/)

[Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/)

[Phys.Org](https://phys.org/)

--------------------------------

NOTE: of the list I made above, you'll probably learn the most initially from Fraser Cain's youtube channel. 

Also, Isaac Arthur's channel is an AMAZING and really fun look into the future of humanity in space, and what might be plausibly possible, based upon current known physics. 

--------------------------------

Start with that, and from there you'll soon enough know where to go from there... 

Such as for example, whether or not you just want Cosmology to be a fun hobby... or if you want to make a career in the field. 

NOTE: to get your foot into the door later on... the best way into the field for a non-scientist, in my opinion: start by volunteering to program/code for astro-related projects and professors, using things such as Python, and/or C++. 

Many professors say they are DESPERATE for coders to help them with projects. Without much experience you'd probably have to start as a volunteer... but if you're decent, then they'll fight to get you a salary to stay on the project, as again, a lot of them are desperate for coders these days.",1592553915,astrophysics,Radio_Free_Galactica,Astrophysics,Comment,544

6607,"&gt;Where? Only speed per distance is meaningful. The larger the distance you consider the larger the speed.

I'm really confused by your speed per distance term, the speed is light soeed, it is contant, is it not? Where does the distance factor into this.  

Going back to your previous example, are you saying in iyou example that a 30M light year away galaxy is the speed of light  + 700 km/s or what exactly?

&gt;At a distance of 46 billion light years today.

How is it that you can have simetuhg at a distance if 46B years if the universe is only 13.8B years old

&gt;The expansion of space is not the motion of objects in space. It's additional space being made between the objects. The speed of light is not a limit for the expansion of the universe in any way.

If this is the answer to the previous question, then I yet ask how is it that if expansion is not in time since it is not bound by light speed that we can look at the universe at any point near or at the big bang when all the universe is equally old. How is it that by looking at a distance you can get closer to the bug bang when it is from that explosion and its expansion that glalaxies were kater created unless the big bang is still emitting stuff out. I don't see how is it possible to look into the past before creation by that which is created, since by its creation the past is already past.",1592482449,astrophysics,Yidam,Astrophysics,Comment,264

6610,"Hi, I think the discussion on the disparity between media/pop culture portrayel of DM/dark energy and scientific consensus is really interesting! Take into account that this consensus is significantly different between when talking about dark matter and dark energy - dark energy is more like a potential cause for the cosmological constant that we observe, dark matter is simply matter that doesn't react with light, and we see a lot of that in many different observations.
Even though they are very different, people often like coming up with alternative theories, I'm not really sure why.

For a fun starter, you might look at the public perception of alternative theories for dark matter for example (e.g. the widely criticized Milgrom's MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Emergent gravity from Verlinde, and how people reacted on learning about these theories).",1592475700,astrophysics,sight19,Astrophysics,Comment,137

6613,"Not be demeaning or anything, but you need to revamp your EE ideas immediately. Your topics do not deal with any physics at all. You’re sole concentration is on factors that are not even physics related. For example ‘Media portrayal’ and ‘Socio-Economic’ factors. Sounds like you’re doing a Lang and Lit EE. If you are interested in astrophysics or any physics topics stick to what physics terminology and phenomena you know and have studied about. You can apply your knowledge to these topics. 

You want to pick up a topic and see what physics factors affect an application of that topic. Then you want to find relations between these factors or compare the two or try to formulate your idea of finding a relationship between these factors. 

Now if you still feel you don’t want to change your topics, I suggest you change your EE subject as doing this will have severe repercussions. Physics EE has very rigid and high grade boundaries. Your topics only involve face value of fancy physics theories. No science or actual math behind it. So I suggest you do something simple. Because there is no way you will find any experiments or secondary data for dark matter or energy. The only possibility is theoretical, but I doubt it will get you high grades.

So first take some time and understand whether physics is the right subject for you. Then decide on feasible topics that involve actual physics. 

Consider this as an advice from your M20 senpai who finished his EE in astrophysics. 

Finally, I’m sorry if I sound a bit harsh but I really hope the best for you. You are at an early stage of your EE so you can still make changes. I have know few friends who had to resolve to really bad topics because they had superficial topics like ‘how do gravitational waves affect space-time.’

&gt;In short you don't seem educated in it. To properly understand modern cosmology you need to have studied 5 years worth of university physics. Until then a statement whether you ""like big bang theory"" has no value whatsoever.

&gt;Meanwhile here in reality, the big bang theory (the universe starting out hot and dense, then expanding and cooling, and a very detailed understanding of the processes happening from early on) is an established scientific fact, most obviously seen in the cosmic microwave background.

&gt;With the contents cosmologists have determined the universe  to have it will expand at an accelerating rate and there is no evidence for either slowing expansion or even recollapse. The evidence suggests otherwise and in physics evidence is king. The claims that a black hole should cause another big bang is also very much baseless. Do you have any math supporting this? I don't think so.

It’s tempting to want to do these super-interesting topics which are beyond what is expected of you in the IB Physics course. However, you don’t want to go crazy. Don’t get me wrong, doing an EE in a complex topic is great if you you want a challenge, but you should ask yourself if your topics and research questions allow for what the IB asks for in a Physics EE. Analyzing the disparity between science and popular media or the one about government funding are not adequate topics for an EE. The one about “What can we learn from dark matter?” is on the right track, but it’s too broad. You want to be much more specific about what you want to investigate. As a student, you are expected to ask a question that allows for analysis (numerical or otherwise), discussion of your methodology, and a discussion of your results. My advice would be for you to just relax and enjoy the summer before IB starts. If you want to get a head start, though, you can look at IB Physics topics + options and look for ideas there. I based mine on the application of the principles of electromagnetic induction (Topic 11) for spacecraft charging. I also recommend that you look at the official IB Physics Extended Essay guide, it has everything you’re expected to do plus the criteria for your assessment. Remember that you’ll need an EE advisor, and you’ll have to run everything by him. So, like I said, enjoy your summer and don’t stress over the EE for now.

1--2-3-4--5

1----2--3--4----5

1--------2----3----4--------5

...and so on. So from the perspective of galaxy 3 galaxies 1 and 5 are moving away twice as fast as 2 and 4. 

But from the perspective of galaxy 2 galaxy 4 is moving away twice as fast as galaxy 3. kinda like this:

-1----0--1-2-3--4----5

(Edit: using negative 1 here is a formatting nightmare, shoulda started with higher numbers but hopefully the point still gets across) the numbers just represent separate galaxies, including number 0...


So every galaxy looks like it's in the center and everything expands outwards.

This is dependent on whether or not stray protons decay into more elementary particles. If they do, they will be the ones that hold the last sources of significant potential energy after black holes fizzle out through Hawking radiation. 

For our intents and purposes, a proton would theoretically decay into a positron and a neutral pion, and that pion would decay into photons in the Gamma area of the EM spectrum.

6681,"&gt; a small, bright star that is orbiting a larger, dimmer star.

This is from the view of the planet? Because the larger star will be brighter in absolute terms for conditions that would lead to a hospitable planet.

The stars orbit their common center of mass. The mass ratio won't be so large that you could say ""x orbits y"".

A red giant that would occupy a relevant fraction of the sky will heat your planet too much. At a surface temperature of 3000 K (won't get much lower than that) you still have 1/16 the surface brightness of the Sun. If the red giant appears 4 times as large as the Sun in the sky (by diameter) it will already deliver as much heat as the Sun does. That's only two degrees diameter.

Bad news: there is no way to get a masters or PhD in astro or physics without a STEM undergraduate degree. No reputable program (or any program) would accept someone with just a BA in marketing, as you just don't have the necessary math. Not sure how much math you took, but at a minimum you need single, multivariable, and vector calculus; linear algebra; differential equations; and Fourier series. In addition to kinematics, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, modern physics, lab courses, etc. You'd need to go back and get another undergraduate degree (almost definitely a BS, but you might be able to get by with a BA) before you would be eligible for graduate programs.

Good news: you can still work in the field! Science needs *lots* of people and they don't all need to be scientists! Science education and public outreach is really important.

6710,"Well, there are techniques to compensate for survey bias, but they tend to be prone to errors and often we are lacking the information that is needed to apply the corrections in the first place.

There are many reasons why this poses a problem. Let me give you a simple example: we know from the solar neighborhood that there are huge numbers of low mass stars. But how many there are was and is still unknown, because virtually all surveys for stars are flux limited. This has practical reasons, since observing faint objects takes much more observing time than brighter objects. The consequence was that in the 1950s we knew on the order of 1000 stars out to 20pc (that was the number of stars in the first Gliese catalogue of nearby stars), while today the number of known stars in that volume  exceeds 3300. So a large number of the stellar population was unknown and therefore earlier estimates of the galaxy's stellar density and also the mass distribution of stars were wrong. As a result we still are not sure how many low mass stars there are in our Galaxy - the local distribution of stars might be very different from that in other regions of the Galaxy, because it depends on the history of star formation, so while we can try to correct for that, it is very difficult.

A similar problem exists in extragalactic astronomy: we know from observations of the vicinity of our Milky Way (the Local Group), that most galaxies are dwarf galaxies: The Local Group contains Andromeda, the Milky Way, and the Triangulum Galaxy as larger spiral galaxies, and then at least 50 low mass galaxies (irregulars, dwarf spheroidal galaxies and so on). While most of the mass of the Local Group is in the large galaxies, understanding the dwarf galaxies are crucial for our understanding of galaxy formation. Virtually all of our knowledge of these systems comes from the Local Group, however, they are only representative for our small corner of the universe and they might behave very different, e.g., in galaxy clusters or even in other galaxy groups. 

These are just two prominent examples of the problems of flux limited samples, but I hope they illustrate the problem.",1592073857,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,376

You can have dilation due to both, but when dealing with black holes, that is, gravitation, the dilation due to motion is ""incorporated"" in the general relativistic analysis.  You don't need to treat them separately.

&gt;What would the singularity (or the way there) be like? 

Like death.

We don't know.  Singularity signifies the breaking point of the theory: we don't know what it is, physically.  Personally, I'm fairly certain it ain't gonna be a soft and squishy thingy wanting to hug and kiss me, so I'll call it death until more data becomes available :-)   


The way there is basically an excercise in disintegration -- and the process would, in a realistic scenario (accretion disks around the BH etc), begin far outside the blackhole.  What ends up in the singularity is, as far as I know,  elementary particles.  If you'll allow an uneducated guess, it could be all bosonic (""pure energy"") by the time it reaches the very center.  


With that said, you might be interested in the [visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuCJ8s_xMnI) from [professor Hamilton](https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/bh/schw.html).  

&gt;Do you get a nice view there or is it just emptiness?

Between the event horizon and the singularity, stuff that fell with you would still be falling with you; but otherwise, it should be empty.  But you'd probably be in pieces, or in pieces of the pieces, as per above.  This, too, however, depends on the mass of the BH you're falling into -- the supermassive ones allow for more interesting storytelling ...   


&gt;Could you explain this?

6725,"The whole black hole theory that they keep shrinking and shrinking past the known existence of matter and all three dimensional known properties doesn’t really seem all that likely. Black holes have come and gone in many drastically different masses for a very very very long time. There’s mathematics and even direct observations that back that up (at least the tiny black holes observed in a lab). 

Right now we can be sure of a few things although they’re unproven and never will be.

The universe is moving away from itself at increasing rates. It’s not just expanding as fast as since the theorized Big Bang... it’s getting *faster*. A lot of this is because the universe isn’t expanding per-say. It’s more of a “filling itself with itself” while everything still moves farther apart... if that makes any sense.

This means it’s very likely that everything will finitely expand until all subatomic particles in the universe have ceased to exist. Energy will cease to exist. Everything. Think of it like this:

A supernova explodes and gives birth to 40 stars. 3 in 40 of those stars goes supernova and makes another 20 stars. 2 of those 20 stars go nova or supernova and makes another 10. 1 of those 10 goes supernova or nova and makes another 5.

It obviously doesn’t happen quite like that, but the concept of so much energy only able to give back the opportunity of less than its original energy eventually brings all things to a halt. No new stars will be born. Then galaxies would slowly fade away. After trillions of years all the stars that have lived the longest will fade. Then after trillions more all their energy will keep dividing and separating until even the atoms themselves do and their particles and possibly even lower levels of this will eventually... run out. 

I always thought of the Big Bang as a supernova on a grander scale within a much larger universe. And we could never detect that other universe because we’re so insanely small on the scale of our universe that even the nearest thing to whatever caused the Big Bang would be so incomprehensibly far away that even the universe wouldn’t have time to know its existence.

6771,"&gt;Assume I'm falling into a black hole, but survive things like radiation, heat, spaghettification etc. 

This is not an assumption you can make. 

Suppose a distant observer is watching you fall feet first into a black hole. They see you slow down as you approach the event horizon due to time dilation. Your feet are always closer than your head, and so always approach the horizon more slowly, the net effect is that they see you pancake. Over a long period of time, they see black hole evaporate and the event horizon shrink. As it shrinks, you follow it down, but never cross it. As it shrinks more and more, and the Hawking radiation becomes more and more intense, they loose sight of you in the Hawking radiation in the last seconds of the black hole's existence. They will see all this play out over time scales of 10\^64 - 10\^106 years, depending on the mass of the black hole.

You'll see basically the same thing form your perspective, except that you wont be pancaked, and it will be on time scales of seconds to hours depending on the size of the black hole. As the black hole shrinks away from you, the tidal forces and the hawking radiation will increase basically without bound.

6772,"&gt;When you fall into a black hole, time passes much slower for you, so does this mean you would see a ""movie"" of the future of the universe sped up?

No, this is a common misconception.

No; the significant thing here is not so much the time dilation due to relativistic velocities, but due to gravitation itself.  Time is dilated closer to a source of gravitation, and at the event horizon the dilation becomes infinite (from a distant observers frame of reference, that is).  The [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time) for you would still tick just like it always has, always does -- you would be living one second per second according to anything you might have for reference in your immediate surroundings (""your local frame"").  And after passing the event horizon (in fact, even after passing the photon sphere which is further out) you would end up in the singularity; in milliseconds, or maybe aeons, depends on how massive the BH you fell into. 

There is a perspective where the actual collapse and then an immediate rebounce of a star could be seen as a very short event that just gets time dilated to \~infinity from the POV of the outside universe.

Compared to something travelling at the speed of light, they are travelling at 1s/s but one second hasn’t passed yet.  And never will.   But to our time frame, it travels at c.

That’s a periodic change in signal, so a Fourier transform would be a natural manipulation. I don’t really know how it would give you any extra information (light curves are also periodic, but are often quite easy to interpret, and their odd u-shaped form probably isn’t well-suited to be described by a Fourier transform). The raw signal will give you the period easily enough. A Fourier transform might make that a bit easier, but it’s not the only way to get at it. We can already get at least a lower limit on the mass (inclination is often unknown, so we are stuck with a sin(i) coefficient). This is all also related to the semi-major axis. You don’t normally get the radius of the planet with radial velocity measurements. Light curves easily give that information. I don’t see a way to use a Fourier transform to get that from radial velocity data, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.

It seems to me that perhaps the most useful application of a Fourier transform would be to find noise. The star itself may be oscillating and convecting significantly, instruments will have noise, etc. All of this will pollute the radial velocity fluctuations that are actually caused by the planet. If you do a Fourier transform of the signal then you might be able to isolate those signals better and use that information to help mitigate that noise. Maybe you could find that there’s evidence for stellar oscillations at a given frequency found by the Fourier transform. Then you could subtract that signal out. Something like that. It’s possible that this could also be applied to light curves, especially if the star has significant, periodic luminosity fluctuations.

I'll give you a tip bit of info.  Bob claims to have worked in the '80's on reverse engineering the propulsion mechanism for an alien spacecraft.  According to Bob, the propulsion mechanism, a gravitational field generator, required element 115 to run.  The interesting thing about his story is that when he first broke is silence in, I believe 1989, element 115 was not known to science.  It wasn't until the early 2000's that element 115 was discovered and officially recognized as a new element.  Now, the interesting thing about Bob's story is that he was able to describe pretty much all of the properties of element 115 in 1989, before human-kind even knew about it.  There's also a documentary on Netflix about Bob's story, which has already been smeared by ""reviews"", no surprise there.  Anyway, I personally find Bob to be believable.

6875,"Umm I think you can but probably more advanced (I'd struggle to do it and I have an astrophysics masters!) 

However, the light curves I assume you have will essentially have a periodic dip in brightness. This dip will be because of the planet actually getting in the way of the star between us and the star, so it blocks out a certain amount of the light of the star. To start with, you can plot the brightness against time by looking at it - if you see a dip in brightness over and over with a similar separation period, there's likely a planet. You can also take a Fourier transform though (essentially look at brightness against frequency instead of brightness against time) and you should see a peak around about the period of the orbit. 

Once you've found the dips you can use the width and depth of it to get properties of the planet.

In addition, here's some amazing websites to learn more about space, and related sciences: 

[Centauri Dreams](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/)

[Universe Today](https://www.universetoday.com/)

[Space Flight Now](https://spaceflightnow.com/)

[NASA Space Flight](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/)

[Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/)

[Phys.Org](https://phys.org/)

--------------------------------

NOTE: of the list I made above, you'll probably learn the most initially from Fraser Cain's youtube channel. 

Isaac Arthur's channel is an AMAZING and really fun look into the future of humanity in space, and what might be plausibly possible, based upon current known physics. 

Further, the comment section of the articles on Centauri Dreams has LOTS of actual scientists debating, arguing, and discussing the topic, so you will learn TONS by reading the comments. 

(Don't worry if you don't understand a lot of the terms and topics for the first few months--takes a bit of time to learn the lingo.) 

--------------------------------

BUT YA... 

Perhaps in the next few years, after you've learned a bit more math/physics, you could indeed very well formulate and publish an important scientific paper. 

In addition in the meantime: 

Consider learning the Python computer programming language.

Python is a lot of fun to learn, and has a huge library of template programs, and plug-in-modules, that you can use to make programs to visualize and demonstrate your theories/hypothesis. 

Python is used extensively by scientists/engineers to do calculations for new theories, and new engineering projects. 

--------------------------------

Also, if learning Python programming goes really well, you can also bite the bullet, and learn a base-line subset version of C++ programming. 

C++ is also used in a lot of engineering and science, and is able to perform advanced calculations super-fast. 

But... the problem with C++, is that it's a bit intimidating for newbies, and it's INSANELY COMPLEX if you try to learn the entire language and all it's features perfectly. 

But the thing is: not many people on planet Earth need to learn or use the entire C++ programming language! Nope. 

INSTEAD: Most people just learn a subset of C++, and then from there, if they need to learn about any additional special features of the language for a specific project, then they'll learn it then. 

But otherwise, if they don't need to use a special feature, then they won't bother learning it, because again: otherwise you'll go insane trying to learn everything about C++!",1591574855,astrophysics,Synaptic_Impulse,Astrophysics,Comment,498

6885,"Well, your passion for space science, cosmology, and physics, all at the age of 17, is AMAZING! 

I really hope you continue in this field, since you have a passion for it! 

--------------------------------

However, I could be wrong here... 

But at such a young age, I'm guessing you might not have the mathematical skills, or physics knowledge yet, to put your string theory hypothesis into an actual formula, or set of formulas... 

In other words (again, I could be wrong) but I don't think you have the ability to describe them in relation to Newtonian and Quantum physics, in order to explain how your hypothesis acts to trigger the effects we see in everyday life, or when we look out into the Universe with telescopes. 

--------------------------------

So does that mean the base-foundation of your hypothesis is wrong? No: you might be right! 

Or, you could indeed be wrong. 

Very often science works in which someone comes up with a ""brilliant new hypothesis"" and they begin formulating it mathematically (and/or do experiments), and they suddenly discover: 

""Wow, I was wrong! But... I just noticed something else... what the heck: why I am seeing these unexpected strange new mathematical or experimental results here? What's going on?"" 

And then THAT is exactly what leads to a newer, revised, and better hypothesis, that then sometimes gets elevated to a new theory that shocks the physics world! 

--------------------------------

ALSO: some people will come up with new hypothesis, but instead of formulating it mathematically, in relation to known physics about how the universe appears to work... 

They just sit down and write a fictional SciFi novel, story, or TV series instead, using the hypothesis-idea! 

Some of these fictional physics hypothesis, or fictional engineering devices, next then go on to influence real scientist and engineers, and become reality, or inspire/lead them to new discoveries! 

So that's 2 different ways you can tell the world about your new hypothesis for string theory: 

1) Through a scientific paper that you publish. 

2) Or through a great-cool new fictional story, that then goes on to influence scientists and engineers. 

--------------------------------

FINALLY: in the meantime, you should LEARN all the mathematics and physics you can. 

You can start with easy simple introductions to things like pre-calculus, calculus, linear algebra, geometry, etc... 

Personally, I found the book series ""Pre-Calculus for Dummies"", ""Calculus 1 for Dummies"" etc... to be really great at introducing and quickly teaching me the basic foundations of those mathematics. 

(But people always laugh at me when I recommend the Dummies book series to the younger generation... so if you don't like that series you can find other book series, or even lots of introduction videos on youtube.)

------------------------------------

Good luck! 

And I hope you will either write a great SciFi novel one day, explaining your hypothesis in the fictional universe of the novel, and maybe inspire scientists... 

Or I hope you become an astrophysicist yourself one day, and create a new theory of the Universe! 

But either way: it will take LOTS OF HARD WORK to get there, such as learning more math and physics, and/or practicing your writing skills, and fiction skills, etc... depending upon what path you select.",1591561176,astrophysics,Synaptic_Impulse,Astrophysics,Comment,531

6995,"The ""no-hair"" theorem states that a black hole is completely described by just three quantities: its mass, its angular momentum (related to how fast it's spinning) and its electric charge. This means that any black hole with a certain mass, angular momentum and electric charge will, from the outside, be indistinguishable from another with the same mass, angular momentum and electric charge - so if we somehow made a black hole  with the same mass, angular momentum and electric charge as one out there in nature, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

Now, we could (this being quite a loose usage of ""could"", mind you) make a black hole that isn't really characteristic of any that occur naturally; since the natural processes that give rise to their creation require you to have a lot of matter all in one place to begin with (eg. the core of a collapsing supergiant star), the smallest they get is about a few times the mass of the Sun. You get these ""stellar-mass"" black holes up to a few tens of times the mass of the sun. At the top end supermassive black holes found at the centres of galaxies range from hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of the sun. For a long time, it wasn't known if there were any black holes with masses between these two categories (\~100s-10000s of solar masses), though recently a number of candidates for such intermediate-mass black holes have been detected.

It's also possible that miniature black holes (i.e. smaller than can conceivably be created in known astrophysical processes) could have been produced in the very exotic conditions in the moments after the Big Bang. However, as black holes slowly evaporate over time (and more rapidly the smaller they are - this is called Hawking radiation), the smallest such a remnant primordial black hole which has survived to the present could be is probably about 100-1000 times the mass of the Great Pyramid at Giza. So, if we could somehow make a black hole with a mass that's not characteristic of (i.e. smaller than) any of these naturally-occurring categories, it's likely that it would be different from any we'd find in nature.

On top of this, it's not known if there are actually any black holes out there which are electrically charged - maybe if any start with charge, they end up attracting oppositely-charged stuff and end up becoming electrically neutral pretty quickly. So, if we could somehow make a charged black hole, it's possible that it would differ in this respect from any natural black holes that are out there.",1591229363,astrophysics,colonelkusak,Astrophysics,Comment,439

No: Black holes don't have a composition, at least not one we would know of or could measure. They only have mass, spin, and in principle they can have an electric charge but in practice it's negligible.

Yes: The only known way to create natural black holes is gravitational collapse of stellar remnants. This produces black holes with a mass of 3 times the Sun or more. It might be possible to produce slightly lighter ones, but it's still more mass than the Sun.

7041,"So, I did some ROTC in college while getting my degree, and I know a few people that went from physics to the military. I also grew up in a military family. I have plenty of experience with this, and 6 years ago had an almost identical conversation but I was on your side of it; thankfully someone talked me out of it. 

If you decide to go into the military with physics, first off make sure you pick a branch that will utilize that skill. Army and Marines are not going to really build on those skills at all. Navy and air force are much more likely. Space Force would probably be the best if you get the astronomy part. My dad had a degree in chemistry, and guess what he did in the army? Cav scout. He was super proud, but at the same time totally lost his math and science skill set. When he got blown up in Afganistan, it ended his career in science with multiple traumatic brain injuries and physical disabilities. He will never do science again. 

I would add that you will be able to use your experience and make more money by going into industry. Weapon companies like Lockheed and Boeing pay much more and dont expect you to spend months if not years training in skills totally unrelated to physics. My friends that went into weapon industry seem happier and more scientific than my friends that went in as officers. 

I wouldn't want to really recommend either of these paths though. You would be better off getting an engineering degree for most of these. 

Finally, I would not suggest using patriotism and family ties as a reason to choose this as a career. The truth is that every presidential administration produces a vastly different army culture. The army that your mom, dad, grandparents, ect served with is not the same army you would be enlisting in today. Things they loved might not be there, and you may be very disappointed to discover that. 

You sound young and please dont take this the wrong way. You will develop an incredibly special set of skills by studying physics. With those skills you can do many things. Study the universe, build humanity, save lives. What do you think the army will use your talents for?

7048,"Hi! I'm an astronomer, and I've worked in a variety of fields. Here's some feedback on your question.

First of all, as others have said, there's life beyond NASA and SpaceX :-) In particular, SpaceX has nothing to do with astrophysics. They've launched some research satellites built by other folks, but they don't work on that themselves; their work is mostly focused on telecoms and spaceflight.

If you want to combine research and space technology, ESA is a great option. They've led amazing missions like Planck, which mapped the Cosmic Microwave Background, Gaia, which is revolutionising stellar astrophysics, Rosetta, which landed on a comet, and many others. An engineering background would be desirable, but it's not mandatory, there are many researchers who end up getting involved in space missions coming from an academic background.

Something similar happens with ground-based observatories. I worked for ESO, where I combined my own research with observatory work: supporting observations, leading instrument teams, etc. This is a good way to learn the ins and outs of astronomical instrumentation development.

There are many other career paths, check out this link:

[http://www.jobsforastronomers.com/careers](http://www.jobsforastronomers.com/careers)

My own path was rather ""classic"": I graduated in Physics and got a PhD in astrophysics in Spain, then held two postdoctoral research positions in the US and Chile, then a staff position in Chile, and now I'm working for the IAU on astronomy education coordination.

That being said, I must warn you that it's unlikely to end up working in academic research. I'm not telling you this to discourage you; quite the opposite. There's this myth in academia that if you get a PhD, academia is only possible path. However, the number of new academic positions has not grown nearly as fast as the number of new PhDs, so it's statistically unlikely to get a job like that. Many researchers refer to other paths as ""alternative paths"", which often misleads students into thinking that if they don't get a job in academia they've failed, and this leads to a lot of unnecessary frustration.

My advice: identify what you want to do, and prepare for that in advance. Graduating in physics is a must. A PhD is required for research positions, but not for other jobs. You do learn a great deal while doing a PhD, but it's not necessarily the shortest path for other jobs.

Space agencies and ground-based observatories offer internships for students at various stages. This is a great way to get a feel about how research and science operations work.

Also, remember that your path isn't fixed, and it's totally ok to change your mind later on and do something else. The key is to be proactive and build your CV towards the job you want to land.

7050,"It would depend on how dense the moon is and what it is made out of. This is because the size of the moon would depend on how much space the moon would take up, and what kind of matter (How reflective the moon is) the moon is made from.

For simplicity's sake, let's say our baseline has the mass and visual appearance exactly of our moon. The moon in our potential view here would be 2-3 times more massive than Earth's moon, and 5 times closer. Brightness and perceived area decreases with the square of the distance, and perceived size decreases linearly with distance. So, that being said, it would appear about 100-225 times as bright and 10-15x the size as Earth's moon would be, assuming the star has the same luminosity as the sun. The orbital period for the moon would be \~2.5 days. You'd probably be able to see it moving across the sky and change phases as it orbits the planet.

For reference: On Earth, Light reflected from the sun by the moon is about 400,000 times dimmer than sunlight.

Our moon would only be 1/4000 - 1/1775 the brightness of the sun in this case. Assuming the closeness of this moon to the planet doesn't result in significant natural disasters, the night sky would be a little dimmer/brighter than what most would consider twilight to be when the moon is full. It would get dimmer as the moon changes phases over the evening/day and becomes more/less visible. You'd likely have a moonrise and moonset color contrast in the sky as the moon rises above and dips below the horizon depending on what phase the moon is at when it rises and sets.

If it DOES result in natural disasters, well, it'd likely be filled with clouds from the extreme hurricanes due to the large oceans and volcanic ash from the ridiculous tectonic activity due to the massive object influencing the planet.

7053,"If you're going for complete realism, it's not possible as far as I'm aware. Speeds like this only occur in extremely small asteroids that tumble chaotically moreso than precede about a fixed axis. From what I've been reading, the rate is determined based on the relationship of the mass of planets and their moons, tidal forces, and how close the system is to the parent star. For example, Mars' axial precession rate is closer to 125,000 years, and it's 1/3 the size of Earth. It has two very small moons (A few miles across at best), and has little to no liquid water, making gravitational and tidal influence significantly less.  Like you said in your post though, it's fantasy. You can make whatever system have whatever properties you want!

That being said, if you wanted to have something close to this, your planet would need an extremely massive moon relative to the system orbiting quite close to the planet, be in the habitable zone of the star its orbiting around while being close to it, and be mostly liquid for the maximum amount of torque from tides.

So maybe your planet is 90% water, orbits a small red dwarf star at \~ 15,000,000 miles out, and has a moon 1/3-1/2 the mass of itself orbiting at 1/5th the distance that the moon would orbit the Earth at.",1591040026,astrophysics,Generation3529,Astrophysics,Comment,227

Our axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees, and it rotates about that true invisible pole perpendicular to the solar plane. It's similar to how a gyroscope rotates about a point near its base as its spinning.

If you wanted to have what you described where the North has a permanent summer and the south had a permanent winter, you'd have to have the axial precession of your planet match up with the revolution about the star it's orbiting around, with the Northern hemisphere always facing in the general direction of the star. That way, the Northern hemisphere is always being lit by the sun in greater proportion than the south, there is a portion of the north that is always bathed in sunlight, and there is a bit of the south permanently shrouded in darkness. This is highly unlikely in practice as precession is usually extremely slow relative to orbital time for bodies as massive as the Earth, but that's the only way I'd think would work. You can think of this as the axis of the planet tracing out a conical sort of shape about the star as it orbits over the year.

7089,"I hadn't even considered the idea of a non-circular orbit. I'll have to do some reading to find out how those might work. Thank you for that suggestion!

I did mention a change in axial tilt in prior conversations, a ""wobble"" that might affect seasons. I was told it either didn't happen in nature or that it was incredibly uncommon, but I don't know enough about it to be sure. I had read earlier that it was what explained the inconsistent seasonal length in the Game of Thrones world, so it's interesting that you brought that up.

I realize in a fantasy setting I can really get away with whatever, but I do like to have one foot in reality. I find that players and readers enjoy knowing that there are rules, and that the rules make sense and are consistent. Part of that, to me, is making sure the basic physics of a planet make sense. And usually it's really easy to just emulate the standard orbit of the Earth, but for this particular setting I had other ideas in mind.

I do appreciate your suggestions, though, and I'm continuing reading on the topic. If someone does step up and really explains it out for me, great, but in the meantime it's my responsibility to make an effort to understand the material on my own. Even if I really don't have the mathematical foundation I should for this kind of reading.",1590985444,astrophysics,OptimalRedbeard,Astrophysics,Comment,242
7090,"I'm not educated in the field at all, besides a little physics and astronomy education, so hopefully someone more knowledgeable will be along to help, but here are my thoughts

The seasons on earth are caused by our axial tilt. Because the earth leans a little to one side, each hemisphere receives more sunlight than the other for part of the year. You can see a good visual diagram [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/y45HnNwKShKuUFZn7)

Now, let's say that, unlike earth, the axis of your planet turned throughout its orbit so that the North Pole always leaned towards the sun. I know planets axial tilts can change, but I don't know if there would be any precedent for this. Either way, this would make it so the Northern Hemisphere experiences eternal summer, and the South eternal winter. 

Now lets say that instead of having a (mostly) circular orbit like Earth, your planet had a slightly teardrop-shapes orbit, bringing it closer and farther from the sun over the course of the year, with the north pole always leaning towards the sun. This would give your planet seasonal temperature fluctuation, with the North always being relatively warmer than the South. This would also give your north pole a never-ending day, and your south pole eternal night.

Again, I don't know if any of this is truly feasible, but the important thing to remember is that this is a fictional world. It doesn't have to follow the rules of our universe! Just look at the world of Game of Thrones, its seasons are total nonsense, but it's still a compelling work of fiction.

Same goes for any center of gravity, like Earth or the Sun, though the time dilation isn't as severe as it is at a black hole.

So, if you were falling into a black hole, from your perspective you would age at the same rate but the universe outside the black hole would age very rapidly. In fact, you would see the life of the universe go by in a very short period. If you were outside the black hole watching someone fall in, you would see that person slow down and eventually stop moving, then redshift and disappear.

Obviously the ideal would be to do neither, and simulate the whole region to get better statistics (one could imagine having multiple ""observers"" at different positions, and calculating lightcones for each). But this would require either allocating more computational resources, or reducing the simulation's resolution. The former isn't always possible, and the latter can compromise accuracy. So the paper's method seems like a good compromise.

The important question to answer with any optimisation like this is whether it affects the results in a statistical sense, which is what we're generally interested in with simulations.

1) For the last time, stop these dishonest and tedious attempts at undermining the criticism you got here regarding an **undergraduate** topic (not current research, not open questions in physics).

2) Stop mentioning philosophy here. It's an excuse / diversion and not what's making your posts wrong. A future reader of this conversation might be mislead to think this is a matter of philosophy, personal preference or even opinion when it isn't. As I said in another post, you're being like the guy trying to calculate photon momentum by performing some limit on mv/√[1-v²/c²].

&gt;what's your stance concerning photon proper time is, except that you state that it's undefinable, and leave it at that: you don't think about it further than that.

""Not well-defined"" is a pretty clear stance. It means it can't be given a sensible definition. This isn't anything odd or unsatisfying within math or science and it doesn't signify a lack of understanding or engagement with a situation, the contrary it signifies a more detailed understanding of the geometry of spacetime. It isn't subject to change, much like north of the north pole isn't going to become a meaningful directive.

Black holes (objects with horizons) exist, regardless of singularities. The horizon is not critical or singular. It's a major problem for the predictiveness of the theory however that for things falling in you get geodesic incompleteness though (""wordlines end after finite time in a singularity""). This doesn't come down to an undergrad performing random algebra where / thoughtlessly applying results ignoring any kind of context followed by spreading baseless fairytales about the meaning of the result he got from that process.

It isn't a good look to be doubling down endlessly afterwards, when as someone who has supposedly passed an SR exam at some point you can't remember anything to make a rigorous argument and your only strategy is to undermine factual arguments with one unfitting analogy after another, among other things invoking quantum mechanics to try and portray this as a matter of ""interpretation"", before ultimately saying ""we don't know shit"" (about an.... undergrad topic..). Arguing with false analogies is a logical fallacy, not physics. This is dishonest and not reputable.

You still try to remove all of this from philosophy, which with a couple other clues somehow is telling me that we may have a significant age difference; many if not most of my instrumentalist colleagues have become more interested in the philosophy of physics over time, and realism especially, is what I've observed.

That's not expansion, that's just the fact that light has a finite velocity of propagation.

&gt;I've also heard mention that due to our expansion, matter is becoming further and further apart.

Yes, the distances between objects that are very far away from each other (cosmological scale) are increasing. That is expansion.

&gt; is there a central point where the expansion is originating?

There is no central point. This expansion looks the same everywhere and in every direction. Distances between far away objects are increasing. The faster the further away they are.

&gt;Related would be that our universe is expanding faster as time goes on. Is this true? 

Yes, the rate at which it expands keeps increasing with time.

&gt;Wouldn't it be ""expanding"" at the speed of light?

Expansion doesn't have a speed. It has a rate. It makes no sense to compare to the speed of light. Objects that are very distance can appear to be receding from each other at velocities faster than light. But these velocities don't mean much in general relativity / curved spacetime. Only local velocities (between objects close to each other) mean something and can't exceed c.

A final technical note: it is not quite true that expansion occurs everywhere. When averaged over very large scales, it's a very good approximation, but on smaller scales there is a lot of variation because the local density of matter affects the expansion rate.

This is closer to the right idea. Space itself is actually expanding. There is more space now than there was a second ago, and there will be more space a second from now than there is at this moment. The net result is that everything seems to be getting farther and farther apart, because there amount of space between objects increases as time passes. It's happening everywhere. There is no center point.

&gt;Related would be that our universe is expanding faster as time goes on. Is this true?

Yes, as best as we can tell. The best way to think of it is by imagining two random points some great distance apart. If you measure the distance between them now, and then come back say, a billion years later, the distance between them might be 1.25 times the original distance. If you come back a billion years after that, the distance between them might be 1.3 times what it was the second time you measured. Those numbers are made up, but hopefully it gets the idea across.

&gt;I'm fairly unknowledgeable when it comes to what we know about the universe

7270,"Glad you like it :) Yeah, this project could 'spiral' out of control time-wise (pun intended!). But there are ways to manage it by choosing which tasks to tackle. Here is how I see the difficulty level:

**High school level**: Collect the empirical data (photos of the moon) and calculate the rotation speed such that one side always faces Earth. I think the math here would take a good high school student &lt;1hr. Probably too easy for what you're thinking, but a good start.

**Physics major undergrad level (sophomore - junior)**: 

\- Work out whether or not the collision-model would always produce a moon with a spin equal and opposite to the orbit such that only one face sees the planet. This requires correct application of conservation of angular momentum, &amp; I'd bet conservation of energy and conservation of (linear) momentum are likely required as well. It'll probably take a number of false-starts before landing on a good approach. I'd expect this might take a physics undergrad a day or two to work out and feel confident - which seems about right for a good science fair project. After building a good analytical model you could also generate a few plots to illustrate the outcomes of your model. This would likely be the 'meat' of the project.

\- I'd also lump the questions of precession and whether or not the 'dark side' of the moon might eventually face Earth into this undergrad bucket. I view them more as tangential side-questions though.

**Late Physics Undgrad or grad school level**: Computer simulations of collisions under various initial conditions. This seems appropriate for late undergrad or grad school, and I'd expect it to take the better part of one or two days to code it up.

*Full disclosure*: I've never actually worked out the math on this myself, so I can't guarantee that there is a neat pen-&amp;-paper analytical solution here to find. But I don't think that should discourage you. When doing 'real world' science there's never a textbook to compare your results against. You just do the best you can and then use your results to argue for or against various ideas. In the case of this project, your analytical model might turn out to be incorrect - and so you might go on to to support a disproven model or attack an established one. But that's OK! In fact, that would be an ideal outcome for a science fair project in my opinion!

You could take photos of the moon across many days/nights to show that the same side always faces Earth. Then, you can calculate what its rotation speed must be to offset its orbital speed in this way. Moons can be formed in a number of ways: (1) formed along with the planet in the baby solar system, (2) passing debris caught in the planet's gravity, or (3) formed as a result of a collision between a large object and Earth. Work out whether or not the collision-model would always produce a moon with a spin equal and opposite to the orbit such that only one face sees the planet. If so, that would be huge evidence in support of the collision model. Are your findings in support of, contrary to, or neutral to the collision-formation model?

The math/physics concepts here would be: conservation of momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and gravitation and stable orbits.

Some other directions to go:
- Can you measure precession in the moon's spin? Does that provide any insight into how it was formed?
- Are there theoretical grounds that if you waited long enough the other side of the moon would eventually face Earth? If so, work out how long you would have to wait.
- If you have some coding skills the collision- formation event could be modeled in the computer (i.e. Python). Aside from producing some cool and dramatic movies, simulations under a number of different initial conditions could provide evidence for or against the collision-formation model.",1590325487,astrophysics,landonprisbrey,Astrophysics,Comment,263

If you make it more of a continuous fluid rather than solid particles you may end up with something more galaxy shaped. You could start with different amounts of angular momentum / potential energy and see the effect this has on the structures that form. Even just producing numbers without a graphical output can be a satisfying investigation.

All you'd have to do for this example is produce a force on the particles that acts like Newton's Law of Gravitation. Then update their coordinates accordingly with each timestep.

7309,"We're not exactly sure why they have them or what the conditions are for their formation. It's most likely a combination of the core's spin and strong magnetic fields in the inner region. Like how the Earth's magnetic fields channel charged particles into the polar regions to create aurorae, the magnetic fields around these objects can channel large amounts of charged material (plasma) away from an accretion disk that's orbiting the same object. So the material doesn't come *from* the black hole or protostar, it's from a separate source and being accelerated up and over the black hole/protostar. 

The presence of these magnetic fields isn't surprising.

7337,"Regarding density of stars and the known object we usually measure them using their apparent brightness(which lies in the visible spectrum) and Wien’s displacement law. Therefore, what we measure is not its true density.

So one of the reasons why we might not be able to measure the density of a black hole is due it’s ability to emit no visible light(This is assuming the displacement law only works in the visible spectrum range).

Regarding infinite density; is just a theory for something unexplainable really. 

For example another question that is unexplainable is why doesn’t a black hole collapse into something else? Since a star’s gravity overpowering it’s nuclear force causes it to collapse and form a black hole, why doesn’t a black hole, with gravity sting enough to trap light, not collapse the force present in the ‘singularity’?

In short the answer to that question would be simply infinite density. It is infinite and thus you must need infinite gravitational force to collapse.(which won’t happen, but that’s a discussion for another time.

7343,"These aren't really 3 or 4 options. Given the evidence the universe is in fact expanding at an accelerating rate, will keep expanding forever and result in heat death. Dark energy is dominating. Until further notice (as you suggest things would suddenly have to change for that to change.)

Dominating dark energy doesn't however lead to a big rip. The big rip requires a more violent form of dark energy usually called phantom energy that grows stronger with time. Dark energy doesn't affect bound systems so it doesn't rip apart galaxies (or black holes).

&gt;what happens to the Black Hole? It would take quite a long time for the Dark Energy to have any noticeable effect on it

I'm just going to assume you meant phantom energy for the rest of the comment. This paper is addressing what would happen to black holes in a universe with phantom energy: [The fate of black holes in an accelerating universe](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269304005143). Not an expert on what happens in detail here. Generally as you start to consider very small mass black holes, quantum gravitational effects become important and we lack physics to make statements about this.

&gt;Do we get another Big Bang (or something along those lines) as the [~~Dark~~ Phantom] Energy starts to rip the singularity apart? 

I don't know why people often jump to the conclusion that something would lead to another big bang when it's not clear to me how that situation resembles the early universe in any way. Maybe the idea of having the same process repeat itself is cool to some people. Don't know. You merely assert there are similarities when they don't seem to be any

&gt;I ask because I just can't help but draw similarities between the Big Bang and this hypothetical scenario.

Smaller notes

&gt;Entropy takes over the universe, and everything slowly dies with a whimper. The last flashes of light that the universe would see would be the death of black holes as they slowly evaporate from Hawking Radiation.

Entropy isn't something that can ""take over"". It's a quantity, a number that you can calculate for a system like energy or pressure.

&gt;It slowly grows more and more disperse as Dark Energy starts to rip stars out of the gravitational influence of the now combined Supermassive Black holes, until even that is left all alone in a pitch black environment.

Galaxies like the Milky way aren't in any way dominated by the gravity of the central supermassive black hole. You could take that black hole (2.6 million solar masses) out and the galaxy (1.5 trillion solar masses) would show only negligibly different gravitational behaviour. The black hole is a very small part of the total mass of the galaxy, a billionth of the total mass (~2 million times 1 billion = ~2 trillion). A galaxy is orbiting ""itself"" (ie the centre of gravity of all the other masses in the galaxy), not the central black hole of negligible mass (0.0000001% of the mass of the galaxy). This is unlike the solar system where the central body makes up 99.9% of the total mass of the system.


&gt;Is The Big Bang Theory 100% correct?

It's mainly correct. The universe started out hot and dense and expanded and cooled. This is supported by evidence. Though questions like inflation remain open, so it's not ""finished"".",1590060190,astrophysics,lettuce_field_theory,Astrophysics,Comment,557

7351,"So a lot of this is wrong, while the comment is heavily upvoted.

&gt;As you approach the event horizon, gravity exponentially gets stronger.

It does not get *exponentially* stronger. Exponential means it's an exponential function (where the variable is in the exponent 2^x for instance). An n'th power like 1/r² is not exponential.

Secondly it's worth pointing out that OP seems to be talking about the waterfall model of a black hole. You can rewrite the metric of a black hole in terms of a velocity that's similar to a waterfall.

https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/waterfall.html

&gt;You can accelerate an object to 98% the speed of light, but at that point, the mass of the object begins to increase because of the energy stored in the object. Einstein introduced E=MC² to show that mass and energy are interchangeable in formulas, and are the same thing, just in two different states. 

It's not true that the mass increases with velocity. The mass stays the same. The concept of relativistic mass is disfavoured in physics. Relativistic mass is only a misnomer for total energy and doesn't act like the mass of an object. It's not the right thing to look at.

It's not correct that E = mc² (correct way to write it) means that mass and energy are interchangeable. It means a massive object at rest has energy equal to its mass. The mass of an object contributes to the total energy. The generic expression for the total energy E is E = √[(mc²)² + (pc)²] (rest means p = 0 and you get the first formula). It's not true that all energy is mass in some way and while  mass is only a specific part of the total energy (the part present in the rest frame of the object).

&gt;So as you continue to add energy, you are also adding mass, requiring even more energy to accelerate, making the object heavier. Because you need an infinite amount of energy to travel the speed of light, you would then have infinite mass. 

It is still true that if you calculate the energy it takes to accelerate an object close to c the figure grows without bound (for c it's infinity).",1590058432,astrophysics,lettuce_field_theory,Astrophysics,Comment,365

I majored in physics at a community college and transferred to UC Davis a year ago as a physics major with an emphasis in astrophysics.

1. Choose your school wisely. If you get accepted into multiple universities, read up on what type of research, if any, is done by the faculty. Make sure they have something that you are truly interested in. I very much enjoy UC Davis, but I do wish I would have picked another university that had accepted me, based on the research they do. I just didn't give them a long enough look before I made my decision.

2. Visit the campuses if possible. Talk to students in the department, and talk to the faculty. The main reason I picked Davis was because I knocked on a professors door and she stopped everything she was doing to answer my questions for an hour! Faculty at another university I was accepted into didn't want to give me the time of day.

3. PRACTICE MATH!!! oh, and PRACTICE MATH. No matter how good you think you are at math, you are not good enough. Focus on Differential Equations.

Therefore falling towards earth you are not changing your position in space as you are falling with it. Now when you hit the earth and stay on the surface you experience force (g-force) as the surface is pushing you away from the falling space therefore you are essentially changing your position in space. 

Back to the blackhole example: if you had a solid core then you falling with space is fine even if its faster than light but hitting a surface that can stop your atoms from falling with space means you are now essentially moving through space faster than light which is not possible.

Hyperspace is the space between universes that universes grow into. It's 11 dimensional and may contain even more folded dimensions. This is our household theory of how something came from nothing. 

The square Cube Law states that if you double the height of something and keep it's proportions the same, it's volume is cubed.

So if I have a 10ftx10ftx10ft square, it has 1,000 ft³

But if I double it, to 20ftx20ftx20ft, I get 8,000 ft³

I multiplied one of the lengths (let's say height) by 2, and kept the proportions the same. In turn, the volume of said square increased by 2x2x2, or 2³.

This is a problem when trying to create Godzilla sized monsters. The strength needed to suddenly support x³ times the weight you were used to just isn't there.

I promise I'm not just spewing bs. I've studied theories for about 8 years now, but it has been off and on, never in a concentrated amount. I've always been fascinated with the universe and it's inner workings. 

What I have come to trust as the truth at this moment, is that 11 dimensional hyperspace exists without a beginning or end, and our universe is one of many bubbles that form inside it. Our universe expanded, and the vacuum that existed created matter and antimatter, which collides and leaves a miniscule amount of matter, but a large amount of photons. I've never even heard of blackbody photons until you commented, so I searched some stuff up real quick. Feel free to keep correcting me, I obviously need it.

I know an antimass particle would act strangely to forces applied to it. Gravity would repel such particles, and if you pushed it in a certain vector, it would go in the opposite direction. I also believe if we were to somehow create an anti-higgs field, we could move a mountain with no physical effort.

Einstein introduced E=MC² to show that mass and energy are interchangeable in formulas, and are the same thing, just in two different states.

7411,"I agree with the previous suggestions and will also add the you should spend your time over the summer getting some certifications. Like maybe a certification in Python, C, C#, C++, and/or Linux. I would also suggest trying to fully learn and/or get a certification if you can find one in IDL. I'm an undergraduate in astrophysics and I use IDL constantly for one of my research teams. It's generally used by astrophysicists. 

If you can show that you have skills in these (and/or other) programming languages, then you'll be a lot more desirable as a graduate student, even if you don't have research experience. 

I might even suggest trying to find a course on spectroscopy, data reduction and rectification processes and data analysis because that's what a lot of astrophysics research entails. Even if you can't get certified or show any type of course completion, you'll at least be able to say you can complete that type of work and are proficient in it. 

Another option is to begin taking classes at a university as a non-degree seeking student and sometimes the school will then take you on as a degree-seeking student (likely in a Master's at first). The benefit of this is that you can select courses that will make you desirable to graduate school and have the possibility of being taken on by that school as well. 

I know your situation is tough because you didn't have opportunities others of us had but some element of it really is putting yourself out there. I have been on 3 research teams as a junior in college. The first was a year long, the second I am 6 months into and plan to continue with until I graduated and the 3rd I will be starting in the fall and plan to continue until I graduate.. but in each one of the circumstances, I got the positions because I put myself out there. I didn't even know if these teams had spaces at all, much less for undergrads. All I did was do a lot of research on professors and find ones who shared my interests and then emailed and/or talked with them in person about possibly research opportunities. One of them actually created a position for me because of my enthusiasm and willingness to learn so I'm the only undergrad on the team and apparently the first undergrad in many years. 

My point with that is that you really have to be willing to put the work in and put yourself out there as being open to any opportunities, almost certainly starting out unpaid and not for college credit but for the experience itself. And it definitely doesn't have to be at your University at all. It can be anywhere. 

I also highly recommend applying the the NASA L'Space Academy Programs. It is not very competitive to get into, and you really learn a lot and while it's geared more towards engineering, you will still love it. Plus itll look great on your resume! 

Sorry to write a book like I just did but I wanted to give you all of the advice I have! Just don't give up. Make a long list of people who share your research interests and send emails describing your situation and skills and ask about possible opportunities to gain some experience.

I don't know if you know this, but to put some rough numbers on it, grad schools are getting 200+ applications to fill an incoming class of \~5 students.

7428,"&gt;Carl Sagan said there are at least eleven dimensions

He didn't say any of that and has been dead for almost 25 years. Regardless what he did or didn't say, discussing physics isn't done by quoting random things any (particularly deceased) scientist has casually said at some point and making an appeal to authority; it's done through scientific papers, mathematical models, experiments, evidence.

Even if string theory suggests more than the 3+1 dimensions we have evidence for, it has nothing to do with dark matter ""hiding in extra dimensions"", if we do know that dark matter is just (otherwise ordinary) particles of unknown type. Think neutrinos as an example (which contribute to dark matter, as they only intereact gravitationally and through the weak interaction, but can't make up all of it).

&gt;While string theory says that there are extra dimension that are so tiny that only the tiniest particles can enter them. 

This isn't really accurate either. It rather says you would need extremely high energies to probe any extra dimensions if they are there. They don't show up at lower energies so we have rough constraints on the size of such extra dimensions. Particles are pointlike and don't have a size. The size of these dimensions has nothing to do with fitting small particles into it, so the argument isn't sound. It has to do with how much energy it takes to generate an excitation in these degrees of freedom.

Using the word ""subatomic"" is also slightly questionable. We do know dark matter isn't atoms (which are bound systems of charged, electromagnetically interacting particles). We also do know how it behaves, it interacts gravitationally, just like all other matter, while lacking electromagnetic interactions (so a lot of features like clumping into smaller structures isn't there). We see how it behaves in the evolution of the universe, etc.

You might ask why your (vague) suggestion (""What if these extra dimensions and dark matter are related in any way?"") is so ""quickly dismissed"" but it's basically because there's no basis for this suggestion and we know enough about it to realize that quickly.

Taking you up on your final remark, it's you who's quickly dismissing informed answers here. Maybe you should do some reading on what we do know about dark matter, before lecturing people that we don't know anything about it (especially while seemingly confusing dark matter with dark energy). I've posted some resources for this, so have fun reading.

7434,"Thanks for sharing this! It's amazing to see how the Hubble tension is becoming a real thing. However, the headline and the article itself is a bit misleading. According to the original source in [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org), the problem is that different methods of of measuring the Hubble constant yield different results. In particular, measurements using the CMB yield a result of around 67 km/s/Mps, while the ""ladder method"" that uses cosmological candles results in 74 km/s/Mps. This is known as the Hubble tension, and has already been a thing during the last decade, but it was assumed that the discrepancy arises from unknown systematical errors in the second method (for instance, inaccurate modelling of Type Ia supernovae or of the period-luminosity relationship in Cepheid stars could significantly change the results). However, this study performs the most well calibrated measurement of the Hubble constant up to date using the ladder method, and the results disagree with the Hubble tension being an experimental fluke.

These are amazing news, because it means that we could be missing a matter/energy component in the universe, or some kind of interaction between the currently known ones. And yes, if new matter/energy components or interactions are added to the universe, it COULD lead to new value for the computed of the age of the universe. This, together with the anisotropic expansion of the universe seen in different wavelengths, could really open the door to new physics.

7439,"When a rocket launches, it starts off going straight up, away from the Earth's surface. After a while, it starts tilting sideways, to gain speed parallel to the Earth's surface, in order to get into orbit. The aim of doing this is not to avoid falling - when something's orbiting, it's constantly falling. However, because it has gained some momentum parallel to the Earth's surface, it doesn't just fall straight down - it travels forward as it falls, with a curved trajectory. If, by the time it's stopped burning, it's going fast enough, then because the Earth's surface is curved, the curved trajectory of the satellite will match the curvature of the Earth, and it will keep on falling ""around"" the Earth - it will be in orbit. If it's reached a sufficient speed to do this, and if it's sufficiently high up that air resistance is negligible, it now doesn't have to do anything - it will keep on going at its speed, constantly falling around the Earth, in orbit.  


What this comes down to is momentum conservation. If something's moving with constant velocity, you can't make the object slow down or speed up by applying a force perpendicular to the body - the force has to have some component parallel to the velocity for this to happen. However, what does happen is that it changes the direction of the velocity - if the force is constant, resulting in circular motion. Specifically, when a body has some rotational motion, we say that it has angular momentum, which is conserved in a closed system (i.e. where we just have the orbiting body and the central force).",1589759242,astrophysics,colonelkusak,Astrophysics,Comment,276

7441,"You can think of orbits (very basically) as swinging a weight on a string in a circle over your head. The tension on the string is always pulling straight inwards - just like gravity - but the tangential velocity of the weight means that circular motion can be established. There’s no force inhibiting that motion, so, by Newton’s First Law, it will keep moving. In the infinitesimal limit, you can think of it as a triangle. The gravity pulls it in - decreasing the distance to the body - but its motion moves it over, which increase the distance to the body. When things are properly situated, these effects balance, and the acceleration due to gravity therefore doesn’t change the magnitude of the velocity, just its direction. This is just for perfectly circular motion. You can have elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic orbits as well, in which case the magnitude of the velocity increases as the body approaches whatever it is orbiting, but the principle is the same. 

We are indeed polluting with rocket fuel. The concentrations are negligible though. What you have to worry about is the rocket fuel that we burn getting out of the atmosphere.

I took classes like Stars, Galaxies and Cosmology, and Stellar Astrophysics instead of classes like Nuclear and Particle Physics or a more general Optics course (I had one focused on telescopes and observatories in general - including orbital telescopes and detection methods used for light outside the visual range).

I do agree that a planetary science degree sounds like its going to involve a lot of geology/geophysics. You may want to look at the degree plans for all of the degrees to help make your call. It also depends on your interests. Planetary science is a branch of the larger astrophysics field, so it gives you a focus for study and may help direct you toward specific graduate programs to complete your studies. If that degree plan also includes astronomical topics covering stars, cosomology, and observational methods, it may be a good route.

That said, in a lot of Physics degree programs in a department that includes an astronomy program, you could just opt to take Astro classes for your electives and get your early astro exposure that way. It is not at all uncommon for people to enter into astronomy graduate programs with very little astro background because a lot of schools will only offer physics and not astro at the undergrad level. By this I mean going with a physics degree won't necessarily lock you out of astronomy for graduate school. You might even (as two of my 6 classmates did) discover you enjoy some other area of physics more - they ended up going into particle physics instead of astro.

Based on your options, I would suggest Astronomy as this major, from what I have come across, has some elements of astrophysics in there(I’m presuming you have read the course description of both the majors). Plus, I think there is a higher chance of research relation you can build going through this major.(this point can be invalid if you personally make more connections even with a diff major)

I would suggest you do pick up physics as a minor or few physics courses as electives(if your uni allows it) as they really help in few astrophysics courses. Even learning python can help with prediction models in astrophysics.

Now, If your astronomy course does not have any elements of astrophysics, and your physics course does, then I suggest you take physics as a major and vice versa. This will help you build an even stronger base in astrophysics.(This option would be quite similar to what I am going through). 

Finally it’s up to you. These were simply my opinions, but give the course description a good read again and see which one is more beneficial. Also,  read as many comments as you’ll have more variety and reasons to pick a major.

No; as the black holes approach each other, the event horizons become distorted. I don't know the details here - and I suspect they have to be simulated since the geometry is messy - but it's feasible that you can have multiple concentric event horizons, as rotating black holes do.

&gt; Is the surface area or volume of that event horizon conserved in someway?

Generally, no. The radius of a black hole's event horizon is proportional to its mass, so during a merger of two equal-mass black holes, the total event horizon surface area doubles, and its volume increases by a factor of four.",1589031661,astrophysics,xilefakamot,Astrophysics,Comment,115

7626,"If you're already proficient with your IDL, you can probably avoid a class that's aimed at complete beginners. I'd look for a class along the lines of ""python for scientists"" as they tend to assume you're more familiar with the fundamentals of programming.

The content of this sort of course will also be more appropriate. Knowing about packages like NumPy and matplotlib will be more immediately useful to you than sysadmin or web development, which is where more generally focused python courses tend to end up.

Or, just have a go at starting using Python! I started my PhD having never done any python, and while I'm still learning even now, it only took me six weeks or so to get going.

As far as other languages go your choices are C, C++ and Fortran. It'd be worth doing some research into the codes that are used in your field to decide which is most relevant.  
* Fortran is probably the easiest to pick up (as both IDL and parts of NumPy use Fortran code under the hood so there are similarities in design).
* C is a simpler language, but demands a lot more knowledge about the inner workings of the computer as a result - things like memory management that other languages handle for you remain your responsibility in C.
* C++ has a lot of extra language features and library code that together address this somewhat, but as a result the language is much more complex and difficult to learn.

Unless you want to do computationally focused research (i.e.  actually working on developing these codes to add new physics processes etc.) it's probably not necessary to really 'learn' these lower level languages, but a degree of familiarity would still be useful.",1588750229,astrophysics,nivlark,Astrophysics,Comment,294

If humans could travel faster than the speed of light, they would go back in time, but they could only go back as far as there is ordinary matter. Before that the universe went through several phase changes with different forces and particles. The universe started in a hot dense state like a plasma. You couldn't live there.  

The Big Bang theory describes the expansion of the universe, not the creation. We know nothing about creation, or if it has a beginning. The universe is still expanding everywhere. So you can see it now. You can observe the Big Bang, the expansion, now.   

It's not known if the universe is finite or infinite. There are good reasons to believe either. But, if the universe is infinite, it started out as infinite and has no edges.  Even if the universe is finite, it still has no edges. There's a long explanation behind that I won't type up here.

I mean, these are nothing but matters of definition, so the questions and answers don't really mean as much as perhaps you think ...

Cosmology can help respond to your question, but I’m afraid the answers aren’t very meaningful.

1) you ask about the time before the Big Bang, but unfortunately that question is impossible to answer. We say time started at the Big Bang, and any attempts to say what happened at that instant or before it aren’t grounded in physics. There’s simply no way to know.

2) you ask about the edge of the universe. Some people have taken that as the edge of the observable universe, but that’s something different. There’s an edge to what we can see, but that’s just because light takes time to travel. If you could jump to the furthest observable galaxy right now, it would look pretty similar to what we see from Earth. There’s no reason to think space has an edge, it could be infinite in extent or shaped such that there’s no edge. That answer is about as uninspiring as the last one, but unfortunately these big questions are almost impossible to answer or even meaningfully guess at with our current knowledge. What I want to emphasize here is that the edge of the observable universe is *not* the edge of space, and that there is absolutely stuff beyond that limit that we just can’t see from where we are now.",1588656072,astrophysics,_MagnumDong,Astrophysics,Comment,260

Then you fire beams of light into the structure and as it passes through the ergosphere (it’s above the event horizon and it warps space time in a way that any light passing through it will gain energy). As the light bounces around in the farm it will gain energy and the spinning black hole will slowly lose angular momentum over time (it will take more years to stop it from spinning than I care to name). Then you can harvest the much mire energetic light to produce energy. Another hypothetical technology which’s name escapes me, can push hydrogen from the surface of a star back into its center (heavier atoms like to sink to the core and lighter atoms float) which can prolong stellar life for at least double the original life).

7680,"The event horizon of a black hole is an area around the black hole where its gravity is so strong that it exceeds the speed of light. Regardless of the overall mass of the black hole, even light cannot escape past the area beyond a black hole's event horizon. Once you cross this boundary, every single world line leads directly to the singularity. 

To an observer in a spaceship watching you fall into a black hole, the observer would see you approach the event horizon, but because the gravitational field exceeds that of the speed of light, the observer would never see you actually cross the event horizon. From their perspective, you would appear to take an infinitely long time (that is the time dilation) and they simply would see an image of you near the boundary (the event horizon) slowly get dimmer and dimmer (red-shift).

From the perspective of the astronaut (you), your clock would tick normally and you would experience time as you would normally. If the black hole was sufficiently large enough, it could be possible for you to actually cross the event horizon of the black hole before being ripped apart by extreme gravitational forces. Once you floated beyond the event horizon, however, you would not be able to look back and see your friend in the spaceship. No matter which way you looked, all you would see is the singularity.

Since lenght doesn't matter blackholes have a very strong and insane gravitational field. You see the milky way and everygalaxy ? They are all supposed to have a black hole at their centers arround which revolves everything that composes the galaxy.

7689,"The two main uses of code in astrophysics are simulations and data analysis.

Simulations involve things like simulating galaxy formation and evolution, or impacts of celestial bodies.

Data analysis can be things like taking the spectra of stars over time and analysing how redshifted they are and then getting their recessional velocity over time to determine any wobble caused by any large planets orbiting it. Or image analysis, picking out various sources within an image and analysing their positions, intensities, colours etc. Or analysing data on solar neutrinos to determine their oscillation and get mass limits and things like that. Everything in astrophysics involves lots of data, so it all needs to be analysed using code. 

There's lots of libraries that have been written to do all the heavy lifting for you. Python is the new favourite and has great libraries like numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, astropy etc.

2. Solve quadratic equations (the user would choose the coefficients).
3. Take data from a file (in our case it was radioactive decay data which contained the count number and the time taken) and plot a graph of it.

There was also an optional course which some of my friends took, and they were creating models of the solar system, which involved object oriented programming. I didn’t get to take this course but I wish I had, it just means I’ll be learning this stuff in the computing course next year.

But even if you don't get into a ""good"" college that doesn't mean anything at all.

Programming is a crucial tool not only in computer science of course but in astrophysics too! I'd suggest to start with Python since is a common language among many scientific fields in order to learn the basics of the language and of programming in general.

In my opinion it's best to learn a programming language by solving your own problems. Let's say you want to make a simple plot for one of your excercises or solve a linear or non-linear equation. If you know the mathematical method that is required to solve your equation or the method in general you need to solve any kind of problem, then start writing a program gradually implementing the logical steps of the solution.

In a few words if you know the method then the programming part is simply the syntax of the language you want to use. e.g How to define my variables, the types of my variables (integer, real, etc.), how can i plot an (x,y) plot. So start writing a program in Python and at the same time googling these basic ideas about how to implement them and you will start learn fast and gradually the next problem will lead you to another one and soon you will have covered enough ground.

I recommend these references to start learning about Python which you should use interchangeable:

7710,"I think you are a little confused. You talk about wanting to do research, but also about working for NASA, when the two are largely different career paths.

NASA's primary focus is the design and operation of spacecraft, not the science that's done with them (Note that there are some exceptions such as [STSci](https://www.stsci.edu/), but for the most part this is true). Instead, research is done by academic staff - PhD students, post-docs, and professors - who are employed by universities around the world. The majority also are involved with undergraduate teaching.

There's no such thing as ""research companies"", although research in some areas e.g. telescope instrumentation, does sometimes lead to a ""spin-out"" company that makes a commercial product based on the research.

Salaries in research are generally comfortable, but they are far below potential earnings in other fields. I would say that if income is your primary motivation you don't really have the right mindset for research. Most people do research because it's their passion, not because they see it as a way to become rich.

Go to the developer mode on the page you like, find a function that's either called update() or propagate() (variations ...) or just try to read through the code until you find what the links and u/nivlark's explanations speak of.  Specifically, find a line that looks a lot like this, 

Vec3d new\_pos = pos + vel\*dt + acc\*(dt\*dt\*0.5);

and add

console.log(""xpos = "" + new\_pos.x);

Even if you get perfect grades in every class, go into the best PhD program, publish the most papers, win the most awards... there may be no jobs in your specific area open when you need to apply. *Or*, there are jobs but they decided who they were going to hire before they put the ad out, and it isn't you, it's their buddy.

And in the adult world, you can't just sit around for 12 months waiting for the next hiring round (jobs are posted ~once per year) because you have bills to pay *today*. So you get a job in a different industry because you need to eat to survive... and then you're out of the race. It's nigh impossible to get back into academia once you've spent time away after your PhD because the fields move fast and your knowledge is quickly outdated. Maybe you could do 1 year, but after 2 years...

That's the big problem for a lot of people: it has to be a straight shot through and if it doesn't work out the first time, or if the timelines don't match up, you're out.

Most people do also recognise that academia is just pure shit and they choose to go into industry at the end of their PhD. It seems like most people who have a burning passion for astro will end up hating academia and want nothing to do with it. You'll probably want to leave too. When you're older, the constant uprooting, moving country, losing assets, having no permanent home, putting off having a family, putting off having *a life*... it gets old fast.

7818,"You might struggle to get many answers given that I expect many users are US based, where it is common to switch majors. In the UK, I don't think it's impossible to switch courses, but I'm sure it is not as easy, and it may set you back a year (it's a long time since I left, so things may have changed). My recommendation would be to contact astronomers in the physics (or astronomy) department of the university you were accepted to and inquire about the possibility of switching. Without their support, I imagine it would be very hard. 

Again, take this with a grain of salt, but I don't think it would be impossible to get into an astrophysics masters program with a CompSci BSc, but it would probably be difficult. You should contact every place that you might want to go before assuming this is a possibility to confirm - eventually your CompSci skills would be a huge asset, but there is a lot of physics and astronomy theory that you would be lacking and this would make departments reluctant to take a chance on you.

Basically, in all cases I would recommend talking to people who are likely to be the gate keepers for advice, being open and honest about the challenges you have faced, the institutional barriers you've encountered, and what you have achieved. Generally, accommodations for disabilities and mental health are improving in universities, and universities are under some pressure to show that they can indeed be accommodating. Additionally, grit - demonstrated by overcoming challenges - is becoming recognized as a predictor of future success in admissions decisions too, though this isn't universal yet. If the departments you speak to are dismissive, it's likely that they would not be supportive of you when you get there, so I don't think it would help you much to hide your challenges from them. That said, any response you get is likely to be coloured by the individual responding, so getting second and third opinions at any given location will be important. 

Finally, some places might have joint, cross-department degree possibilities - it's a long shot, but worth looking in to.",1588109150,astrophysics,MTPenny,Astrophysics,Comment,363

7825,"&gt;I mean really what does an astrophysicist do?

We mostly sit in our offices and do programming of some kind. Theorists (like myself) do simulations and observers reduce their data and fit models to it. My office is split roughly 50/50 with theory/observation and we all spend the same amount of time in front of a computer. Instrumentalists are more on the side of engineering, and we honestly don't see them that often. In general, we do segregate into subfields so the experience can vary a bit.

&gt;How do you earn your paycheck?

Funding is complicated, and depends a lot on where exactly you are. Even then, different staff members within the same institute can be funded from different sources and that funding can switch during the year, e.g.

 - A direct paycheque from the university or research institute, just like any other salary for any other job. In the US this may only be paid for 9 months of the year with the remaining 3 coming from savings or outside grants. Elsewhere, it is paid for all 12. 

 - Massive grants from research councils that span either a single field/country or which fund many different fields across many different countries. This could be a lump sum to cover ~5 years of research costs, including hiring postdoctoral researchers, lab techs, and students, and the general operational costs like equipment

&gt;Is there any companies that hire astrophysicists

Universities and research institutes hire astrophysicists in their capacity as astrophysicists. Beyond that, it's pretty close to ""no"". People who have been trained as astrophysicists regularly leave the profession (it's the most common choice because it's rarely a choice) and get jobs in outer industries, but these are barely ever related to astro. They're jobs like data analysis, engineering, software, etc: they certainly use the computational and mathematical skills astronomers have, but don't touch on any of the astro-specific knowledge.",1588083828,astrophysics,astro-temp,Astrophysics,Comment,316

In particular, on the side of the planet where the companion body is visible, the gravitational forces acting on the inhabitants from the two planets are gonna cancel out somewhat, and you could end up with some tall lanky guys evolving. On the other side, the gravitational forces are gonna work in the same direction, so the inhabitants will feel a stronger gravitational force, and might end up being shorter and squatter. Just an idea. Elves vs. orcs...?

7906,"&gt;My point is not rigorous, I claim it to be a reasonable extrapolation.  

You've not been able to address any of the obvious challenges to that claim, you're basically dividing by zero, have it pointed out and just ignore it and call it reasonable. 

Based on your statements and inaccurate phrasing in several places I doubt your background in either the required math (if you think that limit makes sense.. ) or special relativity really. I don't think you've studied it too meaningful accuracy and you seem to be operating mostly based on popscience in this regard.

Without any coherent argument at all you're making claims that you will not find in any primary source. Then you're dismissing obvious counter points that are also **consensus** among physicists. Anything you've been subjected to you made no attempt to justify but just tried immediately sweeping it to the side.  My verdict is dunning kruger. 

&gt;As for all the trivialities about (not) boosting from v to c, I think I've neatly summarized my insight into such ""derivations"" (yes, for the third time I guess, I've done them)

When I'm talking about derivations i mean the literal process of taking the principles of relativity and deriving the known results from these principles. ie doing physics. There is no way to do this for the indefensible claims you have made. There is no route to arrive at your claims. 

&gt;The statement about quantum physics not being part of the picture is beyond me.  Don't you have a world-view, just separate theories?

The whole set up is entirely indifferent / agnostic to any distinction between quantum theory and classical physics. It makes no sense bringing this into it as it doesn't make a difference. It's completely orthogonal to it. Furthermore your remark about states in  Hilbert space made no sense either.

Not just does the the classical quantum distinction not play into this at all, even less so does the distinction between interpretations of quantum theory play a role. It makes no sense mentioning any interpretation here at all.

For clarification I'm talking about this...

&gt;I mean our OP says they are an undergrad, I'm not going to derive anything here (they've either seen it or are about to); I'm giving an ELI of a kind, and yes, I'm just describing the results.

1 don't give me the ""i'm simplifying because it's the best thing for OP"". Special relativity requires only basic math and is fully an  undergrad topic.

2 I don't think *you*'ve seen the derivations and should take a look at them. And I don't think you're listening to the arguments.

&gt;if you take it for what it is, respect the empirical evidence and apply the relativistic equations correctly.

You're not applying them correctly.

&gt;""Photon tau=0"" only means that they can, in principle, cross infinity

This doesn't mean anything.

&gt;and that they don't change on the journey (except cosmic redshift yadda ... )

The whole ""they don't change"" is just nonsense. And it leads to confusion among people trying to learn this. I've seen plenty of people ask ""how can photons redshift if they experience no time"". This wrong factoid is confusing them trying to understand redshift. This doesn't have to be.

&gt;pray tell me how it is not a reasonable extrapolation from how tau behaves as v -&gt; c. I really, really, really, honestly don't see it,

Basically because you aren't looking / listening. You got extensive reasoning explaining it and are just insisting you don't see any. 

&gt;your requests for me looking at the equations sort of miss their mark

I want you to look at the **derivations** of the time dilation formula.

&gt;includes the Everettian view of quantum physics

This is entirely irrelevant to special relativity.

&gt;which is pretty much everything the ""photon perspective"" accounts for: one state in the Hilbert space

This is just nonsense really wtf. This has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. Not even in relativistic quantum theory does this make any sense (which just builds on top of special relativity anyway).

&gt;&gt;In the same way that E = mc² doesn't apply to a photon, other formulas don't apply either.

&gt;What? No, but E = p²c² + (mc²)² does, and I don't see which mark this 'analogy' misses even?

E = mc² only applies to a massive particle and requires that the particle have  a rest frame. Plenty of people blindly apply it to photons, for which E = mc² is not valid.

What you are suggesting is just as wrong as that.

&gt;I could say something similar about the ""denialist"" position, which must appear like gate-keeping for the laymen who have understood something kinda deep and interesting, [...]

It's you who makes it appear as gate keeping, because you just discredit comments that are aiming for accuracy to promote own in accurate comment. Calling it gate keeping is like Trump calling things fake news here. It appeals to a lot of people and just serves disinformation.

&gt;If the proper time clearly approaches zero as v -&gt; c, then

It's not correct to do this for a photon because the derivation requires v &lt; c to even arrive at the formula. You need to boost into the rest frame prior. You cannot take the limit of a Lorentz transform for v ⭢ c. It doesn't work. And in the real world it is also clear why: because in all inertial frames (between which Lorentz transforms do the switching) photons move at c, there are no frames where they are at rest. This is reasoning clear in a real world sense here (real world being a term which you use to avoid rigorous mathematical reasoning but either way it is still clear). 

I feel dumb for repeating this just because part of your case has been to ignore and dismiss it in previous comments.

&gt;what in your opinion is the correct answer to ""what a photon would feel"".

Why don't you just read what has already been said (that the concept isn't well-defined)? Why does everything have to be repeated after you've previously refused to acknowledge it in lengthy comments? People aren't here to jump through your hoops.  If I can summarize it in short, however, starting from the principles of special relativity a photon cannot have a rest frame so the insight we get from this is that it doesn't have a perspective to watch physics from. It just makes no sense.

I mean our OP says they are an undergrad, I'm not going to derive anything here (they've either seen it or is about to); I'm giving an ELI of a kind, and yes, I'm just describing the results.  


&gt;it's bad physics, random physics, ""physics"" that down the road when you  actually want to apply to some results leads you to wrong conclusions.

I don't see how, if you take it for what it is, respect the empirical evidence and apply the relativistic equations correctly.  Which is something this ""interpretational issue"" doesn't affect.  ""Photon tau=0"" only means that they can, in principle, cross infinity; and that they don't change on the journey (except cosmic redshift yadda ... ).  Yes, it's ""against the rules"", but pray tell me how it is not a reasonable extrapolation from how tau behaves as v -&gt; c.  I really, really, really, honestly don't see it, and I dare to say I'm farely well equipped with the mathematical side of (especially) SR -- your requests for me looking at the equations sort of miss their mark -- I base my view on what I have been taught, by actual professors, and my own overall understanding of the world (which, perhaps I should say, includes the Everettian view of quantum physics; this is perhaps significant, because I'm used to thinking of instantaneous states, which is pretty much everything the ""photon perspective"" accounts for: one state in the Hilbert space).  Also, I would still emphasize that you can see the ""photon tau=0"" as a ?kind of conjecture? from Minkowski diagrams.  Fuck it, \*I\* think I can! :-D  


&gt;In the same way that E = mc² doesn't apply to a photon, other formulas don't apply either.

What?  No, but E = p²c² + (mc²)² does, and I don't see which mark this 'analogy' misses even?  


&gt;That's not the point. The question is how do you switch into the rest  frame of a photon in the first place.  You cannot do that. 

We have absolutely no argument about this.  Also, I don't see how this is relevant at all.

&gt;Yes, the coordinate system collapses. How does that have to apply to an actual photon (especially when it's bloody obvious stuff's proper time on a track goes asymptotically to zero as v -&gt; c).

No, no, no. Again, completely oblivious to the mathematical details, i.e. ignoring the physical situation here. These results where you ""nonchalantly"" plug in c for v are derived requiring v &lt; c. It's not a ""valid extrapolation"", you can't even purely mathematically take a limit there (the limit of the Lorentz boost v ⭢ c doesn't exist). So the conclusions you advocate are nonsensical.

It's not a valid coordinate transform if it isn't invertible. That's just the very basics of .. I was about to say manifolds but it's even more basic than that, it applies in basic vector spaces in linear algebra. A coordinate transform can't be singular. The image space doesn't even have the same dimensionality as the preimage. That's just nonsensical.

It's not the person pointing this out that is the denialist with fallacious reasoning, it's the other way around. 

&gt;The reason why this is made such a big of a deal, really, is beyond me

I think you need to work through the mathematical derivations in special relativity while really making yourself aware what the assumptions being made are at all times. This tells you in which situations they are valid.

&gt;the only things relevant here are that the photons travel in straight lines

What's relevant here is that you can boost into the frame of the object at hand (can't for a photon for geometric reasons, this is a major feature of the geometry of special relativity).

That just tells you that you used a singular (and non invertible) coordinate transformation. In other words an illegal transform. It doesn't make sense to use a coordinate transform of a 2d plane that basically collapses the two axes onto each other.

And no Lorentz transform does this either, Lorentz transforms are parametrized by v with |v| from [0, c) or if you want by a rapidity [0, infinity). There is no Lorentztransform for v = c. Any Lorentz transform puts you in yet another frame where a light speed object moves at the speed of light. There are no frames where it would be at rest.

&gt;Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. This is normally taken as the definition of inertia. The key point here is that if there is no net force acting on an object (if all the external forces cancel each other out) then the object will maintain a constant velocity. If that velocity is zero, then the object remains at rest. If an external force is applied, the velocity will change because of the force.

A course in numerical mathematics would be enormously useful.

And a course or three in the basics of computer science / programming is pretty much essential by your 3rd year.

The numerics and comp sci prepare you for doing actual lab or research work experience in your 4th year.  Pretty much all data collection and analysis involves some programming these days and it is very helpful  having formal training in that regard.  Actual research work can involve a lot of pretty extensive computer modeling (and comparing the modeling to actual data collected from the field).

While physics is the foundation that prepares you for astrophysics in grad school, working in a year of introduction to astrophysics in your 2nd or 3rd year will help you understand whether you will really enjoy this specialty.

Openstax has free open source college level material from the best books/people. 

Khan academy is bae when it comes to learning math so check that out too. Calculus should take you like 2-3 weeks of decent decent studying to finish all of calculus 1 (it’s really not that hard) or at least enough so that you’d do fine in physics.

As particle physics question: Particle wave functions are always spread out a bit. To form a black hole you need particles to be localized better than the Schwarzschild radius of these particles. This means you need a minimal energy of the order of the Planck energy, and corresponding mass (via m=E/c^(2)). We don't know the physics under these conditions well enough to determine the prefactor, but it will be in this general range.

There is some hope that gravity becomes stronger at small length scales, in that case the ""true"" Planck mass could be lower and what we see as effective Planck mass isn't the real limit.

Neptune's gravity is trying to rip the parts of Triton closest to it away from the rest of the moon and into a faster orbit! This force is known as a *tidal force*.

Right now, the gravitational pull between Triton's rocks holding Triton together is stronger than the tidal force from Neptune pulling Triton apart. However, as Triton slowly spirals closer to Neptune, Neptune's gravity gets stronger and stronger. When Triton gets within a certain distance of Neptune, (termed Neptune's *Roche limit*), Neptune's gravity will *succeed* in ripping away the parts of Triton closest to it! As the remnants of Triton spiral past the Roche limit, they too will be ripped away, until Triton has completely disintegrated. All that will be left of Triton is a beautiful set of rings. (This is how Saturn got its rings - it shattered a moon!)

Triton weighs 10,000x less than Neptune. Crossing the Roche limit will be catastrophic for Triton, but Neptune will plow on unaffected.

With a master's you will not qualify for a faculty position or a principal researcher position at any university, here or in Europe. You might get a technician position with NASA or ESA. But you will not get a full research position. Those require a PhD. 

Even with a PhD, there are many, many applicants for each job. A lot of very qualified people leave the field because they can't find a position.

But if you love it, go for it. Get a PhD. But make sure you have some options. Learn to program well. That will give you a big edge applying for astro jobs. And, you will have a fallback skill.

8055,"Astrophysics and aerospace engineering are pretty much unrelated fields. The only thing they have in common is the math and classical mechanics courses.

If you plan to go to engineering grad school, wouldn't it be better to get a BS in engineering?

The design of undergrad programs is to allow students to try out various specialties. There are two parts to that. One part is to let you see if you really like the field and find the material interesting. The other part is to show that you can do the work and actually become proficient in the field.

With a physics BS, you can probably get admitted to an engineering MS program. But you are going to be perpetually behind the other students who majored in engineering as undergrads. 

If you're interested in astrophysics but want to be an aerospace engineer, just major in engineering and take some Astro electives.

8069,"If I understand you correctly, you're asking about a solar eclipse that is annular at Earth's surface, and how far you would have to move toward the Moon before the eclipse would be total?

The worst case for this would be when the Moon is at apogee and Earth is at perihelion. That's when the Sun looks the largest, and the Moon looks the smallest. At perihelion the Sun is 147.1 million km from Earth, and its radius is 696,340 km. So in order to see a total eclipse, you must be close enough to the Moon that the ratio between its distance and radius is equal to or less than that:

Distance / radius for the Sun at perihelion:

147,100,000 km / 696,340 km = 211.25

So the distance we need to the Moon is 211.25 multiplied by the radius of the Moon:

distance = 211.25 \* 1737 km = 366,900 km.

So if the Moon is closer than 366,900 km we should always see a total (not annular) eclipse, even when we are at perihelion. The farthest the Moon gets from Earth at apogee is 406,700 km. So in this worst case scenario, the distance from Earth we would need in order to see a total eclipse is 406700 - 366900 = **39,800 km**. That's from the center of the planet, so you can subtract about 6400 km for Earth's radius and get about 33,400 km altitude above the ground. That's a little lower than geosynchronous orbit.",1587511841,astrophysics,jswhitten,Astrophysics,Comment,249

That being said: objects rotating around a body will generally keep that same orbit. It is a semi-misconception that black holes are huge vacuums that suck everything up that comes near it. It is just an object with a very large gravitational pull. Think how earth doesn't slowly get sucked into the sun.

That being said: there is some truth to the vacuum concept. Black holes are weird, and obviously don't always follow Newton's laws. There's a thing called the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit, or ISCO. This is the smallest possible circular orbit an object can take without eventually falling into the black hole. For a non-rotating black hole, the radius of this orbit R_ISCO is 3 times the Schwarzschildradius, which is basically the radius of the black hole. The faster it rotates, the smaller R_ISCO will get.

8139,"Technically,  everything you said is correct. And yes, it's hard to get a faculty position or a real job in astro.  (Not as unlikely as a rock star. But difficult.) You will have to move, you will have multiple postdocs unless you are a super, super star AND very lucky. And a lot a really smart people are forced to leave the field to get a job.

A majority of the work is looking at digital data from telescopes and satellites. No one puts their eye to the telescope for actual work these days.

But what your answer does not capture is the absolute  thrill of looking at an emission or absorption spectrum, identifying elements and calculating a distance. Or looking at a light curve and finding a planet. Figuring out the secrets of the Universe, tiny piece by tiny piece, is the best job in the world. And sometimes you figure out something that changes the world. (Margaret Burbidge and her collaborators (BBFH) discovered that elements are synthesized in stars.  She died this week at 100.)

Anyway, even if you don't put your eye to the eyepiece, standing in the chill of the night, on the catwalk of a huge telescope, looking up at the Universe is exciting and wonderful and moving. 

If you love the subject, if it makes your heart go flutter-flutter, there is nothing like it. I have the first quasar spectrum I ever studied, framed and hanging in my stairwell. It has my redshift calculations on it and it makes me smile every time I notice it.

Take a shot at it if you love it. But be realistic. Major in physics. Take a lot of math. Learn to program well. Make sure you have some options.

8142,"/0. Major in physics, not astrophysics. You will have the exact same options with a physics major, plus a lot more in the likely case that you decide to go into a different area of research or industry. You lose nothing with physics.

&gt; 1. a. what is the job field like? what kinds of jobs are available for astrophysics majors? is it realistic?

Jobs are pretty rare tbh, especially if we're talking about astrophysics-specific. Outside of academia, there's basically only space policy stuff or observatory stuff. For the former, most will have a mixed political/law background. For the latter, it's engineering and science communication, and those positions are both incredibly rare and incredibly sought after because the bar for entry is lower. 

Within academia, jobs are scarce. There's a few 10s every year around the world, but since each position isn't looking for an ""astrophysicist"", they're looking for a *specific specialisation* in astrophysics, the number in practice is much lower. There may be only 2-3 jobs in the entire world that you're well-suited for, and they might be in Bolivia, China, and France while you're in the US. Moving country is common. Working at perhaps less impressive universities is common. It's not a sign of failure or weakness, those are the few jobs and only the best will get them. And that's after doing your Bachelors, (Masters+) PhD, and a few postdocs. 

Wanting to be an astrophysicist is like wanting to be a rockstar: it's fine to have dreams and even to work towards them, but it's a stretch, you're not likely to succeed, and so you need to identify now when you're going to throw in the towel. How many years will you languish in the postdoc market or be unemployed before you go do something else?

&gt; b. is it recommended that i pursue a masters degree as well?

If you want to do astrophysics then you need to go up to PhD and postdoc before you can get a job. If you want to go into a non-astro area like software engineering or finance, you might need a Masters in a more relevant subject. Or you can plan ahead now and get that non-physics experience during undergrad.

&gt;2) what is the study of this field like?

Not like you imagine.

Lots of people imagine that we're staring up at the sky, fiddling with telescopes, and asking deep questions about the origins of the Universe. We're not. I work from a computer, at my desk. I answer pretty esoteric and niche questions about physical processes that have no discernible impact on humans. We don't make groundbreaking discoveries, we only submit incremental insights and snippets of progress into the collective knowledge, most of which is never actually read by anyone. By-and-large, we do math and programming, but generally to a rather incompetent level compared to experts in those domains and you either live with that shame or you're in denial (or naive). We're the Universe's meter-readers. We try to categorise the values ""Re"" can take in a range of physical and unphysical situations, we don't ask ""what is time?"". 

Real astrophysics is not very glamorous and the daily work is more similar to an accountant.",1587083698,astrophysics,astro-temp,Astrophysics,Comment,537

It's a hugely interesting field, if that's your thing. But it's one of the sciences where funding gets cut in hard times.

And, yes, you pretty much need a PhD to do research or teach at the University level. You can teach astro at a community college with a master's.

Our models are more or less consistent with what we see, but it is very difficult to model what's going on there. We have little data, and we expect that a lot of different things happen there.

Now, a lot of emission is actually from the region surrounding the SMBH. THe gas there is hot and therefore emits line radiation. By the way, quasars are generally just a subtype of AGNs, typically ones with a very high luminosity and a very high 'efficiency'.

slightly different techniques, but if you are interested in parameter estimation, then photometric redshifts are a good place to start. in the expanding universe, redshift is the primary way to measure distances to galaxies. while a spectrum is usually the best way to make a solid redshift measurement, it is possible to get an okayish redshift estimate just from broadband colours; this is called a photometric redshift. you can get big catalogues of galaxy colours, and also spectroscopic redshifts for some of those galaxies. you can use those spec-zs for training, and use ML to get photometric redshift estimates from the colours. google: ‘machine learning photometric redshift’.

8221,"Never said a double major would help me over pure physics majors in getting into grad school - but it does provide you knowledge in astrophysics that would otherwise have to be learned in grad school, so it’s helpful from that perspective (also because it is potentially easier to get research as undergrad in astronomy if you are part of the program). 
The reason most astronomy majors do not go to grad school is because 1. Grad school is difficult to get into (which is not exclusive to astronomy) and 2. many may decide not to or may pursue a career in something entirely unrelated. However like I said, at Umich, the program specifically preps its students for grad school.
I actually didn’t say that the department encouraged its students to double major in physics. It is simply a common thing to do because it is fairly easily. And look I do agree that a double major in astronomy and physics is a lot more valuable than just astronomy.
And I agree getting a good job right after undergrad as an sole astronomy major is very difficult - not really what I was focused on though.
Yes a bit of realism is important, but that wasn’t really what I was targeting in what you said. The main thing I took issue with was the implication that astronomy majors have poor physics/math fundamentals. That is why I originally spoke up because the statement doesn’t make sense when an astrophysics degree is essentially a physics degree; this is as far as my experience goes. Maybe there are astronomy majors out there where the only requirement is identifying constellations but that is clearly not what is being talked about. I also just found it misleading to say that an astrophysics degree should never be pursued in comparison to a physics degree when there is a very clear option in doing both, which like I said, does have benefits even if not for getting into grad school.",1586816127,astrophysics,chliu1855,Astrophysics,Comment,333

8223,"First of all, I made it very clear that I am commenting on the astronomy bachelors, not on the double majors, since that's OPs question (they are asking about astrophysics, not physics).

Secondly, you're starting to contradict yourself. You previously said that the general assumption of astronomy undergraduate programs is that people continue to graduate school. I provided the numbers to you that prove that in reality most graduates from these programs do NOT end up in graduate school.

Third, the percentages DO tell the full story - feel free to do your own analysis if you don't trust me, the data are all public. Getting in astronomy grad school is hard, as an astronomy BSc you will be competing with the physics BSc, and experience shows that a) the latter have an advantage compared to the pure astronomy BSc ones, and b) a double major does not give you an advantage. Your implied assumption is that a double major will help you, but this is just not true - neither for the UMich double degree or any of the other degrees. Michigan is not better or worse than any of the other good state schools in this respect. That the degree might give you an advantage is how these degrees are marketed to prospective students, because independent departments in a university are typically strongly pressured into also offering at least one major, so astronomy departments have a very strong incentive of offering one (and they need students for this), but the fact that many astro departments also suggest to their students to double major speaks for itself. Again, this is true all over the US - UMich is not special here, and, because of the larger perceived (and real) value of physics, they're doing you a favor by emphasizing the double major. 

Fourth, getting a permanent job in astronomy is even harder than getting into graduate school. Been there, done that. I was one of the very few lucky ones. I still recommend that people who want to try getting a professional astrophysics job to do so, but you definitively need a backup plan, and that backup plan better communicate to future potential employers outside of astronomy that you do not have tunnel vision. As I said before, for those people who managed to get into graduate school the backup plan is built in because a PhD is a high level qualification, but this is not true for the astronomy BSc. Again: you, as a double major, will be getting a job because your degree says ""physics"" on it, not ""astronomy"". 

Do I regret having done astrophysics: no, I enjoy every day of it and I get paid for my hobby. I even find time to argue about these things on reddit ;).

Additionally, I think the percentages don’t tell the whole story. Many universities simply don’t offer astrophysics majors, and many people may decide to major in physics and then specifically focus on astrophysics in grad school. I’m also not certain how general rates for grad school acceptance apply here. That’s not something that specifically applies to people with a bachelors in astrophysics, I highly doubt the numbers are significantly better for pure physics majors. If one isn’t looking to go to grad school, then I agree a physics major is better for 99% of cases. Like I said though, that’s what my program is set up for, and grad school acceptance rates don’t factor in for me whether this is something I should be doing. It might be all or nothing in some people’s eyes but there’s an inherent gamble you have to be willing to take if you’re looking to go to grad school.

8226,"Let me be blunt: It turns out that the major problem people have in graduate programs is not the astronomy or astrophysics background, but the physics background. That's the point I've been trying to make in the previous posts. This might be different for your peers and some PhD students, but I would bet that I have a much larger sample size than you do. 

Anyway, the above is true irrespective of whether you will end up in graduate school or leave the field for industry. In addition, while the \*assumed\* track for people who enter astronomy programs is to go to grad school, in reality most of them will not make it. Just [take a look at the statistics](https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/rosters/astrost18.pdf): According to the American Institute of Physics, in 2018, US institutions conveyed 596 Astronomy BScs. There were 241 new astronomy graduate students. So, even if you assume that all of these graduate students had an astronomy BSc, 60 percent did NOT continue to graduate school (forget about gap years and things like that, we're doing order of magnitude estimates here). In reality, however, [40% of the first year graduate students are non-US citizens](https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/first-year-graduate-students-physics-and-astronomy-characteristics-and-background) and often will not have gotten their degree in the US. Furthermore, I would bet that much more than 50% of all of the new graduate students have a physics and not an astrophysics degree - the AIP data that I link to do not separate between these two degree tracks, but if I look at my US collaborators and talk to the graduate students there, it is rare to talk to somebody with an astronomy BSc (this includes ivy league universities, good state schools, and, yes, I also collaborate with people at UMich). If you fold that information into the statistics, including the very optimistic assumption that 50% of all new astronomy graduate students have an astronomy BSc, the probability that somebody pursuing an astronomy BSc ends up in graduate school is on the order of 10%. In all likelihood this is an overestimate of the real number. And this is why my arguments matter.",1586809232,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,349

He should take into consideration that he may not even want to complete the astro major or even like it once he starts to get into it.

For me personally when I was applying to colleges, I was pretty set on mechanical engineering as a major. I applied to several colleges known for their engineering programs but got rejected from most. I ended up going to Rutgers because it was the cheapest option, but in hindsight it was a really good that I ended up there because I quickly discovered that I really did not want to do ME at all and switched to astro instead. 

Now it's entirely possible your son may get into the astro courses and discover it's not for him, which is perfectly reasonable and acceptable. I think that it may be a more advantageous option to go to the cheaper in state school to get his toes wet and see what he really wants to commit to before taking out large life altering loans. If he was already accepted to these other schools, he probably won't have trouble transferring to them a year down the line if he wants to.

Wherever your son goes, as a motivated honor student, he will have the opportunity to succeed.

College is definitely more “get out what you put in” than high school. If he goes out of his way to make connections, join clubs/groups, and succeed in his studies, then what school he went to for his undergraduate studies (out of those three) will have little consequence on how successful he is, because he will have very good prospects for his graduate studies, which means very good prospects for a lifelong career.

Let me put it like this: putting your son or family an additional $55k in the hole (or more with loans) will hold his success back far more than any differences when choosing between three very good schools for undergraduate studies.

Personal preference is somewhat important, sure. I’m sure he has reasons for why he likes one school over the other, but those small preferences probably aren’t worth $55k. I’m not saying “put your foot down and tell him that money is more important,” but now is definitely the time for him to start thinking about how money relates to preferences in life. I would prefer to drive a car that is $55k more expensive than my current one, but it would be unreasonable to take a loan out for that money if all I’m getting is tinted windows and dice hanging from the mirror.

Before Python,  astronomers used [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)), but they shifted quite rapidly to Python because of its ease of use, especially for simple data reduction, plotting etc. Astropy though is quite commonly used but it would not be the only measure of how popular Python is in the astronomy community.

8249,"This is my experience from working in the field for the past 20 years (and on both sides of the Atlantic), and just looking at what my graduates and people I did research with and left the field experienced. At the PhD level, what you are saying is true since a PhD is a high level qualification and those companies that hire PhDs in the first place know enough about the field. But these companies do not tend to people who have just a bachelor's degree. Here, the typical time for the job search for people who majored in astronomy have more of a problem. The reason is that people who do not double major in physics, computer science, or maths have less of the quantitative background that allows them to transit over to industry. Now, given that STEM jobs are sought for, I am not saying that the people don't get a job - unemployment in STEM is very low - but I am saying that they tend to take longer to find something appropriate.

I also see a similar trend when hiring people for a PhD position - people with a physics BSc have a deeper knowledge of the fundamental physics that is needed in astrophysics than people who only had a minor in physics or didn't do physics at all. The reason is that their education was too narrow - many of the subjects that people want to avoid when majoring in astronomy, such as maths, solid state physics, and even chemistry, are relevant in many areas of astrophysics. Astronomy BScs tend to be good observers, but, well, most of the job is not going observing, but interpreting the data with models that are rooted in physics and at a very high statistical level that exceeds that of typical data science BSc programs. Point in case: take a look at the faculty CVs of your institution and count how many of them majored in astronomy for their BSc.... So, my recommendation stands: get a broad physics background and then specialize later. Do some astronomy as an undergraduate in order to motivate yourself, do REUs in astronomy, and ask astronomy professors whether you can do a small research project with them.

Green in aurora is interaction between charged particles in the solar wind with oxygen in the atmosphere

https://www.space.com/15139-northern-lights-auroras-earth-facts-sdcmp.html

The green flash is due to Raleigh scattering sunlight:

""This fleeting spectacle is caused by the refraction of sunlight, which is particularly significant at sunset and sunrise, when the light travels through more of the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere bends the sunlight passing through it, separating the light into its different colors, much like a prism bends and splits sunlight into rainbows, according to Cornell University.

The various colors of light bend different amounts based on their wavelengths; shorter wavelengths (blue, violet and green) refract more strongly than longer wavelengths (yellow, orange and red). As such, blue and violet light are scattered by the atmosphere while red, orange and yellow are absorbed, leaving the green light the most visible during the few seconds when the sun sets below or rises above the horizon.""

8300,"I'm submitting a slightly different take on this; the standard lithany is available [everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe).   


According to Einstein's general relativity, the ""fabric"" of spacetime can bulge, can curve.  The straight path from A to B might pass through curved spacetime (and appear non-straight to an observer).  Specifically, GR tells us that matter/energy is responsible for spacetime curvature, and that the curvature spacetime dictates the paths of free-falling matter/energy.  This is the modern explanation of gravitation.   


Universe being flat means that we should expect to find no ""extra"" gravitation of any sign in addition to gravitation from the contents (stars, gas, dust, radiation) of the universe.  The local spacetime around, say, the Sun is slightly non-flat, ie. curved, but as you move further away from the Sun then eventually you're in spacetime where you couldn't really measure or be effected by the curvature (gravitation) due to Sun.  This reasoning can be repeated across different scales, f.e. the local group of stars, or the Milky way, or the Local Group of galaxies, etc. etc. ad nausea.  In short, and if the universe were flat, then no matter the scale we're observing, we should always find trajectories that are described by the matter/energy content that is ""local"" to the observed (sub-)volume of spacetime.  


Incidentally, it also means that there's no center to the universe, and that the universe is infinite (or at least much larger than our observational horizon).  


Most of our ""direct"" measurements indicates a flat universe, ie. a global curvature of zero; however, the accelerating expansion of space indicates negative curvature.  Wherever we ultimately land on this, it does strongly appear that the universe is *very close* to flat, ie. any cosmological curvature, for the moment, remains small (as in negligible).",1586333831,astrophysics,ketarax,Astrophysics,Comment,289
8301,"[Obligatory not an expert]

Here is what I have heard from, mainly from Brian Cox and other physicists.

There are 3 overall shapes the Universe can have. 
Positive Curvature
Flat
Negative curvature

If the universe had positive curvature, it would be shaped like a sphere and would be finite. This also means that 2 lines drawn through space that start parallel would eventually converge. 

Negative curvature is like a saddle or a pringle. If the universe had negative curvature, two lines that start parallel would diverge. I *think* the universe would be finite in this situation too.

Flat would mean that two lines that start parallel will stay parallel forever. This allows the universe to be infinite. 

Another way to define these scenerios is:
Positive curvature: angles of a triangle add up &gt; 180°
Flat: angles of a triangle add up = 180°
Negative curvature: angles of triangle add up &lt; 180°",1586333336,astrophysics,BobaFettyWap333,Astrophysics,Comment,152

8304,"I research black hole accretion disks (specifically SMBHs), and as far as I know, this isn't much of an area of study. The main problem is that **we don't see accretion disks anywhere**. Aside from the single EHT result, we've never seen that far down and the next best thing is a single blob. We infer their existence because we see accretion disks around protostars and protoplanets, and we see variable lightcurves that indicate moving material very close in to the black hole, and you can use things like reverberation mapping or reprocessing to indicate that there's some material too. We then create models and simulations, de-resolve them to buggery, and compare to observations to see if they're realistic. Pretty much the entire field is build up this way.

But if you don't have a direct image of the accretion disk, or evidence of variability, or evidence of reprocessing, that doesn't mean there isn't a disk. There is currently no set of evidences that would indicate a *lack* of a disk. Each missing data point can easily be attributed to something else, like a specific disk configuration, activity level, or the presence of other strong features that wash out the disk data. Good luck seeing evidence of an accretion disk if you're staring directly down the barrel of a relativistic jet of plasma, e.g. blazars. Good luck seeing an accretion disk in a very faint or low-activity AGN. 

If accretion disks do dissipate then they do so on timescales much longer than we can observe, and again, if we suddenly stopped seeing signatures of an accretion disk where we previously saw them, there are a million things we can attribute that to *before* we start thinking that the disk is gone. 

If we're talking about IMBHs or stellar-mass then the default is more likely to have no disk as they could be anywhere, not necessarily in a reservoir they can pull from. We only see these when nearby stars get a bit too close.",1586324821,astrophysics,astro-temp,Astrophysics,Comment,334

One thing to note here is this method does not work for all stars, only ones that are close enough for us to observe a shift in position due to parallax. 

But the reason why it's so important that we're able to do this is because it gives us what's called a [standard candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder). See we can easily tell how far a star is away from us if we know how bright it is. Or we can tell how bright a star is by compensating for how far away it is. But that leaves us with a chicken or the egg problem. How can we know how bright any given star truly is if we don't know the distance, and if we don't know the distance how do we know how bright the star is?

The way to get around that is now that we know the distance to certain stars using parallax, we can determine what their actual brightness is (known as absolute magnitude). Then we can find similar stars that are even further out (too far to use parallax) and estimate the distance to them because now we have a good estimate on how bright they are. 

This method of leapfrogging standard candles is how we measure distances in the universe.",1586207579,astrophysics,RUacronym,Astrophysics,Comment,219

8330,"I think I may understand where your confusion is coming in. 

The idea here is that a star that is moderately far away from us will shift its position in the sky relative to the other stars, which we assume are stationary. The reason for the shift is that when the Earth is on one side of the sun, it sees the star from a slightly different angle relative to the other stars in the sky from when the Earth is on the opposite side of the sun.

So in summer you measure angle p1 and in the winter you measure angle p2. They will be different. If you add them together you get: 2alpha. Then dividing 2alpha by 2 to get alpha, you can construct the right angle triangle in your diagrams. 

The reason why you NEED that difference is this [image here](https://imgur.com/a/Aq7lyrm), really sorry for my bad image edit skills.

See if you measure the top angle for the yellow line, that does not give you the distance to the star. It only gives you A LINE of possible points at which the star could be on. The only way to figure out its true position is to measure the angle of the red line. Thus you have two lines at which the star could be, thus you can work backwards using the angles you've measured to determine its true position.",1586198974,astrophysics,RUacronym,Astrophysics,Comment,233
8332,"You are assuming that there is a way to measure the direction given by the bottom horizontal line.  The problem is that if you just measure the angle between the horizontal line and the direction to the star, well, you have the direction to the star, but how would you determine its distance if you just know the angle? You can't. For this you need to do a second  measurement and see how the angle has changed (this is how things are done in practice, because the angles are very small, in practice we astronomers measure these angles many times over the course of multiple years).

Perhaps it helps to explain this with something less abstract. Sit down and take a look at something that is 3-4 feet away from you, say your computer screen. Close your left eye, look at it with your right eye, then close the right eye and look at the screen with your left eye. You see that it is""jumping"" back and forth with respect to things that are farther away. It is by measuring this angular shift and by knowing the separation between your eyes that your brain determines the distance to the screen.

Basically, you assume that the really far stars are totally stationary (after cataloguing thousands of star positions throughout the year, you'll be able to figure out which are moving relative to each other and which are not. The ones that are not are the really far ones). Then you measure the right ascension and declination of the stars that are moving in the sky at two points in the year. The addition in angles of those two measurements should be 2*alpha.",1586198101,astrophysics,RUacronym,Astrophysics,Comment,109

Parallax is an angle, measured in arc seconds (there are 60 arcminutes in a degree, and 60 arcseconds in an arcminute).

Measuring the parallax gets you 2α.   Divide by 2 to find α and solve for the distance.

2α is a better measurement as it's bigger, so the measurement will be more accurate.   These are *very* tiny angles.",1586197267,astrophysics,Psychedeliciousness,Astrophysics,Comment,67

8340,"So when you say, ""consistently different - how could we ever tell"".  And that's exactly my question.

&amp;#x200B;

But you've reminded me of how impossible our universe would be with only the slightest of changes.  Your example of fusion, for example.  If the forces were a little bit stronger, or a little bit weaker, everything would either fuse in a nanosecond, or nothing would ever fuse.  And in this scenario, assuming the Sun was the \*ONLY\* star that was in this range, we couldn't see any other stars.

&amp;#x200B;

So for any postulation of local solar governance of fundamental calculations of physics to be possible, then some thoughts occur to me.  
  1.  Every star in the sky has fallen roughly within the extremely narrow range of possible forces to allow for it to exist.

  2. These conditions would most likely be the baseline for the universe, or the stars couldn't form in the first place.

  3.  If my idea \*could\* be true, it would require all the tiny ranges within which physics is proven to work would still need to work outside of those tiny ranges --somehow-- &lt;hand wave&gt;.  All of physics current best models would be impossibly broken, yet somehow still fit neatly within predictable mathematical models.",1586191139,astrophysics,Axelay_,Astrophysics,Comment,208

No. Quantum entanglement has nothing to do with acoustic waves, and even if it did, quantum entanglement still doesn't allow FTL information transfer.

You are, but we don't even need to bring up QM here. This is purely the realm of relativity. Sound is just particles bumping into each other, right?

8347,"Perhaps a different take than the comments here:

In our current understanding of physics, nothing can go faster than the speed of light *in a vacuum*. However, in a denser medium, the speed of light decreases. When a particle (with mass) such as an electron enters a medium with a higher speed than the speed of light *in that medium*, the particle will lose energy through a process called cherenkov radiation. The particle will emit photons to lose speed, and travels at the proper speed of light of the medium in which it is traveling.

As for your question: sound waves are just particles interacting with each other (one particle “bumping” into another). When particles bump faster into each other than the local speed if light allows, they will quickly lose energy in the form of emitted photons, i.e. cherenkov radiation.",1586161739,astrophysics,prometheus345,Astrophysics,Comment,141
8348,"I'm not much of a theoretical physicist, but I am an acoustic consultant as my day job, so I'll offer my two cents. Acoustic waves are a transverse wave caused by compression and rarefaction of particles in a medium.

The particles themselves cannot oscillate faster than the speed of light, as this would violate general relativity. Something that is used to describe acoustic waves is called the peak particle velocity, which is the fastest the particle will move during its oscillation (remember at the two extremes of the oscillations articles are momentarily static). This can never be faster than the speed of light.

However, this is different from the wave speed. The wave speed will depend of this peak particle velocity, but also on a range of other factors like density and temperature. The PPV is orders of magnitude smaller than the wave speed. So in theory, the wave could travel at the speed of light without any single particle violating the laws of general relativity, as no actual molecule will be traveling faster or as fast as light - the acoustic wave is not a real thing.

Now there may well be other reasons this can't happen that I can't think of using my day to day experience, such as perhaps friction dissipating too much energy at the densities and temperatures needed to achieve this wave speed. But given this is pretty specific scenario that is not common on earth, I don't think I'm going to be much help past this point.

Just for a reference, the speed of sound at atmospheric pressure and room temp is around 343 m/s.

At the SOFAR depth in the sea, (point of the sea with the fastest speed of sound due to the specific temperature and high pressure encironment) is around 1550 m/s.

Thats a very significant range of environmental conditions for only a 5 fold increase. So to increase the local speed of sound up to light spewed I think you'd be looking at unfathomable dense materiala, again which may start behaving in weird and wonderful ways I couldn't predict.",1586157351,astrophysics,adnams94,Astrophysics,Comment,349

What I'm trying to communicate is that *c* mediates more than just the speed of light, or even the speed of cause and effect. It's true that if the speed of light was changed as light entered the solar system, it might be hard to tell.  

It's important to understand that if *c* were different, many fundamental processes would not work the way that we see them to work. Even tiny differences in *c* would have huge effects on more complicated processes like fusion, or supernovae, or many many simpler things.   

As an example - look at the electromagnetic force. We say that the EM force is 'mediated' by photons, which is to say that photons carry the electromagnetic force. Many, many, many things depend on this force. Fusion, the way that dust clouds within galaxies heat up, how planets and stars form due to radiative cooling, etc. If *c* were different, these processes would also be different. Yet we observe the processes to work the same in other galaxies as they do here on Earth.  

To sum up - *c* has effects on many higher order processes. **Even if the speed of light were being changed near our sun, we would still accurately see how large scale systems like planetary formation are working far away.**  Yet these systems behave the same way as they do in smaller scales here on Earth.

I've also heard it said that space and time is referred to as spacetime because the two are locked together at the hip.  The more of one you have, the less of the other.

So if the universal constant is a measure of information transfer across a substrate, and there are clear and precise measurements to demonstrate that this substrate can be altered to create local frames, I don't think it's a super physics breaking consideration to postulate that the sun might be also influencing the signal processing speed within its sphere of influence.

I'm also not sure what things would be observable as 'broken' outside of that sphere of influence  that would clearly and obviously disprove it.  I can imagine distant bodies being closer or farther away than the models predict. Moving towards one another faster/slower than predicted.  But if something is closer than thought, moving away from something else that's farther away than expected, this assumption that 'c' is universal and fixed would only result in inaccurate conclusions about how close/far something is, or how old, or how bright.

This is very true! There is a huge amount of physics based on this fundamental constant, and I think that be underestimating how *much* of it is. Consider things like stellar radiative transport models, the physics of fusion, gravitational lensing, supernovae, and many others.  

All of these things would be very different if the value of *c* were different. They give us rigorous and *independent* confirmation of the value for *c*, as do many other more focused experiments.  

I want to be clear - if you are trying to prove the value of *c*, there are many more basic experiments.

At the very core of all of this, I see \`c\`.  The solid rock upon which so much of everything has been built.  I considered for a moment, that even if it were wrong, it would be right.

It's \*OUR\* limit, and that's really all we need to know about.

This led me to consider how it \*COULD\* be wrong.  And my attention fell upon the Sun.  It pushes back and blocks so much of the radiation that would sterilize this solar system.  It holds everything around it in some sort of order.  And if some of the fuzzy sciency bits around gravity and the deeper magiks of some deeper particles haven't quite been fully understood, perhaps something in the tangle of unknowns could influence our perceptions by applying system wide uniformity within the local influence that is unique to the size/shape/density etc.

More poignantly, note that Voyager sends radio messages back to Earth via the Deep Space Network.

8492,"When you say you've ""learned Python"", what do you mean? Most tutorials on the web are aimed at a general audience using Python for systems or web app programming, whereas its use in science is a bit more specialised. So it's worth looking for a tutorial that's explicitly aimed at scientists/engineers as it'll likely cover a lot of the specifics. 

But briefly, the most important packages are those making up the [SciPy ecosystem](https://scipy.org/). The three most important are MumPy, which allows Python to perform fast mathematical calculations on arrays of values; SciPy, which contains all sorts of useful algorithms for working with that data; and matplotlib, which lets you produce high-quality figures/graphs from the data.

The sorts of techniques that are useful are basically those that are contained in SciPy: calculating statistical properties and lines of best fit for data; numerical integration, optimization and interpolation; and linear algebra techniques. You don't have to know how to code these from scratch, but they do take some practice to use. And you may not have learnt all the relevant maths yet, in which case I wouldn't worry too much about understanding them right now - just remember that they're there when you do catch up.

As to what programming is used for, there's huge variation depending on what sort of research you work on. Theorists write code to simulate the physics they are interested in, while observers catalogue and process the data they've collected. Both types of research then involve analysing that data and producing graphs or other visualisations from the results that ultimately will go into a scientific paper.",1585751856,astrophysics,nivlark,Astrophysics,Comment,268

8494,"The basic stumbling block is due to the diffraction limit of the angular resolution of a telescope. The angular resolution [;\Delta \theta;] is inversely proportional to the aperture diameter [;D;] of your telescope, i.e [;\Delta \theta \propto \frac{\lambda}{D};], where [;\lambda;] is the wavelength of light you are observing.

This is one of the key reasons why 'bigger is better' for telescopes. As you increase [;D;], the value of [;\Delta \theta;] decreases and you're getting a better angular resolution. But there are practical problems with building bigger and bigger telescopes as they require larger and larger optical elements. Large diameter mirrors are difficult and *expensive* to build.

One way to get around this problem is to move away from traditional telescope designs to *interferometry*, or radio telescopes. This is a technique that combines the signal from two or more single-dish radio telescopes into a synthetic telescope that has an equivalent aperture of the distance between the dishes!

For interferometer arrays such as ALMA, this baseline can be as large as 16km! Much, much larger than any feasible optical telescope design. 

The Event Horizon Telescope builds on this principle by combining signals from interferometers all around the planet to produce a synthetic telescope with a baseline of thousands of kilometers and thus an unparalleled level of angular resolution.

Of course, this isn't completely fool proof, and there are some draw backs to this technique. The telescope *isn't* as good as a theoretical telescope with an aperture diameter equal to the baseline length, but that's another story.",1585750427,astrophysics,ZwickysLeap,Astrophysics,Comment,254

You measure rotational velocity/period by measuring how long it takes a particular spot on a planet to rotate to its original position. Period IS the measured quantity, rather than a derived one.

You can work [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_speed) for angular velocity backward to figure out period, but you could just look up the values on google because at the end of the day, the astronomers are just watching the planets through a telescope with a stopwatch to figure it out.",1585708440,astrophysics,RUacronym,Astrophysics,Comment,143

If you want to make your wormholes as realistic as possible, they should be powered by some sort of “negative mass” (or negative energy) as this is the only thing (according to our current understanding of physics) that would allow a wormhole to be held open wide for a meaningful period of time. In real life, we have no evidence that this “negative mass” exists anywhere or that it is even possible. Note that this is different than antimatter, it is not simply matter with opposite charges but an actual negative sign next to the mass. (For example, a block of something that weighed -10 kg.) Also, there are different kinds of mass (inertial, gravitational, etc) which would give different results when negative so make sure you do your research (I think the Wikipedia article on this is pretty accurate so you could start there). If you want a realistic story, make sure you consider all possible uses and effects of new technology to avoid plot holes.

However, it would not be very significant, since the speed of a planetary orbit is only a small fraction of the speed of light. The fastest orbital velocity in our solar system - Mercury, at about 48 km/sec - is only about 0.016% the speed of light.

However, the story at the subatomic level is different. At that level, special relativistic effects are common. A commonly cited example is that of the [color of gold](https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/golden_glow/), and as the link points out, it is ""not only the colour of gold, but its immunity from tarnishing and corrosion are consequences of special relativity.""

But that's just a small symptom of a much broader phenomenon. The integration of special relativity with quantum mechanics was a critical aspect of the development of quantum field theory, which underlies the Standard Model of particle physics that all modern particle physics is based on.

Without the integration of special relativity, much of what we observe in the universe would still be mysterious - the [existence of antimatter](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/deep-probe-antimatter-puts-einstein-s-special-relativity-test), the way particles decay, what they absorb or reflect, etc. are all either or consequence of, or strongly affected by, special relativity. Without special relativity, we would expect all these features of the universe to be different.

In fact it's quite possible, even likely, that a naive Newtonian universe is not physically possible - e.g. that logical inconsistencies would arise, or that matter would not be stable in such a universe, etc. It's possible that to achieve a viable Newtonian-like universe, you'd need to introduce other apparent weirdness similar to that of relativity.",1585537646,astrophysics,antonivs,Astrophysics,Comment,291

8565,"It actually isn't so subtle.

If the universe is Newtonian, it implies special relativity doesn't hold.

However, special relativity is a direct mathematical consequence of the speed of light being constant in all reference frames. If special relativity doesn't hold, it implies that the speed of light cannot be constant across reference frames.

But the ""speed of light"" is a misnomer. It really refers to the maximum speed at which propagation of *any* signal can occur - including gravity, although that's not a Newtonian perspective.

If that speed is no longer constant, it will make for a totally different universe. Instead of signals being frequency-shifted across reference frames, their speed will change, becoming greater than or less than the current speed of light. 

This also implies that the speed of light will no longer be a limit for massive objects, since what previously stopped massive objects from reaching the speed of light was special relativity.

This all affects causality itself. If something is moving towards you, the light it emits will  reach you sooner than something moving away from you. This changes how objects can affect each other.

This isn't just an issue at the macroscopic level. It would affect interactions at the atomic and subatomic level too. The ripple effects from this would change everything.",1585511018,astrophysics,antonivs,Astrophysics,Comment,216

8627,"Interesting question! There are two main problems here.   

First, while you are correct that dark mark does appear to interact with itself gravitationally, the interaction seems to be weak. We don't see many 'clumps' of dark matter. No dark matter stars, planets, even smaller bodies. In our observations, dark matter seems to gather very diffusely.  

Second - as you said - dark matter does not interact with normal matter except for gravity. This is actually really important, because a better way of stating this is that dark matter does not interact with any of the *fundamental forces* except for gravity. As far as we can tell, dark matter has no interaction with the weak force, the strong force, or electromagnetism. All of the things that you think about being in a 'parallel universe' would require these interactions. You can't have stars without the strong force, nor atoms, nor molecules. With just gravity, it would be very difficult to create any kind of structure at all.  

Now you might be thinking - hold on, maybe these stars and planets would be *dark*, but surely gravity would allow dark matter to at least form some interesting structure! We don't fully understand why dark matter appears to gather so diffusely compared to normal matter/antimatter. However part of the reason is likely due to the lack of the electromagnetic interaction. When a big sphere of 'stuff' wants to contract - say, into a planet - energy (among other things) is conserved. But large collections of things are often rotating quickly and moving randomly, while a planet is a relatively slow rotating and well behaved mass - a state with less energy. Nature gets around this by allow energy to be diffused away from the original sphere of stuff. A main component of this is collision, which heats up the particles, thereby causing them to glow. This 'glowing' removes energy from the system, allowing it to coalesce. Dark matter *cannot do any of this*! It cannot collide, it cannot heat up, and it certainly cannot 'glow'.    

This is quite simplified, but I hope you found it helpful.

This was mostly a self contained course meaning no knowledge of differential geometry was expected. First 10 lectures cover the mathematics including some tensor calculus and differential geometry for what has to come with some physical intuitions (Not a complete differential geometry course). Then the rest of the course was about putting physics into geometry and solving the equations. The professor keeps you focused and makes feel like you're getting it and he explains the math very well. I followed 80% of the lectures and problem sets. I was able to grasp most of the content in the lectures but in problems it took some time to get used to the tricks and notation of this domain and after fees lectures I was able to solve more than 60% of the problems in a problem set on my own and with some more studying. Two problems I found after stopping it was I didn't have the physical intuition for Lagrangian and  classical mechanics.General Relativity is a classical theory and it is important to know what a Lagrangian and action is. The second problem is I didn't continue to see it used in any applications which are actually the cool part and I didn't use the knowledge of GR that I learned  anywhere. 
Now I won't say I know GR with full confidence. Yes, I am comfortable with the concepts and the mathematical structures that are used to build GR, but that's not enough or atleast not satisfying for me to say I know GR until I work something out on my own. 
I've bought Geometry and Spacetime by Sean Carroll but I am not reading it. I'm get ready with some basics covered.

8696,"This is a good question, however there's one thing you haven't factored in: conservation of angular momentum. When you extend the rod its length increases and so the angular velocity must decrease to preserve angular momentum. This is the same reason why a ballerina can slow down their spin by extending their arms and vice versa. 

Though a decrease in angular velocity doesn't necessarily mean a decrease in the velocity of the end of the rod, it's pretty easy to show that it does indeed slow down if you go through the math. The moment of inertia is proportional to the length squared, so if we increase the length by a factor of a &gt; 1 then the ratio of the final and initial angular velocities is ωf / ωi = 1/a² and since the angular velocity ω is proportional to inverse length we get that the ratio of the velocities is vf / vi = 1/a, which is less than 1.

And increasing the energy output won't work because it simply requires infinite energy to accelerate anything with mass to the speed of light. You can sort of think of this in terms of a ""relativistic mass"" whereby the mass increases without bound as the velocity increases (however I'd caution against this concept because it doesn't give consistent results in some places, e.g. force isn't proportional to the relativistic mass and actually has an extra kinetic term that in general isn't zero.

I would guess that they mean that if you were to look at an object in the sky at those coordinates, the line drawn from the center of the Earth to that object would be parallel to the line drawn by the axis of rotation of the asteroid.

Edit 2: Found [this](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/tb_coordconv.cfm) online calculator. The problem is that the plane of the ecliptic is offset by 23 degrees relative to the celestial equator, so you need to convert between the two. Plugging in -62 declination, and +91 right ascension in the epoch of 2000 yields:

&gt; -85.41884 Latitude(deg)     

&gt; 95.88792 Longitude(deg)      

And so what I THINK this is saying is that the axis of your asteroid is -85 degrees south of the plane of the ecliptic and 96 degrees eastward from the First Point of Aries which is the spot in the sky from which right ascension is measured. 

Anyone here with more experience with these coordinate systems, please feel free to correct me.",1585022433,astrophysics,RUacronym,Astrophysics,Comment,303

Join earth to the two stars in question (imaginary lines ofc.). Make a celestial sphere on the plane of the closer star. 

Now distance to both stars is a known value. You can easily look up the angular distance between the two stars. 

So the radius of the constructed celestial sphere is the distance to the closest star. Join the two stars. This will be a tangent to the constructed celestial sphere. 

You know the radius of the sphere, you know the distance of the point from the center of the sphere. It's easy to calculate the length of the tangent with the Pythagoras theorem. 

Of course, there's a lot of problems with this, the largest being that it works only if the two stars are in the same quadrant of the sphere. Still, worth a try.",1584964707,astrophysics,TooShyToSayILoveYou,Astrophysics,Comment,148

Title is pretty misleading though...

In order to estimate anything about axion-like particles via their transformation into photons, you need to know a lot about the magnetic field they're passing through, since that's what causes the transformation. Galaxy clusters are useful because they're so large, meaning there's a huge path length of magnetised material for it to pass through, potentially increasing the likelihood that you'd see one. **But** we don't know that much about cluster magnetic fields. Every time you try to measure them you can only see their effect in projection, so you only ever see the sum total magnetic field along the line of sight. There are lots of ways that field could be arranged, and with quite a range in strength. Those models are degenerate when doing something like rotation measure, but are hugely different when trying to estimate something as finicky as ALPs. A field that is up/up/down or up/down/up looks the same to a telescope but does not look the same to an ALP passing through. These are effectively matrix operations (i.e. rotations) and you can't arbitrarily change the order of matrix operations. AB != BA. 

There's still a lot more modelling and observing to do, so ALPs really haven't been ruled out yet. In fact, this area of study is only just now taking off. This isn't some kind of death blow.",1584875502,astrophysics,astro-temp,Astrophysics,Comment,245

8749,"It's important to distinguish between what physicists mean when they say dimension, compared to what it means in popular media (e.g. The Dark Dimension from Dr. Strange, which I'll use as an example).

In physics a dimension is basically just a variable, with the number of dimensions being the number of variables in your model. In terms of 'our universe', we describe it using three spatials variables (x,y,z) and a time variable (t). 

So a dimension isn't a sort of parallel world with strange multicoloured spheres floating around in it, but just a variable in an equation.

In physics, we use models with a varying number of dimensions in order to describe reality. Typically it's 3 spatial dimensions + 1 time dimension, but in some circumstances you use different numbers.

An electron on a carbon nanotube can be modelled with 1 spatial dimension and one time dimension. The electron can only 'tell' how far along the tube it is (very handwaivingly).

String theorists use models with 10's of dimensions in order to try and describe the universe. These dimensions are proposed to be curled up, so tiny we can't experience them in our normal perceptions.

So the takeaway is that dimension ~= variable, and that equations with a range of variables can be used to model the universe.

In this case, the laws of physics should be universal. All another “dimension” really is in this context, mathematically, is another variable. It would be like adding a ‘w’ to our ‘xyz’ plane. 

If, though, what you mean by dimension is really “would other universes have different laws”, then the answer is certainly. If our universe is one of many floating around as a bubble in a glass of cosmic beer, then there is no reason that the other bubbles would have to follow that same rules.

8800,"&gt;If the sun were to die, would Jupiter; the planet some feel is a failed star, merge with the sun that is enveloping everything and speed up the process? 

The Sun dying is the process of most of the hydrogen in the sun being fused into helium. The sun does not have enough mass to compress helium to the point where it would become hot enough to fuse. Absorbing Jupiter would add a minimal amount of hydrogen to the sun and wouldn't be enough to cause the sun to fuse again. The helium core of the sun would need to ignite and start fusing. Adding the mass of another star may do it, but Jupiter is nowhere near large enough.

By the way, when the sun starts to die, its volume will expand but the MASS will remain the same. Jupiter will still feel the same gravitational pull regardless of whether or not the sun is ""dead"" or not. To my knowledge the largest the sun will reach into the solar system when it becomes a red giant is just inside of Earth's orbit. So there would be no physical contact between the sun and Jupiter ever. Thus there would be no mechanism for which Jupiter would be absorbed into the sun. 

&gt; Or would the ingredients from the sun that Jupiter was missing, somehow activate and ignite Jupiter as a star and envelope the sun instead, becoming the new star of the solar system, and thus pulling in the surviving outer planets into a new gravitational pull? (Or would it just pull them in too quickly and destroy everything anyway? Or just explode either way? Or would the placement of the remaining outer planets make it difficult to pull in properly and create a collision course?)  

So like I said above, there would be no physical contact between the sun and Jupiter. If the mass of the sun, which at this point would be a core of helium surrounded by hydrogen, cannot transfer to Jupiter, then Jupiter would never become a star. The only plausible scenario I can see is if there is an unbelievably large coronal mass ejection which launches enough stellar material into the orbit of Jupiter (which would probably destroy all the inner planets in the process) so that Jupiter absorbs that mass eventually and ignites. But again, this event would require tremendous amounts of energy to pull off and would not just happen over the natural course of the solar systems lifecycle.  

&gt; And if this were a at all possible scenario, would the magnetosphere help in saving all of Jupiter's moons, making them the new inner planets and possibly making Europa inhabitable? Or would they be too close to Jupiter (the star) to survive? 

On the scales you're talking about, no objects in the inner solar system or orbiting Jupiter would survive such an event.

&gt; Also when I say ""if the sun dies and Jupiter is able to possibly absorb it and become a star"" I mean, when the sun starts dieing and is basically expanding and shedding its outer layers, will Jupiter be able to take those ingredients and ignite itself? 

When the sun dies it won't actually shed its outer layers like a supernova. It will become a red giant, then contract. But there wouldn't be an actual explosion. The sun just is not massive enough for that to happen.

&gt; And in this scenario, do you think the remaining core of the sun would be close enough to Jupiter (the star) that it would start essentially stealing back those ingredients (plus whatever ingredients Jupiter already had) in sort of a binary star system and create a Type1A supernova?? Or would Jupiter somehow survive?? I'm just curious if there's any possible way. And curious as to if this could even theoretically occur

There isn't enough mass in the entire solar system for the sun or Jupiter to become a type 1A supernova. IIRC you need at least 5x the amount of mass that's currently in the sun for it to become even the smallest of supernova's when it dies.

Side note: The scenario you're trying to make was explored in the book 2010 a space odyssey, the sequel to 2001 a space odyssey. The way Jupiter ignited in that book is that an alien race artificially compressed Jupiter with the presence of millions of monoliths (a technology and material way beyond our own). Thus it heated Jupiters core enough so that it could start to fuse hydrogen and it ignited into a small star. I'm not sure if it actually increased Jupiters mass permanently or if the monoliths had to remain in Jupiter to maintain this high pressure system. But without enormous external intervention like this, there is no feasible way that Jupiter will ever become a star.",1584480466,astrophysics,RUacronym,Astrophysics,Comment,807

8802,"Jupiter is too far from being a star. It would need to increase its mass by roughly 100 times. Jupiter is more massive than all the other planets combined but still means (almost) nothing to a star 
When the Sun will enter in the giant stage it will increase its size until engulfing the Earth and a little bit more, still very far away from Jupiter. I do not have time to do the math, but I am pretty confident that the mass of Jupiter is too low to strip any remarkable fraction of the Sun's envelope during this stage, and in the case that mass transfer actually starts, angular momentum conservation will make Jupiter sink into the Sun's envelope. From here on I have no idea if Jupiter is massive enough to consider this a ""Common Envelope"" event but my gut feeling is that it would just keep sinking until being completely disrupted.

8826,"&gt;Could this reason also be what caused the Big Bang?

Without dark energy you have expansion, but the composition of the universe could be such that the universe recollapses. You only get accelerated expansion when you add dark energy.

See [Friedmann model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations) which described the evolution of the universe (of the scale factor) depending on the ingredients of the universe.

&gt; I mean ""at some point"" there was an undisturbed singularity, why did it start expanding?

Big bang usually means that the universe was hot and dense initially and started rapidly expanding and cooling down, not so much ""an  initial moment in time"". It is unknown what happened very early in the universe and the theories we have (GR) are not thought to describe that situation accurately, so you can't assume ""there was a singularity"", it's more like ""singularity"" describes that theories break down this early in the universe.

&gt;I was thinking perhaps there was something else rising or increasing that at some point was great enough to ""disturb"" this singularity and therefore cause it to expand, and perhaps since this ""something"" continues on increasing, space expansion continues not just on its own, but It's also speeding up. 

Well read up on inflation (different from dark energy). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)

&gt;what if at some point this ""something"" that keeps rising will reach a critical limit and start decreasing or evenly suddenly disappear? I would speculate gravity would slowly start pulling everything in again and form one Big Crunch.

What if something counter to the evidence happens? The evidence points to the expansion of the universe will keep accelerating and the universe will end in heat death. So this is the most reasonable assumption. It points against a big crunch.

Generally there are cosmologyu textbooks out there that teach the topic. See for instance Ryden. We are not limited to making up stuff randomly on reddit posts :) Things have been researched and found out, knowledge has been collected in books.

If B rotates faster than once per orbit the near-side deformation is always ""behind"" (along the orbital path) - and is ""pulled forward"" by A, slowing the rotation and raising the orbit.

8847,"There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are quintessence, a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time. A negative mass cosmology does not assume that the mass density of the universe is positive (as is done in supernovae observations), and instead finds a negative cosmological constant. 

Dark fluid is an alternative explanation for accelerating expansion which attempts to unite dark matter and dark energy into a single framework.

Alternatively, some authors have argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe could be due to a repulsive gravitational interaction of antimatter or a deviation of the gravitational laws from general relativity, such as massive gravity, meaning that gravitons themselves have mass.

Another type of model, the backreaction conjecture, states that the rate of expansion is not homogenous, but we are in a region where expansion is faster than the background. Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion. This theory debunks any proposition of dark energy being involved. 

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration.",1584190934,astrophysics,powdercakez,Astrophysics,Comment,295

It says it inputs hydrogen and outputs hydrogen, meaning the input and output materials are the same (assuming they end with the same amount of hydrogen). No energy can be extracted like this. If there's fusion, the end results are heavier elements, period. Going back to light elements like the video claims would cost energy and make the whole process useless.

I'm an undergraduate at MIT and I work in a laser cooling lab - and while I definitely don't know what all the lab projects in MIT are or what they look like, I know of the big exciting ones (for which this would qualify), and I don't think I've ever heard of this.

A great book for entry level astrophysics is the one by Carroll and Ostlie, especially the 2nd version.",1584062686,astrophysics,Billman_D,Astrophysics,Comment,89
8887,"The blackbody radiation called Hawking radiation is NOT related to the fact the black hole ""absorbs"" light or matter crossing the event horizon. You are thinking of the event horizon as a physical object and yes, energy is conserved, but before Hawking applied QUANTUM thinking to black holes, it was thought perfectly possible that the energy just went IN to the event horizon and stayed there. 

What would happen to the energy inside the event horizon? Would it cause extreme heat and radiation? Doesn't matter, even radiation doesn't make it outside the event horizon (that's what defines the event horizon!) The Hawking radiation is coming from the BOUNDARY of the black hole, the event horizon itself, not from inside.

The temperature of the Hawking radiation is VERY low. Blackbody radiation has a peak wavelength. For example the Sun is close to a blackbody with a temperature of 5800 K, so that it is yellow-hot, and its radiation is brightest with a peak wavelength of 500 nanometers. Now the black hole's Hawking radiation will have a peak wavelength about as long as the diameter of the black hole. So if the Sun's mass were concentrated into a BH it would be about 3 miles across. Imagine radiation with such a long wavelength as MILES instead of the nanometers of visible light... Or the centimeters of microwaves, why the hot and cold spots in a microwave oven are centimeters apart and the food needs to be rotated. The black hole's radiation peaks at WAY longer wavelengths than the radio waves we can detect. That is obviously going to be a very very low temperature and something with a low temperature 3 miles across is going to radiate at a VERY low rate. So the rate of energy coming out through Hawking radiation is VERY slow.",1584054435,astrophysics,Schmucko,Astrophysics,Comment,303
8888,"**Black-body radiation**

Black-body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, emitted by a black body (an idealized opaque, non-reflective body).  It has a specific spectrum of wavelengths, inversely related to intensity that depend only on the body's temperature, which is assumed for the sake of calculations and theory to be uniform and constant.The thermal radiation spontaneously emitted by many ordinary objects can be approximated as black-body radiation.  A perfectly insulated enclosure that is in thermal equilibrium internally contains black-body radiation and will emit it through a hole made in its wall, provided the hole is small enough to have negligible effect upon the equilibrium.

A black body at room temperature appears black, as most of the energy it radiates is in the infrared spectrum and cannot be perceived by the human eye.

I started reading many popular astronomy books and saved my allowance for a small telescope, then when I was around 15 my parents drove me to the local planetarium quite often for talks, I started doing science fairs, went on to study physics and astrophysics, and have been doing research in astrophysics for the past 28 years... I still feel the same fascination as I did when I was 9.

So, OP: support her, show her that you think her interest is great, don't be disappointed if she develops a fascination for something else, but be with her, be somebody she can talk to and share her fascination and where she can bounce off her ideas. And bring her in contact with people who love astronomy - as I said in another post, there are many astronomy clubs pretty much everywhere, and many are extremely mixed by age and gender and typically they're very welcoming.",1584002332,astrophysics,velax1,Astrophysics,Comment,207
8897,"1) Observe the nightsky - this could be with your naked eye, a telescope, or a field trip to an observatory. Can you identify constellations and/or planets in the nightsky? What about without the use of mobile apps? Maybe you can check out a meteor shower (roughly one major one per month; more visibility during New Moon), or a lunar/solar eclipse. 

2) Introduce the topic of computer programming. It is a bit much to expect a 13-year old to write beautiful code that incorporates calculus. BUT, familiarizing oneself with a new language (especially before they get ""too old to learn"") will prove extremely useful later down the line (even if interests change at a later time).  One example is to use an open-source language (free and documented online) such as python - with which one can find [free tutorials online](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python), create [playable games like hangman](https://medium.com/@andrewyang96/coding-a-game-of-hangman-in-python-from-scratch-a538542e5c0c), or [do online math-based challenges](https://projecteuler.net/archives) (which become harder as one progresses). A lot of these skills - the ability to think and reason through a problem, create visualizations, etc - will prove useful later; some may make learning higher-level math (ie, linear algebra) easier at some future point. Maybe eventually, your step-daughter can even use python to [download NASA data](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nasa_exoplanet_archive/nasa_exoplanet_archive.html) and code her own analyses.

3) Aside from publication journals, are you aware that there are magazines (online and offline) that discuss the latest findings in astronomy? Many exist, but two that are relatively inexpensive are [Astronomy](https://astronomy.com/) and [Sky &amp; Telescope](https://skyandtelescope.org/).

4) NASA has their own TV channel. They feature interviews with ISS astronauts, discussions about the latest discoveries, etc. 

5) Kids are great at memorizing. Half of the world will laugh at you for thinking the world is flat. But if you asked that half to prove the Earth isn't flat, could they? The ancient Greeks proved that Earth was round without the use of satellite imagery and other modern tech. Thinking about the ""hows"" and ""whys"" (ie, how to think) is often more important than the regurgitation of memorized facts (ie, telling someone what to think). Make a game of it and pick [one paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paradoxes#Cosmology) per week/month and try to see how many ways you can resolve it.

6) See what topics are being discussed in the [stack exchange forums](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/). Some might be over the head of your average 13-year old, but others [may be a good fit](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/16/why-is-only-one-side-of-the-moon-visible-from-earth). (Also a good place to ask astronomy-related questions)

7) Richard Feynman was not an astrophysicist per se, but he probably could have been. Even if he does not talk about planets, his [monologues and discussions are illuminating](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiii9f6uJToAhUEWa0KHReEAl4QwqsBMAB6BAgMEAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZbFM3rn4ldo&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PAFFrilyovIRTCHr-sUno).

&amp;#x200B;

other things for science/ engineering, some astro/physics stuff, but for her age group generic science/math/ stem is great

* local astro club/ amature astronomy club might be great also i saw another poster
* find a python or generic programing camp / course(s) to take 
* science camps exist also?
* a telescope ($1000 ish for a good one) might be good to keep her interested up (inspiration stuff)
* get her the cosmos book by carl sagon, also watch the series (both versians, the old carl sagan one is on youtube) (this is more inspiration stuff), also astrophysics for ppl in a hurry, this sub could give a plethora of books to read, 
* encourage reading, learning outside the classroom
* I recall visiting a science museum and my dad reading to me a wrinkle in time when I was young and I never looked back, wrinkle in time might be pushing the age group
* encouragement goes a long way, I'm a male, but I'm aware that there are seldom few well known at least STEM role models that are females, I might find some, and point them out a lot so she feels inspired and can see herself as one
* they also generally have open science talk nights at local universities, worth emailing a physics proff or 2
* do science fair!!!
* get some diy science books to do, don't be afraid of circuit stuff also (super extra but absolutely wonderful bonding time , same with programing projects or ""science projects"" in general
* a nasa poster/ shirt helps out also
* Watch back to the future
* have science conversations / future conversations at the dinner table ( keep it hard fiction tho)
* I personally like science history stories also/ riddles. "" How do you think the first person calculated the circumference of the earth?"", ""Why is the night sky dark?"", 

If she wants to do STEM, in high school I would do the following (more for hard science or enginering)

* take as many math classes as you can (algebra, geometry, calc, more calc)
* programing classes if avaiable
* science classes, physics , and a astro class if they have it
* try to do IB/AP, or duel enrollment (if in america)
* do the science fair",1583992689,astrophysics,afinemax,Astrophysics,Comment,428

8928,"You already have the equation you need - it is equation 1 from the first paper you linked, on page 4. The equation shows a function I(r, theta) which gives the intensity/density of matter at every point in polar space.

If you just want to plot a single line for each arm, notice that the intensity is highest when gamma (defined as in equation 2) is 0, since then cos(gamma) will be 1. So the curve corresponding to a spiral arm can be found by solving for theta such that gamma=0 at each radius you plot. The result of this is just a logarithmic spiral: `theta(R) = theta_0 + (tan(p)^-1) * ln(R/R_0)`.

8930,"One reason you may not have an answer is because the problem is a little complicated. The spiral arms of the Milky Way are something of an illusion, in a sense. The structures are actually ""density waves"" formed by stars reaching the distant part of their orbit. Stars are moving slower at that point in their orbits so they kind of ""pile up"" and make it look like there's a structure there. (This video illustrates it fairly well: https://youtu.be/c5Us-jonCLA. You might also want this video for a better explanation: https://youtu.be/aIUu5uMKB70. A more technical description is here: https://youtu.be/wIkOu45PHdA.) 


To properly graph such a thing requires somewhat complicated equations so it isn't a matter of a single equation.


All of that said, perhaps you could just graph two or three spirals using spiral coordinates? r=θ will give you a spiral and you can just multiply θ by any number to make it wind tighter or less tightly... I know that isn't ideal but it might work 🤷‍♂️

We cannot directly observe a black hole. We now that they are in the center of jets and really powerful astrophysical events, and in some cases of supermassive ones we can infer their location due to their gravitational effect on the orbits of nearby stars, but we cannot directly see a black hole.

8946,"Okay well there's a few things I think you gotta take into consideration. 

 1. A black hole close enough to a star would be pulling in the stars matter, creating around it an accretion disk which is this disk of very hot dust and gas spiralling around the blackhole to eventually fall into it. All this dust and gas would make it hard to actually view the blackhole in anyway. 

2. Gravitational lensing. A blackhole would have a mass great enough to distort the space time around it so the space around the black hole will seem distorted and youd be able to see objects even directly behind the black hole as it's light is bent around it. I believe someone's already dropped a link to a simulation. This same gravitational effect can in theory project the accretion disk over the black hole like seen in interstellar, I think that's pretty cool. 

3. It's escape velocity is the speed of light so any light that falls into it is completely absorbed. It doesnt emit any light either. So it can't really cast shadows in the typical sense, gravitational lensing and all,  but Im no expert I can't really tell ya.  

I think the most accurate and coolest way to depict it would be to depict a dormant blackhole distorting the spacetime behind it..or a blackhole eating up a giant star with an accretion disk around it. I suggest you look up artists impressions.

8951,"I decided to write up some maths for you to help calculate what you want.

First lets introduce the concept of solid angle (measured in sr). It's basically a way of measuring how much of the sky is occupied by an object. The moon occupies about 6E-5 sr, for example.

Given what you know about solar eclipses, what do you think the solid angle of the sun is in the sky? (Ans: about the same)

Now on to the maths. The solid angle occupied by the black hole is given by:

    solid_angle_BH = Area_BH/distance_BH^2 = (pi r_BH^2) / d_BH^2
The Schwarzschild radius of the black hole (how big the black bit is), is given by:

    schw-R_BH = 2 G M_BH/c^2

So substituting the radius equation into the solid angle equation gives us the solid angle occupied as a function of mass:
    
    solid_angle_BH = (pi (2 G M_BH/c^2 )^2 )/d_BH^2
    
Now the force you feel between yourself and the black hole is given by:

    F_BH = G M_BH m_person/d_BH^2
    
And the force between you and the planet you're standing on by:

    F_planet = G M_planet m_person/d_planet^2
    
So in the critical scenario where the force you feel between yourself and the black hole is equal to the force you feel down to the planet (basically 0 g feeling) is when the two forces are equal:

    G M_planet m_person/d_planet^2 = G M_BH m_person/d_BH^2
    

So the distance to the black hole in this critical scenario is given by the equation below. If the black hole was any closer, you'd start to fall towards it.
    
    d_BH = sqrt(M_BH d_planet^2 /M_planet) = d_planet sqrt(M_BH/M_planet)

So substituting the above into our solid angle formula gives us

    maximum_solid_angle_BH = (pi r_BH^2) / d_BH^2 

    maximum_solid_angle_BH = (pi (2 G M_BH/c^2 )^2 ) / (d_planet sqrt(M_BH/M_planet))^2

Simplifying:

    maximum_solid_angle_BH = (4 pi G^2 / c^4) * (M_BH * m_planet / d_planet^2 ) 

The above is the equation for the maximum solid angle of a black hole in the sky you can get before you start to fall towards it. It depends on the mass of your planet and it's radius (d_planet), in addition to the mass of the black hole.

For the smallest observed black hole mass (3.8 solar masses) and the mass and size of Earth, the maximum solid angle we'd get before disaster is 8E-12 sr, so about 7.5 million times smaller than the moon. 

This may seem small, but from what a quick google tells me it's about 500x larger than Betelgeuse in the night sky (a star in the belt of orion). So it'd be able to occlude a star.

8952,"&gt;  Is that gif an accelerated simulation? 

It is a simulation as the image title says. Whether it is accelerated or not depends on how fast the observer or/and the black hole moves, and how far the observer is from the black hole. If you have a black hole that is close enough to the Earth (or the solar system) then the motion of Earth and/ or the black hole might cause sky distortions to happen on much smaller timescales (weeks or months or years, depending on how close it is).

8975,"True, but how does that disprove my original statement? The computing power of any computer is limited by its total computational capacity defined by the capacities of its components. These capacities have been steadily increasing since the invention of the computer, thus allowing the computation of more and more complex mathematical problems to be done more and more efficiently. Aside from that, a computer can be specialized to compute different types of mathematical problems. For example, a quantum computer will always be better at computing the exponential nature of quantum algorithms than a classical computer ever could. They are both a type of computer, but they're not the same, they operate on 2 very different architectures. They are both devices designed to compute, but they're not the same. A computer is a *type* of computational machine, a classical computer or a quantum computer are a *sub-type* of a computer. A computer and a ***quantum*** computer are not the same thing - removing the word quantum would simply make it a computer, which could mean either a quantum computer or a classical computer (or other). Much like a Turing machine is not a computer - a computer and a Turing machine are both just sub-types of a computational machine.

So when I say ""computer-like"", I don't mean it's not a computer. It is, as another sub-type of a computer. A computer with an architecture designed specifically to handle mathematical tasks required to efficiently simulate a Universe and all of its laws, such as effective computation of irrational numbers.

It is true that technically, you could explain the entirety of the Universe and all of its phenomena through an extremely complex set of boolean gates and other programming logic. However, no present-day computer would be even remotely close to being powerful enough to simulate an entire Universe with all of its laws and intricacies. Therefore, I'll be assuming that it's running on something that's merely computer-like - a computer merely being the closest thing that we know of today to what the Universe would actually be running on.

When you're playing a video game, in order to save computing resources, the game unloads most of the things (at least as far as the graphics go) that are not currently in view (e.g. behind you), and/or too far away to have any feasible effect in the area you're located in. Let's take NPCs as an example. When you look at an area containing NPCs again after it's been unloaded for some time, the game will either A) Create brand new versions of the NPCs in their defaults, B) Load their states from memory, or C) Actually calculate approximates of how the NPCs' positions and states could have changed in the time you were not present, and then put them there. You could argue that the simulation hypothesis uses option C). The simulation runs everything as approximates (and the further away the elements are from a conscious observer, the more approximate they become (to the point where things not being observed at all ""cease to exist""), ~~which could then imply that the best way to search for intelligent alien life is to look for regions of the Universe that have an unusually high rate of observational accuracy~~, and only makes them ""real"" and assigns concrete values to them when they are measured. You could compare this to quantum mechanics - for instance, the exact location of an electron in an atom of hydrogen exists in many different positions (the likelihood of any of the possible positions being a probability amplitude), until you observe it (collapse the superposition) and ""force"" the electron to be in one of the possible locations. However, there is no way to prove this, and therefore it remains in the area of philosophy, as you could compare this to the question of ""If a tree falls in a forest and there's noone around to hear it, does it make a sound?""

This comment is getting long, so I'll just quickly go over 2 more things that the simulation hypothesis can't actually really answer, thus making it unlikely:

1. A simulation can only exist if it has a reason. A simulation doesn't just happen. You consciously design a simulation either because you want to study something, or even just purely for entertainment. What is the purpose of simulating our Universe?
2. If our Universe was, in fact, a simulation, it would be logical to assume that the Universe in which the simulation of our Universe exists in, is itself a simulation. This creates a recursive loop. Where does this cycle of nested simulations end? Does it even have an end, or is it infinite? If it's infinite, when/where/why/how did it start? Is it also possible to assume that due to the law of diminishing returns, every subsequent simulation is less accurate to the original one (like a game of Telephone), either because the simulation designers forgot to (or couldn't) properly program in some of their Universe's properties, or because they simply don't have enough computational resources within their simulation to make something as accurate as their own Universe? What would happen if the ""computer"" on which one of these simulations is running on breaks? Does everything from that point of the chain cease to exist, or does everything just get suspended in time, until the machine is repaired and the simulation continues as if nothing happened?",1583753832,astrophysics,MrPatko0770,Astrophysics,Comment,742

In the 1760s, Johann Heinrich Lambert proved that the number π (pi) is irrational: that is, it cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a is an integer and b is a non-zero integer. In the 19th century, Charles Hermite found a proof that requires no prerequisite knowledge beyond basic calculus. Three simplifications of Hermite's proof are due to Mary Cartwright, Ivan Niven, and Nicolas Bourbaki. Another proof, which is a simplification of Lambert's proof, is due to Miklós Laczkovich.

I agree that's possible. However, then the simulation would exist with the sole purpose of fooling humanity. The question then becomes the age old question: ""How do we know we can know something about the world?"" Which is purely philosophical and not that interesting to me.

I guess I interpreted OPs question more along the lines of ""Do we live in a universe that is easily simulated?"".

9020,"Hi there.  Best of luck with your search.  Here's a few ideas and some tips to consider:

Schools:

Northern Arizona University has a great program, and they're affiliated with the Lowell Observatory, where Pluto was discovered.  Many of their grad students do lectures for the public at night, so they have a great engagement. Flagstaff is a low-light city in Northern Arizona, so you can get amazing night viewings. 

University of Hawaii has a strong planetary sciences program.  They have great technology, and a giant new telescope was just built on the big island.

University of Delaware has a good program too.  I know someone in the graduate astrophysics program that has the freedom to study atypical programs, where when he was at Princeton it was all classic astrophysics.

Johns Hopkins University has a great program, but it's very exclusive and you need to go into the application process knowing exactly what you want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Tips:

1) Look at the faculty - see what their research areas are and choose a program whose faculty aligns with what you want to study.  It would really suck to get into a school and find out that your interests aren't shared by your advisors. Are there a lot of post-docs?  A lot of full-time faculty?    
2) Look at the facilities and region.  Northern Arizona University is a great program, but Flagstaff is at the base of the rocky mountains, and when I was there this past thanksgiving, it was 10 degrees (and that was in november).  Likewise, a program like Johns Hopkins is based in a city, so expect to be dealing with urban living, higher costs, etc.

3) See where there grads go.  If you're looking to teach, look for a program that emphasizes teaching, whereas others might emphasize research.  See what kind of financial aid is offered, where their grads get placed, do they get jobs, etc.  Look beyond the program and see where it could put you.

Yep, that's it

&gt; that would allow it to strike the star in that time period, right?

If you're letting the object accelerate, then the only limit on its speed is the speed of light. If you just wanted to let gravity do the work, it would take [about 25 years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%28%2826+AU%29**3+%2F+%28G+*+7+*+mass+of+sun%29%29*pi) for the object to fall into the sun (you can play around with the '52' if you want to try different distances). So 500 km/s is very fast for stellar systems, but not explicitly impossible; the fastest stars we observe in the Milky Way have roughly this speed.

&gt; the alien object contains a neutron star

This sounds fun. Have you head of [strange stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_star) and [strange matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_matter)? They could be good handwavium in your scenario.

&gt; So, you're saying the radio emissions themselves probably wouldn't be harmful to a person unless you were to be in the direct path of the beam

I'm afraid I'm really not an expert on this, but that seems pretty likely to me

&gt; Also, when you say their black-body emissions, do you mean the pulsar itself

Yes, I mean the entire pulsar - the whole surface will be very hot. I'm not sure whether the poles would be significantly hotter or cooler. By the way, [the pulsar's beams are not necessarily aligned with its rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar#/media/File:Pulsar_schematic.svg). If they were, it wouldn't appear to pulse.

As an aside, if you were looking for a way for the object to be noticed in the first place, one of the things we can measure when observing a pulsar is the velocity of its orbit (if it has a companion - in your case, eta Hyd). Your scenario would look strange to an observer because the 'pulsar' would be moving, but its host star would not",1583449766,astrophysics,xilefakamot,Astrophysics,Comment,322

Okay, so it would need to be roughly 7.7 billion km (141,000,000 * 52) from the star in order to have the same brightness as the Earth, correct? This works perfectly for me. Eta Hydrae is only 4 times the radius of the sun, so it'd be 13 times smaller at that distance, I think.

And yeah, I guess I did mean eccentric orbit rather than retrograde. The object would act pretty similar to the sungrazing comets described. Also, it can adjust its own speed, or it at least has pre-existing momentum, so that would allow it to strike the star in that time period, right? It would have be moving pretty quickly relative to the star - if my math is right, something like 509 km/s. (distance of 7.7 billion km, 175 days (or 15,120,000 seconds)). On an astronomical scale, that's not too impossible, right?

To be honest, I probably won't even really get into the details of the above math in the story, I just wanted to be certain that it was feasible.

As far as the neutron star stuff goes, I probably should've noted one of the conceits of the story - the alien object contains a neutron star inside it. I know this is practically impossible for at least a dozen reasons, but one of the themes I'm trying to get across is that the alien technology is so far beyond our own that it's basically incomprehensible. I liked the idea that these aliens were so advanced that they could harness this incredibly exotic and dangerous object.

So, the pulsar has had (in some way) its radiation, gravitational, and magnetic effects shielded or contained. But, the radio emissions are still present. The scientists detect the radio emissions and (at first) think they may actually be some kind of communication. Hence my weird questions about what the radio emissions are like! 

So, you're saying the radio emissions themselves probably wouldn't be harmful to a person unless you were to be in the direct path of the beam, right? Also, when you say their black-body emissions, do you mean the pulsar itself, or the emissions coming off the pulsar's poles?",1583448168,astrophysics,momentary_mango,Astrophysics,Comment,400

9044,"Both preceding answers are fine.  


&gt;My last question involves pulsars - specifically, their radio wave  output. I'm really just hoping to get some more general information on  this subject. As these are radio waves, do they have a sound?

Not intrinsically, no; radio wave frequencies are on the order of gigahertz', our hearing is capped at about 20 kilohertz, give or take.  IOW, the ""vibration"" of a radio wave needs to be scaled to a proper band, and like u/xilefakamot explained, converted to pressure fluctuations for our ears to detect them.  


You don't ""hear radiowaves"" from a radio, either, the audible signal has been encoded into the radio transmission; in layman terms, you could say ""the audio rides the radiowave"", or something like that.    


Also, pulsars generally don't emit in just radio frequencies, but in [everything from radio to x-rays and even gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum).    


&gt;Lastly, are they benign

In my mind, benign would be the last descriptor I would attach to a neutron star, ie. pulsar.  They're extreme pretty much regardless of what aspect one concentrates on.  Cool from afar, tho.",1583442440,astrophysics,ketarax,Astrophysics,Comment,180

.",1583441158,astrophysics,ketarax,Astrophysics,Comment,31
9046,"&gt; Or is the relationship between luminosity and distance not linear?

It's not linear; the flux drops proportionally to the square of the distance. You only need to be at 52 times the Earth's distance to get the same brightness

&gt; One key plot point involves the object being in a steeply retrograde orbit. Specifically, it's going to hit the star in less than 6 months

 There's nothing inherently unstable about retrograde orbits. Perhaps you mean a very *eccentric* orbit? Objects in these kinds of orbit exist - see [sungrazing comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungrazing_comet).

&gt; With the distances involved in the first question, is this even possible? 

The problem is that orbits are periodic; in order to hit the star, it must have been launched from the star's surface in the past. You can get around this if you allow the object to adjust its own speed (or also have it collide with something - but this is both unlikely and will probably destroy it)

&gt;As these are radio waves, do they have a sound?

If you define sound as a vibration of air, then pulsars (unsurprisingly) don't make sound. You can make an analogy between EM field strength and pressure, which is how people make those 'sounds of space objects' clips.

&gt; If so, what do they sound like? Is it just uniform white noise?

I believe that the emission is pretty close to white noise, but as is propagates through space, it gets distorted so that the frequency generally [sweeps down over the course of the pulse](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/x324.png) (think of a 'pew pew' sound). This won't be noticeable if you're close to the pulsar

&gt; Do they give off light as well, or are they confined to the Radio portion of the spectrum?

Yes, they do, but the peak of their black-body emission is usually in the UV to X-rays

&gt; Lastly, are they benign?

If you're extremely close (100s to 1000s of km), there will be interesting magnetic effects that are probably bad for you; if you're quite close (up to ~10^6 km), you're liable to be tidally shredded; beyond this, your main risk is probably the flux of high-energy radiation, which will drop off with the square of the distance, as above. I haven't done any detailed calculations, but I think you'd probably be fine beyond 10^(8)s of km. I'm not sure what the effects of the radio emission would be, but you only have to worry about this if you're in the path of the beam, which is very narrow",1583438781,astrophysics,xilefakamot,Astrophysics,Comment,421

He should like to have a star chart (built over the history of astronomy of said planet), especially if the planet moves a lot on the sky from night to night.  On at least two, preferrably three or more, subsequent observing sessions, appropriately (need more info to get more exact) spaced in time, he would sketch the target planets position with respect to the background stars.

However this is not some magic quantity - it’s determined by things like the weight of the rocket, how much fuel is left, engine efficiency, etc. Adding more mass (like attaching a payload) will *change* the delta-v of that rocket. For instance, a rocket which can change its own speed by 10m/s will no long be able to do so if you put a heavy payload on it.  The delta-v will go down, because the object (rocket+payload) is now harder to move. 

To use your Up example - each ballon might have a certain delta-v on its own, but when attached to the house you will have to recalculate the delta-v to consider the whole object, which is now the house + the balloon.

9077,"I wish I had time to do a write up right now on it, but unfortunately I don't (maybe someone else on the subreddit can go into more detail?).

When you move away from someone at high velocity (like 50% the speed of light velocity), you actually observe that time moves slower for that other person. Similarly, that other person observes that time moves slower for you as well. The reason is due to relativity. I realize that is a really unsatisfying answer, but the whole explanation of what's going on is lengthy, I suggest you look it up if you're interested. Essentially, it is taking longer and longer for events to be perceived by each person as they move further away from each other because the light being emitted from one another is taking longer to reach the other party, thus they perceive each other's time slowing down. 

On the other hand, if they are moving towards each other they perceive time to be speeding up. Events are being compressed. 

Here is the twin paradox: on an outbound journey, the twin on Earth is stationary (relatively). The twin on the rocket moves away at some significant percentage the speed of light, during which it seems that time is slowing for that twin. Then the twin turns around at a nearby star and comes back, during which time seems to be moving faster. If the distance from Earth to the star is constant, and the velocity of the rocketship is constant, then the slowing of time on the outbound leg must equal the hastening of time on the inbound leg. Thus, the twins should be the same age when the rocket twin gets back to Earth right?

Well actually if you do the math, you'll find that the rocket twin is younger than the Earth twin. The reason is because at some point the rocket twin had to decelerate, turn around and accelerate at the star. It is during this period of non-constant velocity that the twin on Earth ages faster relative to the rocket twin. 

It is tough to show why this happens without diagrams (tbh, I don't entirely understand it myself). But hopefully this sheds a little light on your original question. 

The reason why it's not time travel is because as the other commenter said, ""time-travel"" is usually meant to mean I am going from one point in time to another point in time (e.g. 1985 to 1955). But this is NOT what happens in relativity. The time slowing and speeding (called time dilation) is caused by relativity, not a ""time travel"" mechanism. 

Side note, once you actually start to look into it, it turns out that faster than light travel is actually the same as time travel and the reason why you can't travel faster than light is because it would imply you are traveling through time, which would imply that you can cause a paradox, thus time travel is impossible, thus faster than light travel is impossible. But that's a whole other can of worms.",1583356938,astrophysics,RUacronym,Astrophysics,Comment,510

9083,"Hi! If you mean that it would 'throw us forward' as if something with the speed of '568,000 mph' had just 'broken uniform motion', then I don't think this is the case. Because it's all relative speeds, the asteroid is also traveling at '500,000 mph' (as you state) around the galaxy to someone fixed outside the solar system. The 'delta in energy', from my understanding, would just be energy caused by objects colliding with momentum that equates to the 67,000 mph revolution around the sun vs the asteroids own momentum around the sun. The rest of the momentum related to all that extra motion would cancel out. So the humans on Earth (us) need only worry about the physics of the collision of the bodies traveling with speeds relative to the sun, and not all else. 

Just as when a car collides with another on earth, only the relative motions of the cars matter, not the fact that the Earth's rotation of 1000 mph impacts how your 'lurch forward' (and thankfully not the 67000 mph motion of the Earth around the sun, or the 500,000 of the Earth around the galaxy.

Also your 'motion of a human being moving at 568,000 mph' is likely a bit different to the observer in reality, as the epicycle of a human is his 'circle of motion' around the center of Earth, and the deferent of that is the huge circle around the sun, which is yet another epicycle for the sun around the galaxy (which may then transcribe in some further motion of the galaxy around the universe, and the universe around something else). Since a lot of these motions are 'circular', a human being's 'speed' relative to an observer outside the galaxy would likely focus on more of the motion of the solar system around the galaxy rather than the individual angular motions.

I do want to clarify that I didn't compute any momenta (and that calculation would be enormous I'm sure, dealing with angular momentum, the moment of inertia of the human around the earth, the earth around the sun, the sun around the galaxy, and the collision of the asteroid with respect to all these parameters as well) - but I feel a lot of things would cancel out, and the human would feel the relative motions and collisions of what I wrote above.

In particle physics, a massless particle is an elementary particle whose invariant mass is zero.

Negative energy is a concept used in physics to explain the nature of certain fields, including the gravitational field and various quantum field effects.

In more speculative theories, negative energy is involved in wormholes which may allow for time travel and warp drives for faster-than-light space travel.

9139,"98 and still pondering deep questions about the universe, hope I'm doing that well at 98!


1) neutrinos do actually have mass it's just very tiny so we can sometimes consider them similar to massless particles (in the sense they are considered ""relativistic"", at least as far as astrophysicists are concerned don't try tell a particle physicist that :P)

Regardless even light (which is massless) cannot escape a black hole if it passes too close (within what we call the ""event horizon"")

To understand this we need to know what Einstein taught us about gravity in his theory of general relativity.

Basically he said mass bends space time around massive objects. For example the moon thinks it's going ""in a straight line"" around the Earth because the space is bent around in Earth and straight lines with it.

You can consider a heavy mass on a stretched sheet of rubber as a 2D analogy.

Black holes bend spacetime so much that (within the event horizon) there is no possible path through space time anything can take to get out. 

2) this is a tricky one because dark energy and dark matter are poorly understood.

Dark matter is the simpler of the two, it is merely normal matter that only reacts through gravity (ie doesn't interact with light so we call it ""dark"" how inventive). I'm pretty sure the amount of dark matter in the universe is pretty much fixed (although others here may inform us otherwise).

Dark energy is the name we give to the energy that drives the accelerating expansion of the universe. We are totally clueless about this one although typically most people think it is ""vacuum energy"" or the energy of empty space.

The expansion of the universe is pretty crazy since space isn't actually stretching, but rather there is more of it being created (this is why there is no centre of the universe).

As more space is created there's more ""vacuum energy"" ie dark energy and so it looks like the size of the universe is going to keep expanding faster and faster forever.

3) anti matter is like normal matter but all the chargers are swapped. So, for example, the anti matter equivalent of an electron is a ""positron"" which has the same mass but a positive charge rather than a negative charge.

Energy is energy it can take different forms (kinetic, electrical, potential, etc) and is defined most simplest as the ability to do ""work"". As such it doesn't really make sense to have an ""anti-energy"" 

However when a particle and and anti particle come together they completely cancel out and are turned into pure energy via Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2

9143,"1. Neutrinos actually aren't massless, they just have such a small mass that we can't actually measure it (we can constrain its upper bounds though).

We know from general relativity that gravity isn't just some force that pulls masses together, it's the curvature of spacetime. Because it's the curvature of spacetime, it applies to everything that exists within said spacetime regardless of whether or not it has mass, this includes light which we see being bent by gravity in ""gravitational lensing"". Inside a black hole, spacetime is warped so much that all possible paths through it end up at the singularity (the centre) of the black hole, including all the neutrinos and all the light.

9267,"Atoms are broken down long before a black hole occurs.

A star that's not massive enough to collapse into a black hole can collapse into a neutron star. As its name implies, a neutron star is composed mostly of neutrons.

The reason for that is, simply put, the gravitational force squashes the electrons into the nucleus of their atoms, where they combine with protons to form neutrons.  The resulting substance is known, somewhat informally, as [neutronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutronium).

When a black hole forms, the matter becomes even more dense, which implies that even the structure of neutrons will become compromised. Neutrons (and protons) are composed of quarks and gluons, so one possibility is that it would collapse to a [quark star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_star), although we have no evidence of the existence of these. 

Even if quark stars don't exist as long-lived objects, there's likely to be a phase during the collapse to a black hole where the neutron structure is destroyed and replaced by hot, dense quark matter. 

But once the black hole actually forms, exactly what happens inside the event horizon is simply unknown. None of our theories produce reliable enough predictions for us to answer questions about this with any confidence. This is one reason why there's a great deal of interest in finding a general theory of quantum gravity, which unifies general relativity and quantum physics - because it could help us answer questions like this.",1582423568,astrophysics,antonivs,Astrophysics,Comment,235

9269,"There are a few layers here. One important one, which may be a bit semantic but important to explicitly state nonetheless, is that atoms are not the base units. We can break them down into electrons and protons, and we can break protons down into quarks. That doesn’t change the substance of your question, and the unsatisfying answer is that we simply don’t know. We have lots of theories and conjectures, and if you follow general relativity down its own rabbit hole then you get to exactly what you described: an infinitely dense point into which things merge and lose all individual identity and ability to influence the external universe. However, general relativity is known to be incomplete, and the idea of such a singularity doesn’t mesh with our understanding of quantum, so we can’t assume that this is the absolute truth even though it was largely general relativity that led us to black holes. We need a working quantum theory of gravity before we can make that much more progress. We are perfectly okay with the idea of all matter being smushed to the extent that atoms, protons, and neutrons, all break down into quarks and form a sort of superliquid plasma. We’ve made that in the lab, and it is very likely to be what makes up the cores of neutron stars. Once we get beyond that state of matter/those density levels, we start running out of steam though. 

As far as the information paradox goes, that’s a little bit more complicated. Its foundations are in quantum. I’m not going to go into fine details here - I can in a follow up if you want - but basically, the way that quantum systems evolves requires information to be conserved (some people argue that gravity changes this and therefore this presents no problem, but again, we don’t have a theory of quantum gravity). With black holes, we have an apparent lack of conservation of information. Anything that enters it carries information, and upon entering it, it ostensibly loses all causal connection with the universe. Some people, including big names, simply don’t care. They say this is perfectly okay, but a lot of others hate it. Where is this information? Does it still exist? Can it ever be accessed? We don’t know. Some say Hawking radiation may carry information about what’s in the black hole. Others say the information is simply tucked away inside the black hole and will be released at its death. There are other, more exotic and less understandable proposed solutions too. There was a claim of a resolution last year, and it doesn’t appear to be obviously, so it’ll be interesting to see where that goes. Maybe once we have a working quantum theory of gravity and a better grasp on the inner workings of black holes, the resolution will present itself.",1582423134,astrophysics,greenwizardneedsfood,Astrophysics,Comment,477

Oh they go together all right, but your wording was ""spacetime consists of gravitational waves"".  Do you think water consists of water waves, or is it the other way round?  If you ""calmed down"" a subspace such that there were no gravitational waves passing through, would that mean that subspacetime ceased to 'exist'?  


So no, I don't think gravitational waves \*are\* the fabric of spacetime.  Rather, the fabric -- if anything -- is fundamental, and gravitational waves just ride upon it.   


&gt;Then I said ""special time"" and ""special space"" not ""special spacetime""

That's not an improvement.  Old [Nikolaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle) is throwing rocks at you, [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity) fuming beside him.   


&gt;And also can explain me why cannot it move in every direction?

I'm not sure that I can!  That's *such* an out-of-bounds idea to me.  All points of space moving in every direction?  Perhaps this is a language issue, and you only mean to speak of the usual expansion, where distances are increasing.  Regardless, you would be fun to party with ...

I'm sorry, but I don't think you have a clue what you're talking about.  And/or you wouldn't understand me about those either.  Those are story devices for you, but mathematics(\*) to me (even though 'spherical tesseract' sounds novel to me, I can think of several solutions or objects that would be at least conceptually in the right ballpark; I'll bring up the ""[nested spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_coordinates)"" of the Schwarzschild solution as an example that is too delicious to leave out with wormholes on the table already and all).    


And now that you perhaps got a new name for your spherical tesseract, I should warn you that it is NOT what you wrote about.

(\*) Mathematics, see, not physics, even.  I don't treat wormholes as real at all, they are not ""doors"" or necessary ingredient of a cosmos to me, not yet at least.   


&gt;I'm not a student, I'm just a forensics student, I suck at maths and never studied astrophysics 🤷🏻‍♂️ so... I'm really a laypeople,

It took me a while to realize that I just needed a bit more time to understand things as I think a lot deeper than most people do (my teachers / parents / friends didn't realize this as I thought more and differently than they did). Being an introvert I never realized it during undergrad and silently suffered through it. It was later during grad school that I finally realized this as I saw others struggling with things which seemed natural to me because I was thinking about those things in undergrad / high school.

Not sure if I was educated in the same country as you are but here are my two cents. My advice for your son would be to stick to doing things he wants to do and loves to do. Ask him to consider the low grades as roadblocks or stepping stones to reach his dream goal. Everyone is different and has different ways to think and work through things.

9426,"Oh.  I'm sorry.  Take it easy.  


Your answer, then.  


&gt;I say, why can't there be a big crunch.

Presently, it's because the observations indicate the cosmos is undergoing an accelerating metric expansion, which means the energy density of the cosmos is not sufficient to reverse the expansion into a collapse (via gravitation).   


&gt; It's our perspective that is giving us wrong data (that galaxies are spreading apart faster from eachother).

There's nothing special about our perspective.  Not that we know of, at least.

&gt;When the dynamite blows up (the big bang) your little sand grain goes from 0 meters per second to 1 meter per second. 

OK.

&gt;The 1/2 second later as the explosion is happening we go from 1 meter a second to 2 meter a second.

No.  Your grains of sand come equipped with a rocket engine or some such now.  The grains were accelerated by the explosion; they will only slow down from there.   


If it seems to you that the grains are speeding up, they either have propulsion, or there's metric expansion in the picture.   The latter doesn't increase the kinetic energy, therefore velocity, of the particles; but it makes it appear as if it did.   


&gt;From our perspective all the other sand grains are speeding up from eachother and we assume we will just keep speeding up from eachother. When in reality the bang technically is still pushing out until it's over and we slow to a stop.

Only if our point of reference was a special place for the big bang; this goes against the [Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle) (""common sense"" in physics/cosmology).   


&gt;Could it be that our perspective is fooling us and there will be a big crunch in the future?

Yes, if our model of cosmos is (somewhat seriously) flawed.  Which is completely possible.  


&gt;We are just in an infant galaxy still forming.

This is possibly true in some relative sense, but as far as comparing to the galaxies that we see, ours seems to be much like the bulk of 'em; about the same age as the universe, and well-evolved for a remote-ish concentration of matter.  This means we're in a large [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy); if ours was a more crowded corner of the cosmos, we might've merged with large neighboring galaxies and find ourselves in an [elliptical galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy).",1581849469,astrophysics,ketarax,Astrophysics,Comment,384

Our cosmology is known to be extremely incomplete though, so everything is always subject to change, but that’s not what our current models suggest.

However, string/M theory and loop quantum gravity, two of the main quantum gravity theories, would change things if one of them turns out to be true. M theory allows extra dimensions and therefore lets multiple 3+1 d universes exist simultaneously. Loop quantum gravity allows big bounces (bang to crunch to bang) to happen infinitely many times, i.e. an infinite number of sequential universes. There are issues with both of those theories. It may very well turn out that they are both wrong, and even if one is right, we aren’t really sure of a good way to test them, but either of them would allow more things to exist/more big bangs - be it now or in the future - than this single present universe.

9437,"There is no evidence that gives a strong indication that the Big Crunch will happen. A Big Crunch requires a universe that is dense enough to overcome “normal” expansion and expansion due to a positive cosmological constant, if one is present (which we strongly believe to be the case). With a non-negative cosmological constant, this requires densities above the critical density (positive curvature). Using many independent methods, we observe a universe at almost exactly the critical density and a positive cosmological constant. In such a universe, gravity is not strong enough to overcome expansion, and the fate of the universe is more or less governed by the cosmological constant. Namely, infinite and accelerating expansion. We can easily construct a hypothetical universe where a Big Crunch happens, but there is not evidence to support that our universe has the necessary parameters, and in fact there is substantial evidence to the contrary. 

Your example is not valid. Disregarding the fact that we are in a fairly mature galaxy and that there are galaxies significantly younger than our solar system, the Big Bang isn’t something that is still pushing us or anything like that, nor should you think of it as an explosion in space. It’s not a stick of dynamite in the sand. It is simply the earliest moment to which our current understanding of physics can bring us when we extrapolate backwards, and therefore the earliest moment at which we can fairly confidently claim expansion was occurring (since getting from there to now requires expansion). We think that inflation happened shortly afterwards, and while it seems to be about as extreme of an event as we can imagine, even that was just a period of enormously quick expansion *of* space that significantly and rapidly changed the geometric properties of space. That’s all expansion is. Geometry changes over time, which makes distant objects appear to move away from us. Following inflation, the universe continued to expand in what you can more or less think of as a product of inertia. There simply wasn’t anything to stop it, even though it lost its main driver (inflation). Gravity was fighting it the entire time, but it simply couldn’t win. If it had won then we would see a Big Crunch (it may have already happened by now). Our positive cosmological constant is now driving accelerated expansion, and while it took some time for its effects to be significant, we have absolutely no reason to think that it will turn off at some point, and it seems to be the case that it will ultimately become the dominant factor in the universe. Furthermore, the gravity in our universe that would cause contraction isn’t some external field like in your example (Earth’s), it’s the gravitational interactions between the bodies in our universe, or, in your case, the mutual gravity of all of the sand. That means a collapse would require the attraction between the grains to overcome their motion. Absent the Earth’s gravity, normal sand moving away from an explosion would not do that. You also need to realize that expansion is really only important for things that aren’t gravitationally bound, so a solar system is not a valid grain of sand (unless it somehow wound up in a void).

It’s generally not a good idea to try an apply such simplistic and everyday examples as a way to understand general relativity and cosmology. These topics are just so out of our experience and intuition that any analogy will almost certainly be fundamentally flawed and leave you more confused than ever. 

You are absolutely correct that general relativity *allows* a Big Crunch, but it doesn’t *necessitate* one any more than it necessitates a Big Rip. We believe what we observe, and through many different methods, backed up by rigorous theory, we observe a universe that will not end in a crunch.

9438,"There's a relatively new concept called dark energy that acts as sort of the antithesis of gravity, causing the expansion of the universe to *accelerate*. The Hubble constant is a prime indicator of this (which has a significant discrepancy in values to begin with, \~67 or \~73 km/s/MPc), showing that the farther away you look from any point in space, the faster the expansion seems to be where you're looking at. This is because as the baryonic and dark matter density goes down as the universe expands, dark energy doesn't. It seems like its an energy intrinsic to the creation or expansion of space itself.

So, most evidence so far points to the opposite to your thoughts. Not a big crunch, but a big rip. After a certain point, the transfer of gravitational information between two points will become so large, baryonic matter will be unable to retain form, and will break into their most elementary components (Currently quarks).

9483,"You're confusing two different concepts.

Night and day are determined by the rotation of the planets, but that does not affect the actual passage of time.

Time dilation is caused by gravity, and is completely independent of rotation. If the Earth spun ten times faster and a day lasted 2.4 hours, the time dilation would be exactly the same. Time dilation changes the speed at which the universe runs, but it's tied only to the amount of mass present - the ""weight"" of the gravitating object.  
Gravity is stronger the closer you get to the source of it, so in regions close to extremely massive (heavy) objects like dense stars and black holes, time runs noticeably slower

Earth weighs a metric shit-tonne, causing enough gravity to gently clamp us to the surface, but that's nowhere near enough gravity to cause noticeable time dilation. The gravity on the Sun's surface is about 25 times stronger than what you're feeling right now, but we would need to dial that up to hundreds or thousands of times that gravity to dilate time.

The spinning of a planet only controls how *much* time passes every day - the *length* of time between the start of one day and the next.  
Time dilation controls how *quickly* that time passes.  
That said, whether dilated or not, you would experience time the same way. You will only notice time dilatation if you can compare the speed of events unfolding in your own region to those in another. 

This is why we know that things falling into a black hole will appear to slow down - as they fall into more and more dilated space, they have less and less *time* to *do* their falling in.",1581640629,astrophysics,Destructor1701,Astrophysics,Comment,288

9492,"Under 'normal' conditions time dilation is so incredibly small as to not matter. We can actually look at the calculations to see how significant it is. In the equations of special relativity, which govern time dilation due to different motion/reference frames, there's a value called 'gamma', which in time dilation is the ratio of measured rates of time between two frames. If gamma is 1, then they have the same rate of passage of time; if it's greater than one then there is a difference in how time would be observed between the two reference frames.

So let's calculate some gamma values. The Earth orbits the Sun at about 30 km/s. Compared to a frame at rest relative to the Sun, the [gamma factor](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2Fsqrt%281-%28orbital+velocity+of+Earth%29%5E2%2Fc%5E2%29) is 1.0000000049, or about 5 parts per billion different.

For a more distant and more slowly moving (dwarf) planet, like Pluto, this difference drops to [0.1 parts per billion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2Fsqrt%281-%28orbital+velocity+of+pluto%29%5E2%2Fc%5E2%29-1) (note that in that equation I have subtracted 1, to show the difference from equal rates of time).

For a more quickly moving planet, like Mercury (fastest in the Solar system), it's about [12 parts per billion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2Fsqrt%281-%28orbital+velocity+of+Mercury%29%5E2%2Fc%5E2%29-1).

Our Solar system is moving around the Galactic center at a velocity of about 200 km/s. That's a much higher velocity, and has a correspondingly much higher gamma factor. It's about [220 parts per billion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2Fsqrt%281-%28orbital+velocity+of+Mercury%29%5E2%2Fc%5E2%29-1) different than at rest.

As a useful scale of reference: one billion seconds is about [31 and a half years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+billion+seconds). So 220 parts per billion amounts to about 7 seconds a year difference.

If there's a civilization out there that can make use of those extra 7 seconds per year to advance their technology, all the power to them. If they're anything like us, they'll probably use them to sleep in 7 seconds longer.

(Technical disclaimer: I have slightly oversimplified parts of this discussion to gloss over details that don't actually change the answer. Yes, I know special relativity is a bit more complicated than this, and you can't objectively say one reference frame is faster than another. Yes, I know that all of these objects are being continuously accelerated and are not in uniform motion. Yes, I know general relativity also contributes effects and that they are probably more significant for most bodies.

9535,"Understandable. I'd go with physics if your end goal is astro. There will be PLENTY of opportunities to learn computation and maths within physics. I had serious FOMO but your independent studying and research and application of that knowledge will lead you to all the other aspects you're interested in. Physics is the basis of literally everything, and the skills you learn can be applied to the other fields you're interested in. It's harder in the other direction. You'll always be able to apply physics/maths/comp science to other aspects, but if physics is your end goal, again, it may help a lot to have the physics under your belt with the principles engrained in your being ( in your gut, not just in your mind, as my profs used to say) as you progress. 

Most places are ok with you doing higher ed degrees in a different (though related) fields, including maths, and comp science.

But the real principles and meat of physics will get lost if you skip out on it early on. By doing physics from the beginning, the principles become instinct and you can apply them and problem solve with them. You're more likely to have a hard time getting into higher ed astro (especially computational astro) without some heavy background concepts of the physics. 

Again, that's kind of how I did, so I'm pretty biased. I did a 2yr degree in engineering then my bachelor's in physics/astro. I'm planning on doing my masters/PhD in either nuclear or materials sci.

&gt; Are lorentz transformations a bitch to simulate? I'm just a layman when it comes to this stuff.

It is a lot easier when using four vectors and matrices. For example to update spaceship velocity, I transform the change of velocity in ship's frame of reference, to world frame, and I get new spaceship velocity. Also of course using units where c=1 helps keep things concise.

I also use matrices to compute aberration and Doppler factor at once: if you transform the spacetime point where the light was emitted, to the ship's frame of reference, you get a new spacetime point. The ratio of time component in the original point and the new point gives you Doppler shift, while the space component gives the new direction that the light is coming from. 

Much simpler, faster, and more tolerant of lower float precision in the shader than manipulating dot products between direction vectors.

One thing that was funny to implement, was the display of the 99.9999999.... % of the speed of light number. If I simply store a floating point number close to 1, I can't have more than about 18 nines. And it doesn't work for the OMG particle. 

Instead I compute 1-β , (which is a small number and can have very small exponent), and then -log10 of it gives me how many nines there are, and I compute 2 more digits.

(where β is speed divided by the speed of light).

[I know what you mean.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Paradoxes_of_motion).

&gt;Can an outside observer of an object collapsing to a singularity say, ""this object has become a singularity *now*""?

Yes.

&gt;If so, why and how?

We apply the theory of relativity when analyzing the dynamics of the system.

&gt;What defines that ""*now*""?

And for whom?  Every observer measures locally a so-called proper time, but the time of observer A as observed by B, a coordinate time, might be different, depending on their situation.

The submillisecond referred is the proper time of a falling particle, observer, a whatever.  From a remote observers -- yours, for example -- perspective relativistic effects prevent you from seeing me ever even cross the event horizon.  I do, but you wouldn't believe it by what you saw with your own eyes!

I guess what happens beyond the event horizon must happen very ""quickly"", to the outside observer (?).

An infinitely small point, it feels to me, is in a way ""infinitely far away"" this from anything that is finite in size. There will always be a smaller ""size"" to fall towards.

9546,"Degree(s) in physics/astro/engineering - I agree, you dont need to decide yet, but all of those options can lead you to a productive path in astro. Go for what feels right after you take a few classes and dig in a bit, see what interests you,  and which methodologies/aspects interest you. Your core major kind of defines those aspects (physics vs engineering, for instance - both take similar classes, though as they progress, the methods and applications split very differently. That's not to say you cant do both, but I have a preference for problem solving math from a physics perspective, but problem solving physical things from an engineering perspective. Similar, though different.) 

 I'm biased, I'd suggest  physics - but my physics program was reaaallllly small and heavy in  computational astrophysics/math/modeling. Depending on how your school/dept/program is set up, you could take courses in other majors to supplement your core major classes. I did this with mechanical engineering. I was kind of the black sheep of my department, as more of a hands-on experimental/applied physics person in a theory/computation heavy department. But if your professors are willing to work with you to get what you want out of your education, you can kind of build off of your core major with other stuff without double majoring. 

Your best bet is to go to the departments and talk to people to try to get a feel for the dept, and its research topics. Make sure there are people actively researching a couple topics you're interested. Talk to them about it - researchers LOVE talking about their work. Talk about the dept dynamic and how the research groups potentially interact.

The star brightness and color are generated somewhat haphazardly (do not conform to real stars), and stars are static (do not explode etc). Also, the average star density is around 1 star per cubic light year (which is considerably higher than around Sun).

Because everything you see in the sky is matter. There is no bulk anti matter (of course here and there anti matter particles are created in collisions from time to time).

&gt;Why would it not be possible that they exist in exactly equal amounts but scattered around the universe in such a way that in some regions where matter was dominant matter-galaxies were formed and in other regions where antimatter was dominant anti-galaxies formed?

This is an FAQ and basically the answer is that that universe isn't ""that empty"" and any large amount of antimatter would be visible from signature radiation produces in annihilation processes. So while it might sound reasonable it is ruled out / incompatible with what we see.

&gt; Not only does this sound like a much more elegant explanation but also doesn't impose the impossible question of why there would be an imbalance between two things that can only appear in pairs. where is the flaw in my reasoning?

There is already known imbalance between matter and antimatter in the standard model, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation, but not enough to explain the imbalance we observe in the universe.

&gt;- I have read a statement saying that in the first second of the Big Bang the universe expanded several lightyears in size. How is that possible? That would mean particles were moving more than 30 million times the speed of light! Isn't it supposed to be impossible to go faster than the speed of light?

This is called inflation. Anyway, it wouldn't mean that particles travelled that fast in a meaningful way , ""breaking the speed of light"". In curved spacetime velocities are only meaningfully defined locally (ie between close by objects). This (local velocities) is what's limited by the speed of light. You can ascribe velocities between far away objects but they ""aren't real velocities"" and can be basically anything (see [this link](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/400457/what-does-general-relativity-say-about-the-relative-velocities-of-objects-that-a)). Generally when we speak of the universe expanding it means the geometry is changing in such a way that distances between objects are increasing. You have a scale factor that is increasing in size. You have a Hubble parameter that tells you how much larger the universe is getting every second. When you pick two galaxies and multiply their distance by that parameter you get something like a velocity and that can be larger than the speed of light, but isn't really a relative velocity between these objects for the reasons described in the link.

&gt;However at some point during the big bang the universe must have had similar density and temperature to allow for nuclear fusion to happen?

I can't give a concise explanation, maybe someone else can but basically ""we know how physics works so we have a good idea of what was able to be produced in the early phase of the universe"" and it wasn't heavy elements.

The expansion of space is not a motion of particles in space. It's adding more space in between the particles, which does not have a speed limit (it is not even a speed, only speed per distance is meaningful).

&gt; However at some point during the big bang the universe must have had similar density and temperature to allow for nuclear fusion to happen? why weren't any heavy elements made during the big bang?

If it is too hot then nuclei are not stable (it's too likely that they are broken apart again). If it is too cold then there is no fusion.

9628,"Great questions! I’m not an expert but I’ll do my best to convey the basic ideas. 

You can think of Earth like a large bar magnet. It has a magnetic north and south pole. Just as a bar magnet generates a magnetic field, Earth’s magnetosphere is a large magnetic field, though generated differently. Earth generates its field via the dynamo effect; there are great videos on this on YouTube. Confusingly, our magnetic north is in the south and vice versa. Neither is near the true poles of the Earth as determined by our axis of rotation. 

If you’ve ever played with a bar magnet, then you know each pole repels some things, attracts others (opposites attract), and some things don’t interact noticeably if at all. What determines the strength of the interaction is the strength of the field and the charge of what it interacts with. The Earth magnetic field deflects charged particles. Charges particles are basically atoms that have been stripped of some of their electrons or have too many electrons. The result is some positive charge particles and some negative charge particles, in equal amounts. Each particle will ride the magnetic field to the pole it prefers based on its charge, giving us the auroras - northern and southern lights. 

This is important because charged particles can disrupt or destroy or electronics. Additionally high energy particles and radiation can damage DNA in living organisms which can lead to cancer and other ill effects, although the primary defense against radiation is the ozone layer. 

I can’t speak much to how losing the magnetic field would impact life, but we could definitely expect there to be damage to our satellites and electronic infrastructure. I do know that we know the field has weakened/disappeared many times in the past. There is a lot of active research on learning how magnetosphere weakening may have impacted life, but it’s not well understood. Someone may be able to provide good sources on this. 

I hope some of this helped. If you want a more in depth explanation on some things I can maybe pull sources together when I have more time. Good luck with your project!",1580923809,astrophysics,Kapin32,Astrophysics,Comment,362

9637,"&gt;Actually I've been thinking about this. I'm sure there are more nuances to this that I'm not going to try to grasp, but I'm a little perplexed as to why popular science books, magazines, and shows, even ones which I think are quite good and reputable, perpetuated these ideas. A quantum vacuum containing fields with constant-non-zero energy is so much more simple than some complicated explanation about particles popping in and out of existence. Why try to make these things more complicated then they are? Your answer is so much more simple and intuitive.

So my armchair theory is that they need (or feel the need to) to make things seem more mechanistic and plastic for their audience, and less abstract. 

With explanations there is two parts : 1 how easy it is to understand and 2 the degree to which it actually explains the phenomenon. I feel that these sources focus so much more on 1 and giving the audience the illusion that they've understood something (to higher degree than they actually did) than on whether the explanation given actually coherently explains it (and whether the explanation can actually be successfully used  to explain phenomena beyond the topic). 

Apparently it is unacceptable for them to give an explanation that would trigger follow up questions because it isn't self-contained. 

And I feel like sometimes when they justify inaccuracies as simplifications they often haven't even meaningful simplified anything. They just sacrificed accuracy for little or no benefit in terms of simplicity. 

One thing that I find remarkable though is how strongly their versions stick in people's minds. Much more strongly than accurate physics. Actual explanations can often be very volatile, ie you can explain stuff ten times and it doesn't stick. With many of these popscience myths even though they are inaccurate they seem to stick very easily and almost spread themselves with no learning effort needed. It's from experience an uphill battle to unteach. 

&gt;Wouldn't it be easier to just explain to laypeople that quantum fields always have a ground state energy level that isn't zero? Why bother confusing people.

My view is that an accurate overview should be given that isn't necessarily self contained (ie  might contain terminology that the reader doesn't understand but which serves the purpose of hiding detail / intricacies to make it concise). The reader then has a starting point to ask follow up questions and fill in these gaps. Forums like reddit are especially suitable for such a dialog. I always ask myself what's so wrong about having to do more detailed reading afterwards? 


&gt;I wish that popular science books/shows etc. when discussing highly technical ideas that simply cannot be understood by a layperson like myself, would just say ""this is the way it is and until you can understand the math and the intricate details of the underlying physics, you are just going to have to accept it. We are not going to try to give an intuitive explanation because there isn't one for laypeople and it would just mislead you"", and then move on to what the implications of the theory are. Being given false explanations like this makes me lose some faith in my favorite pop-sci sources, even ones like Scientific American or PBS Spacetime which I honestly think are normally quite good and accurate.

I agree. I feel like even though a lot of stuff is accurate in these shows there's often moments where they get stuff wrong (and it's often the same things) and often they don't really own up to it / aren't too transparent about it. Sometimes they double down.

9643,"&gt;Would it be inaccurate to say, in a vacuum, absent observation, that there may be a spike in the energy of a quantum field different from the non-zero energy that quantum fields normally occupy in a vacuum? Would such a spike only exist if you were not observing the field, or could it be observed, in theory?

Yes it would be inaccurate. The vacuum just is the ground state with zero particles (but non zero energy). It doesn't change over time, unless you create particles by putting in energy (ie go into one of the most basic excited states of the quantum field, so you are no longer in the vacuum state). 

It has nothing to do with observing or not observing. Not sure what ""absent observation"" actually is supposed to mean in the several instances you bring up observation here. 

The links don't mention this outside of dodgy myths. The only unobjectionable mentions  of it are ""an observable"" (ie physical quantities that can be measured), stuff being unobservable (adjective) (ie not something that would occur in experiments to be measured). What you mention only comes up when they outright give accounts of the popscience myths that tend to mix in ""observation"" and ""collapse"" into this to justify talking about unobservable stuff as if real. Particularly in the third link. 

Example myth

*Thus ”in reality” (meaning in the simplified virtual reality painted for the general public) all particles should be viewed as virtual until they are observed (where they obviously are real).*

&gt;I know that absent observation, the different quantum fields in the vacuum exist at different non-zero energy levels, but that observation causes them to collapse to zero.

Hm no. Not sure what you mean by collapse to zero. The vacuum is already the ground state and you can't go lower. Despite its energy not being zero. Vacuum it ground state energy is also called zero point energy. 

&gt;Is there really no such thing as fluctuations in vacuum energy, do the quantum fields, absent observation, actually exist at a consistent energy level in the vacuum without changes?

The state is stationary so it doesn't change (neither particle number nor energy) . 

&gt;I got a sense of why the vacuum fluctuation picture in popular science accounts is wrong from the article but I did not get a sense of what is actually right.

Instead it's more correct to think of the vacuum as a state which isn't ""trivial"" or ""physically inert"" so to speak, despite not fluctuating over time and despite not containing any particles. The fields take part in physics even in their ground state (no particles). See vacuum polarisation in the first link for example. 

&gt;It almost seems like, from the articles, that the answer is we don't really know,

We do know. This is all taught early on  in QFT textbooks. :) Not unresolved / open problems. It's just a) a complicated topic with many subtleties to keep in mind (and lot of qualifiers needed to make accurate statements) and b) a lot of sources make up stuff about it so a lot of inaccuracies ghost around. So the articles go out of their way to enumerate a ton of things that are not correct. That may make it seem as if it is not clearly known.

You must imagine that there's already comments from laymen in discussion that ask whether we actually know if virtual particles aren't real after all, which is ludicrous, given that physics itself defines virtual particles (as certain mathematical things in calculations) and they are by definition not real / not observable and we don't have to find out if they are real or not or anything like that since they aren't subject of measurements, by how we have conceived them in the first place.",1580680051,astrophysics,lettuce_field_theory,Astrophysics,Comment,633

9650,"&gt;but cant seem to understand how multiple temporal dimensions would work, even from a purely mathematical perspective.

Well the paper (already linked) and this graphic tells you that it wouldn't really work.

&gt;How can something happen (1,-5) seconds after something else? If they are both moving at a constant rate (as in our universe locally) wouldnt the second one be redundant and, similar to measuring in both metric and imperial, one could convert between the 2 with little to no effort? 

I feel like this is more of a general math question. Going onto a mathematical level of relations here. You can't have a total order on a two-dimensional plane of real numbers. For instance you can't define a total order for complex numbers\*. You are kinda assuming a time dimension has to have it, and that seems reasonable (and met by just having one time dimensions), but as the paper says there are problems even doing physics (being mathematically able to make predictions) if you have multiple time dimensions, so it certainly isn't the only problem with it that you can't tell what's earlier and what's later.

9658,"OK, I'll bite.

Let's say ""magic"" is able to keep one pole constantly pointed towards the sun. Keeping with your fantasy setting, let's also assume that the amount of ""magical energy"" that has to be expended by someone is roughly equivalent to the physical forces produced.

So for something trivial like a ""fireball"" spell we are talking about something like a few MJ of energy (1E6). The amount of energy required to change the rotational axis of Earth to keep it pointed towards the sun is something like 2E26 J per Day! Let's say a truly powerful mage can cast a fireball every second for 8 hours without pause (which would make him stupidly powerful in any fantasy setting). You would need 3.5 quadrillion mages of similar power to channel all their power into the pointless task of keeping the pole towards the sun.

Assuming the planet is as big as earth that would put about 10 mages on every square meter of surface area. Good luck feeding them.

The main issue your planet is going to have is that one side will bake, and the other will freeze, confining life to the regions in between. You can offset this a bit by making the 'moon' large and reflective, so it provides some extra heat on the night side (this will sound familiar if you've ever played a Borderlands game).

However, the theories are compatible, to a degree. There is a framework, called effective field theory, in which both general relativity and quantum mechanics work perfectly well together, so long as you don't attempt to describe physical processes that occur over extremely short distances.

The thing is, the theories only fail to be compatible at distances far smaller than we will be able to probe in the foreseeable future. The effective field theory for gravity suffices for pretty much every experiment and observation we make.

https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/physics-virtual-particles/

https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/misconceptions-virtual-particles/

https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/vacuum-fluctuation-myth/

The article itself is also contains several inaccuracies. The zero energy universe is a hypothesis for starters and not what most physicists believe.

&gt;Light, matter and antimatter are what physicists call ""positive energy."" [...] Most physicists think, however, that there is an equal amount of ""negative energy"" stored in the gravitational attraction that exists between all the positive-energy particles.

For starers that wouldn't result in zero energy, because most energy in the universe is not light and matter, but dark energy. 

&gt;Stephen Hawking explains the concept of negative energy in his book The Theory of Everything (New Millennium 2002): ""Two pieces of matter that are close to each other have less [positive] energy than the same two pieces a long way apart, because you have to expend energy to separate them against the gravitational force that is pulling them together,"" he wrote.

&gt;Since it takes positive energy to separate the two pieces of matter, gravity must be using negative energy to pull them together

Also inaccurate / misleading. Gravity isn't ""using negative energy to pull them together"". That negative energy is just binding energy. A bound system has a lower energy than the system of the two unbound parts. This is first semester. 

&gt;""Quantum theory, and specifically Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, provide a natural explanation for how that energy may have come out of nothing,"" wrote Filippenko and Pasachoff.

&gt;They continued, ""Throughout the universe, particles and antiparticles spontaneously form and quickly annihilate each other without violating the law of energy conservation. These spontaneous births and deaths of so-called 'virtual particle' pairs are known as 'quantum fluctuations.' Indeed, laboratory experiments have proven that quantum fluctuations occur everywhere, all the time.""

Is outright wrong (see links above). This is a common misconception about the uncertainty principle.

&gt;Cosmologists have constructed a theory called inflation that accounts for the way in which a small volume of space occupied by a virtual particle pair could have ballooned to become the vast universe we see today.

Also outright wrong description of inflation..

Overall it's a poor lay summary of an actual research hypothesis.

Putting a Sean Carroll quote in there doesn't safe that and it isn't even a Sean Carroll quote. The Sean Carroll quote is this

&gt;In a lecture, Caltech cosmologist Sean Carroll put it this way: ""You can create a compact, self-contained universe without needing any energy at all.""

(If you read my comment above you see that I'm quoting an article written by Carroll himself as well, where he says energy isn't conserved and the total is increasing as the universe expands.)

Then you pull rank by other people to argue with a physicist... (not just rank but you argue their PhD is worth more because it's from a particular university in North America.. have you ever heard people from places outside US quote where they got their PhD from to support their argument?

9791,"""The effect of a star's initial mass on its evolution"" could be a good one. Stellar evolution is very interesting and doesn't have to be extremely complicated. Of course the frontier research in it is very complex (its almost entirely theoretical, so lots of maths and simulations), but there's plenty of resources on it that explain it well without barely touching maths at all. As long as you have some understanding of standard notation to get an idea of scales (for example 1 solar mass = 1 x 10^(30)kg), then you're golden.

Just to give a quick overview:

Low mass (&lt;2 solar masses) stars evolve along what we call the 'main sequence', fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores - this process, nuclear fusion, generates the energy that holds the star up against its own gravity. After the hydrogen in its core has all been fused into helium, there is no energy source, so the star begins to contract and enters post-main sequence evolution, in which it goes through several 'giant' stages and eventually ends up as a white dwarf star surrounded by a planetary nebula.

High mass (&gt;8 solar masses) stars originally evolve the same way until hydrogen in the core runs out. The post-main sequence evolution of a massive star involves many phases and eventually leads it to becoming a core-collapse supernova, with the core left behind as either a neutron star or a black hole. You could also talk about the mass-lifetime relation and how high mass stars have much shorter lifes than low mass stars.

You could really go as in depth as you need to in this topic, or you could make it fairly brief. There's plenty of good resources out there on this, some of which you might find in your school's library. It's also particularly interesting at the minute as Betelguese, a nearby massive star in the last stage of its life, is starting to act weird and it might go supernova 'soon' (within a few hundred thousand years).

9814,"**Holographic principle**

The holographic principle is a tenet of string theories and a supposed property of quantum gravity that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region—such as a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon. First proposed by Gerard 't Hooft, it was given a precise string-theory interpretation by Leonard Susskind who combined his ideas with previous ones of 't Hooft and Charles Thorn. As pointed out by Raphael Bousso, Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits a lower-dimensional description in which gravity emerges from it in what would now be called a holographic way.  The prime example of holography is the AdS/CFT correspondence.

9815,"Cosmology isn't my field, but to address a few points:

The physics of the big bang is extremely complicated and there are still a lot of issues with the big bang model that are currently under investigations, such as the flatness problem and the horizon problem) That said, its still the best cosmological theory we have by far. I think we're a long way off being able to determine the amount of energy in the universe / energy of the big bang, and it definitely can't be calculated with just E=mc^(2): as already mentioned in this thread, E=mc^(2) only works for an objects at rest.

The question of why the big bang would have 'chosen' such a value is very difficult to answer: why do any of the physical constants, like the gravitational constant or the speed of light,  have the values they do? Again, if there's an answer to that question, we're a very long way off finding it.

Regarding a 'holographic universe', it depends on if you mean the [Holographic Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle) (part of string theory) or the 'holofractal theory' proposed by Nassim Haramein. The former is a part of theoretical physics - i'm no theorist, but it seems to be accepted within the framework of theoretical physics (hopefully a theorist on here can confirm or deny this). Haramein's Holofractal theory, however, is not a scientific theory and thus is not accepted by the scientific community. Without going too much into my personal views on holofractal, I will say that the fact that there's never been a paper on it published in a peer-reviewed journal doesn't fill me with confidence. In my view, its pseudoscience.

Hope that helps!",1580006269,astrophysics,ErtheAndAxen,Astrophysics,Comment,279
9816,"&gt; It doesn’t need to have a constant force to keep acceleration in that case and would only need an initial force.

Sounds like you're thinking of velocity. If you apply an initial force, the object it's applied to will reach some velocity, and in space, because of no friction, it will keep going at that velocity.

Acceleration (changing, e.g. increasing velocity) doesn't work like that. You only accelerate as long as you're applying force. The instant you stop applying force, your acceleration goes to zero.",1579989969,astrophysics,antonivs,Astrophysics,Comment,86
9817,"&gt; But there is still no force to stop acceleration, so how does adding mass change this? 

Acceleration requires the constant application of force. To apply force requires energy, e.g. in the form of burning rocket fuel. As soon as you stop applying force, e.g. stop burning rocket fuel, you stop accelerating.

 As you get closer to the speed of light, the amount of force and energy required to maintain the same acceleration increases. This is what stops us from actually reaching the speed of light - it would require infinite energy to do that.
 
&gt; Even if acceleration becomes very small it is still an acceleration.

It doesn't matter. Let's say you had an infinite energy drive, and infinite fuel to go along with it. This would allow you to maintain constant acceleration indefinitely. Even so, you still couldn't reach the speed of light - the effects of that acceleration keeps decreasing as your speed increases.",1579989753,astrophysics,antonivs,Astrophysics,Comment,157

9855,"The closest galaxy to us is Andromeda, which is 2.5 million light years away. This means that if we were to sound out light with the aim of it reflecting off of Andromeda and coming back to us, it would take 5 million years.

Thankfully, we don't have to send out waves, we just have to detect the light they emit. This is what eyes do, the sun for example emits light and your eye detects it. Andromeda emits light and your eye might be able to just make it out, but we can use a camera with a longer exposure time to collect more of the light and therefore get a better image. Another way of collecting more light is using more area to collect the light in, this is why a telescope with a bigger apature (primary mirror diameter) is better.

&gt;I read about the Spitzer space telescope using infrared imaging, how do they turn the waves into images

Its essentially the same as taking a picture, just that the frequency of the light is lower than visible (in the visible spectrum it goes from red with the low frequency to blue with high frequency). The detector used is called a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) and works similar to the camera detector in your phone. Essentially, some light strikes the detector and causes the material to emit an electron which we can detect as an electric signal and from this signal recreate the image.

Without going to Oxbridge? Absolutely. There are dozens of well respected universities for physics and astronomy in the UK. Without going to university though? Not really.

9874,"There are 3 things that will slow down your ship...

1. friction with the interstellar medium. The vacuum of space is not a complete vacuum. There are a few gas molecules floating around. The amount of drag though is extremely low compared to what you're used to seeing on earth. If you took a drag force from earth and moved the decimal point to the left, you'd have to move it at least 15 places over to get the drag force in space. In some places in space, you may have to move it over up to 25 places. So the amount of drag you'd have in 1 second on earth would take at least 30 million years in space, and maybe up to 300 quadrillion years. Because this drag force is so low, people usually ignore it and pretend it's zero.
2. Cosmic expansion. Because the universe is expanding, your velocity will change over time because space itself is actually expanding. If you measure your velocity relative to your starting point, it will actually increase over time. If you measure your velocity relative to what's around you, it will decrease over time. In either case, we're talking about a few percent per billion years.
3. Radiation pressure. On average, Doppler shift will mean that the CMB and the other light ahead of you will be slightly blue-shifted and light behind you will be slightly red shifted. The net effect will be slightly more radiation pressure slowing you down than pushing you from behind. Again, this effect will be negligible unless you are going a significant fraction of light speed, or are considering time scales of at least millions of years.

All these effects added together are completely negligible in most situations.

For that you'd have to keep creating new stars indefinitely, which won't happen because there is a finite amount of material (gas) in a given ""volume"" of the universe (doesn't matter if the universe is infinite in size; you can't create stars with gas that is a billion light-years away). Also, even if the universe is infinite spatially, it doesn't create new matter out of the void (OK it does by quantum fluctuations but that's not relevant here). So once the available gas is transformed into stars then into stellar remnants, then it's not available anymore to create new stars.
I'm not sure if that's clear? I think the main idea here is that even though the universe is infinite, it is causally ""connected"" to a limited space (because of the event horizon, what is called the visible universe, I can explain that more if you want), so you have to consider what happens inside this volume. The rest of the universe, infinite or not, doesn't influence what's in this volume.",1579785918,astrophysics,cacaputput,Astrophysics,Comment,197

At some point there's no fuel so it's not true that you always have stars at all stages.

&gt;To me that explanation only makes sense if the stars were all the same age...then even if they were infinite they would die at some point all together;

 it's also not required that they all die at the same time.

But if the stars aren't all the same age and infinite (let's assume they are infinite in an infinite universe) wouldn't something always be using energy?

9910,"The uncertainty principle tells us is that the vacuum is a *superposition* of quantum states that have different energy levels, according to the uncertainty principle.

When you actually measure the energy level in a vacuum, that measurement will produce a value which will effectively be zero, because zero is the value to which the superposition will typically ""collapse"".

But in certain scenarios, where there is sufficient energy present in other forms, it is possible to model the process of real particle creation in terms of ""virtual particles"" that are given an external energy boost to produce real particles.

Without the uncertainty principle and the real phenomenon of which virtual particles are a model, these processes would not occur.

In his original paper on Hawking radiation, Hawking used this model, but warned that ""It should be emphasized that these pictures of the mechanism ... are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally.""

The picture that many people in this thread are objecting to seems mainly to be the idea that ""the vacuum consists of virtual particles constantly being created and annihilated."" That is indeed a somewhat perverse way to think of the quantum vacuum. 

But that doesn't mean that the model is entirely wrong or useless - after all, it can be used to produce correct predictions! It just means that one needs to be careful about what the model does and doesn't imply - but unfortunately, pop science descriptions of this often either get it wrong or say things that are very misleading.

As the Strassler article I linked elsewhere put it:

&gt; The best way to approach this concept, I believe, is to forget you ever saw the word “particle” in the term. A virtual particle is not a particle at all. It refers precisely to a disturbance in a field that is not a particle.",1579715163,astrophysics,antonivs,Astrophysics,Comment,309
9911,"The model is quantum field theory and virtual particles are not part of the modelling.

It's misleading to say that Hawking used virtual particle model in his paper. He didn't.

They're a model of a physical phenomenon though, so while they aren't ""real"" in the sense of having an independent existence and ""popping in and out of existence,"" the model has real physical consequences.

&gt; And no, neither Hawking radiation nor Casimir effect is such evidence.

Hawking used the virtual particle model as a ""heuristic"" model in his 1975 paper on Hawking radiation. If the model is correctly understood in terms of what it does and doesn't say, it's still a useful model that can actually explain what's happening and even make correct predictions.

9913,"&gt; I'm not sure exactly where this claim comes from

Stephen Hawking used a virtual particle model in his original 1975 paper about Hawking radiation:

&gt;  One might picture this negative energy flux in the following way. Just outside the event horizon there will be virtual pairs of particles, one with negative energy and one with positive energy. The negative particle is in a region which is classically forbidden but it can tunnel through the event horizon to the region inside the black hole where the Killing vector which represents time translations is spacelike. In this region the particle can exist as a real particle with a timelike momentum vector even though its energy relative to infinity as measured by the time translation Killing vector is negative. The other particle of the pair, having a positive energy, can escape to infinity where it constitutes a part of the thermal emission described above. The probability of the negative energy particle tunnelling through the horizon is governed by the surface gravity K since this quantity measures the gradient of the magnitude of the Killing vector or, in other words, how fast the Killing vector is becoming spacelike. Instead of thinking of negative energy particles tunnelling through the horizon in the positive sense of time one could regard them as positive energy particles crossing the horizon on pastdirected world-lines and then being scattered on to future-directed world-lines by the gravitational field. **It should be emphasized that these pictures of the mechanism responsible for the thermal emission and area decrease are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally.**",1579713256,astrophysics,antonivs,Astrophysics,Comment,266

In the same way as you were saying that it's not the velocity itself that would kill you, I was saying the acceleration needed to get close to c doesn't need to kill you, as long as you keep it down to reasonable levels.

So:

* High velocity by itself doesn't kill you, as you pointed out.
* High enough acceleration will kill you, but you don't need super-high acceleration to get close to the speed of light. Sustained moderate acceleration won't kill you and could get you close to the speed of light, except...
* What will kill you no matter what, in our universe, is the increased particle density and energy at high enough velocities.

One useful way to think about this is that the faster you travel, the more compressed space seems to you. Particles seem closer together - you hit them more often - and just as with compression, their energy becomes higher (relative to you.)

9966,"&gt; Your mass would increase greatly if you were traveling that fast.

It would not, at least not in the way ""mass"" has been used in physics for the last 80 years or so. You think of the concept of relativistic mass, but using that just leads to confusion. In your own reference frame you never move - only acceleration or contact with other things can kill you.",1579460797,astrophysics,mfb-,Astrophysics,Comment,68
9967,"&gt;You can survive traveling at any (possible) speed; what would kill you is acceleration.

You're not obliged to accelerate too much, though.  1g for a year is enough to get you into the ""relativistic"" domain, and you would be adding 9s to your 0.9...\*c sequence from about the third year on.

If you would be travelling at the speed of the [OMG particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle), every proton on your way would hit you effectively like a baseball from a good hitter.  Not saying that's absolutely impossible to shield from, but even in [intergalactic voids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#Examples) there's about 1 particle per cubic meter, so you would be hitting many over the cosmological distances you'd be crossing.

And many, many more than that if you encountered a star.

&gt;EDIT: My dumb brain made me forget relativity. Your mass would increase greatly if you were traveling that fast.

Thinking about velocity-related mass increase, while (barely) allowed by (special) relativity, is generally [not advisable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity).  Think of increased kinetic energy instead.

&gt;It is possible both you and the star get destroyed traveling close to light speed.

I'd like to object to the concept of destroying a star with a high-velocity human, but then I don't want to mess with arbitrary precision calculations today to find out what sort of velocity would make that even a remote possibility -- so have it your way, this time :-)",1579455955,astrophysics,ketarax,Astrophysics,Comment,228

9972,"Ok, If you could reach a speed as close to lightspeed and possible, and you could survive the acceleration to that speed, you would have the same problem trying to fly through the Sun as if you would try to fly through literally anything else. You have such an absurd amount of energy, that the collision with any kind of particle produces a nuclear reaction, even the collision with photons would give them enough energy to produce electron-positron pairs. You could probably survive (I am no sure) the collision with sparse atoms in the vacuum of space, but as soon as the density of the gas becomes non-negligible, you would immediately die. In your reference frame, every collision with an atom would be like a bullet thrown at you at almost lightspeed.",1579446845,astrophysics,Javimoran,Astrophysics,Comment,132
9973,"The speed of light is c in ***all*** valid reference frames. If you try and take the reference frame of light, you'll notice that light is no longer travelling at c relative to that frame. This is because there is no reference frame for the speed of light.

You can't be in a reference frame which doesn't exist. We are used to velocities adding linearly as vectors. 10ms^-1 to the right + 5ms^-1 to the right equals 15ms^-1 to the right. This is not the case in relativity, as we have to take into account the relativistic effects of time dilation and length contraction, once you do this you get the [Einstein Velocity Addition formula](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/veltran.html#c1). 

Now if we have two spaceships A and B, with A moving at 0.8c to the left relative to Earth and B moving to the right at 0.8c relative to Earth, we find that their velocities relative to each other are ~0.98c. We can see from this equation that velocities can never add to be c.",1579442567,astrophysics,Lewri,Astrophysics,Comment,171

9975,"1. You cannot travel at lightspeed. It is the universal and unbreakable speed limit.
2. You can survive traveling at any (possible) speed; what would kill you is acceleration.
3. If you were a cosmic projectile traveling at 99.99% of lightspeed into the sun, you would certainly die. Collisions between the particles that make up you and the particles that make up the Sun would fry you. I’m not sure if your burnt crisp would get all the way through the star but it is highly likely the absurd mass of the Sun would eventually stop you some point midway. An object traveling at close to lightspeed hurtling into a star would normally create a large enough amount of force to at least disrupt the stability of an object but you are not very massive and thus I imagine the force such a collision would produce would be negligible to the sun but not to you. You would explode in more ways than one.
TL;DR: you can’t travel that fast, and if you could I wouldn’t recommend traveling into the sun at said speed is the best thing to do with such power.",1579440513,astrophysics,Barethyu,Astrophysics,Comment,193

9997,"Light has a frequency that can be measured. What you see is the frequency of light at the instant and location that you measure. At that time and location, it has a particular frequency which could be red or any color.

The redshift is measurable of you know the initial (at source) frequency of the light. That is, since you already know the destination frequency, if you additionally know the source frequency, you can measure how much the frequency shifted (red side or blue side).

So the question arises how can we know the source frequency. Well, every atom in the periodic table has a ""signature"" spectrum. For example, the spectrum of hydrogen has K, L, M, N ... series lines at a fixed known frequencies. Hydrogen K lines for example have the simplest frequency pattern constant/n^2 .

So, if you observe a spectrum of the received light, which is never just a single frequency, and correlate it with known spectrums, then you can identify which atoms were the source of this light, of any. This is commonly known as emission spectroscopy.

Once you have identified the source elements, you know the source frequencies of the lines in the spectrum. The emission spectrum of atoms are universal constants.",1579256693,astrophysics,MrMakeItAllUp,Astrophysics,Comment,208
