22,What makes a good quantum use case?,1615907815,"TLDR: can someone explain simply what makes a good use case for quantum computing with some examples?

It's pretty clear that almost every industry is trying to come up with some problem to justify investing in quantum computing, and once in a while there is a new press release about some very specific problem where it sort of made sense to use a quantum computer, like portfolio optimization (investing) or codon optimization for DNA (pharma) like in this article: [https://www.zdnet.com/article/quantum-computing-quantum-annealing-versus-gate-based-quantum-computers/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/quantum-computing-quantum-annealing-versus-gate-based-quantum-computers/)

The common theme seems to be the requirement to fiddle with many different variables at the same time to assess the outcome.....sort of like trying to tune in a radio with 50 different knobs that can all be turned at the same time and the position of any one of them might affect the optimum position of the others.

Right when I start to think that this kind of thing will apply to the most sexy scientific problems rich with high-level physics, the problems with a high economic impact (if you are able to make an incremental improvement) might seem more important.

I attended a talk recently by a company in the aeronautics industry who ran a quantum challenge and rather than choosing a winning team who proposed a solution to a very physics-rich problem like airplane wing design etc. they went with a team that focused on loading of cargo into planes as a use case for quantum.

The overall theme seems to be that you can kind of convince yourself that there might be some real world applications for quantum computing once the hardware improves in a few years, but it sounds like people are happy to say that our brains aren't used to thinking up problems that quantum computing will be able to solve, so that's why we are having trouble thinking of use cases.....and definitely not because there aren't any.

I'm with the Quantum Computing Club @ UC Davis and this **Friday from 4-5pm PST** Professor Curro will be joining us to give a talk on his research  in color centers. Below you can read a quick overview of what this  week's meeting will entail:

I  will give a brief introduction to the science of nitrogen-vacancy  centers in diamond, and how they can be used for quantum sensing and  quantum information science.  The science of NV centers has advanced  dramatically over the past decade, and they are now regularly used for a  broad range of field and temperature sensing, quantum information  storage, and even inertial navigation systems.   I will introduce  concepts such as quantum superposition, and how to manipulate a quantum  bit, and how to use an NV center as a sensor.

161,What is the use of quantum tomography?,1613123054,"First time poster and just started with quantum computing for my master thesis, so I'm sorry if the question seems obvious.

I understand that the tomography is used to reconstruct the state and/or process of a quantum circuit, without directly measuring the used qubits but instead using many 'copies' of it. What we then get is the quantum state as a density matrix or the quantum process in e.g. choi matrix representation.

But isn't this process of tomography way too costly to really make use of it? 
If I understand it correctly, we could use this choi matrix representation to replace our circuit process, but does it improve something?
And can we use the state tomography for anything else than verification/error mitigation?",QuantumComputing,riovel,7,Quantum,Post,"What is the use of quantum tomography? First time poster and just started with quantum computing for my master thesis, so I'm sorry if the question seems obvious.

Further down the line (and into speculation) we could see current industry standard encryptions broken by quantum computing &amp; or be able to transmit data instantaneously. The reason I lumped these two together is because either would make a large portion of our financial systems (increasingly digital) largely obsolete or unsafe.

I'd love to hear what someone more educated than me on the topic has to say about the potential financial implications of qc.",207

I'm writing a general quantum computer simulator in Python, just for fun. It's working well. Have simulated the Deutsch-Josza circuit, and the multi-qubit version, and a few other toy examples. I'm trying to write it in such a way that there will be a super easy one-one correspondence between how the code is written and how circuits are drawn.

I'm having a little trouble with my swap gate, but I can't work out what's wrong. Before we get into the code of it all (which is by no means guaranteed to be valid), I just want to check that my understanding is correct in the first place.

# Quantum Superposition

Quantum superposition is in layman terms, 'combination of states'. When I say states I mean any two or more distinguishable factors. In basic electronics theories, you may come across electrical states as 'high' and 'low'. Usually what we do is that we call 5V a high state and any voltage below that a low state (usually 0V but it doesn't really have to be 0V).

Let's take these high and low states to a standard 5V and 0V system. If you get 5V, you get a high state. If you get 0V, you get a low state. Now, we have set a certain upper bound (5V) and a certain lower bound (0V). We intentionally set a range around the upper and lower bounds to be on par with practical errors. Let's say we keep -1V to 1V as the ""low"" state and 4V to 6V as the ""high"" state. So any voltage between -1V and 1V will give a state of ""low"" and any voltage between 4V and 6V will give a state of ""high"". Any other value is neglected.

As you may see, we can only have either a ""low"" state or a ""high"" state but not both together. We cannot define a state that is ""low"" and ""high"" at the same time. So we call this a binary state. Because we can have only 2 states. Either ""low"" or ""high"".

But in quantum computing, things are different. I will explain why.

We need to go to the sub-atomic level to understand this. But first I want you to know something. There exists a theory named the ""de Broglie hypothesis"". Though it is a hypothesis we can observe its predictions very well. According to the de Broglie hypothesis, the matter that we are made of can show wavelike properties. But it is not conspicuous at the macro level. But when you go to the sub-atomic level things get groovy. The sub-atomic particles start to show wavelike properties.

Now, without going into deeper levels of physics let's say, a wave has the property of diffraction. That is, the wave can spread out while going through a narrow opening. You can observe this in everyday life. But the spooky thing is that when particles also start to do this at the subatomic level. Why? Because as I mentioned before, according to that de Broglie hypothesis, particles are bound to have that wavelike property.

Now, this brings us to a dilemma. Where can actually the particle be? Well, when we explain the particle in a wavelike manner we use something called ""wave function"". This wave function is what explains the position of the particle. We can make a measurement on that and find out the position. But then we come across another phenomenon called ""the uncertainty principle"". Without going into much detail let's say, this wave function fails to give both the position and the velocity of the particle at the same accuracy. If we make a measurement on the position we cannot get a good result of the velocity as the error will be too high. It's the same the other way too. So, we come across this uncertainty of both the position and velocity of the sub-atomic particle.

Now, how does this matter to us?

When we explain the properties of the sub-atomic particle which we use for states, we come across this uncertainty and we can only give a probability of which state it could be in. So it turns out, we can actually use this uncertainty to our advantage. So, this idea of superposition comes up. Since we can give only a probability of what state it could be, it leaves us with a superposition of these two states with probabilities of different values.

We use these superposition states as qubits. Yes, that's right!

# Quantum Entanglement

This is a weird theory, to be honest. But it is understandable. To say it very simply, quantum entanglement is two particles being in one system (a composite system) and when they do this they determine each other's properties. They cannot be explained separately but together. To put it even more simply, they are two particles acting like one. The weirdness of this is that there is no need for these two particles to be together at the same place. They can be in two different places thousands of miles apart. 

How does this happen?

Well, remember I mentioned a ""wave function"" earlier? Well, in this case, they have an ""entangled"" wave function. That means the wave functions are tied together to make a whole new wave function. But, the spooky thing is that, once we make an observation on either of these particles the wave function collapses into two different wave functions. There's a famous experiment on the spin of the particle regarding this quantum entanglement paradox. But explaining that requires a whole new article. Let's just say, simply, without being all scientific, ""particles have the ability to communicate within themselves before showing themselves to us."" (But this is not really what's happening though. This way makes it easier to understand.) 

How does this matter to us?

In cryptography, we have this need of generating public and private keys. These are really big numbers or patterns with complex relations. While creating these public keys we get this need of generating random numbers. Say that we have two qubits that are entangled. We need to have a private key between these two qubits. So what we do is that we generate random numbers on one qubit. Since these qubits are entangled, the other qubit gives the exact same outputs of random numbers on the other side. How cool is that? Also, there's this theory that explains that we cannot copy a qubit. That means we cannot create a clone of an entangled qubit either. So, it makes cracking the randomly generated key even tougher than we could imagine. You can search for Pauli's exclusion principle if you want further explanation on the ""non-cloning"" theory. But let's keep it the layman's level and say, entanglement is a real friend of ours when it comes to quantum cryptography.

# Decoherence

Let's start with what coherence is. Coherence is a property of waves that share common properties. So, in the wave function of some subatomic particles, we may observe correlations of physical properties. Actually, this is what leads to the entanglement of particles. Particles that are entangled relate themselves in every way. This property of relation is called coherence. But this coherence fades away due to external factors. That is called decoherence. 

How does this matter to us?

Well, in order to keep the entanglement of a pair of subatomic particles, we need to keep the coherence between the two particles as long as possible. To do that, we need to keep these particles in an environment that is isolated from the external world. That means we need sophisticated methods to isolate these particles. Sometimes we use supercooling methods to isolate and use an electromagnetic field to keep them stable in a sophisticated vacuum chamber.

# Quantum Superposition

Quantum superposition is in layman terms, 'combination of states'. When I say states I mean any two or more distinguishable factors. In basic electronics theories, you may come across electrical states as 'high' and 'low'. Usually what we do is that we call 5V a high state and any voltage below that a low state (usually 0V but it doesn't really have to be 0V).

Let's take these high and low states to a standard 5V and 0V system. If you get 5V, you get a high state. If you get 0V, you get a low state. Now, we have set a certain upper bound (5V) and a certain lower bound (0V). We intentionally set a range around the upper and lower bounds to be on par with practical errors. Let's say we keep -1V to 1V as the ""low"" state and 4V to 6V as the ""high"" state. So any voltage between -1V and 1V will give a state of ""low"" and any voltage between 4V and 6V will give a state of ""high"". Any other value is neglected.

As you may see, we can only have either a ""low"" state or a ""high"" state but not both together. We cannot define a state that is ""low"" and ""high"" at the same time. So we call this a binary state. Because we can have only 2 states. Either ""low"" or ""high"".

But in quantum computing, things are different. I will explain why.

We need to go to the sub-atomic level to understand this. But first I want you to know something. There exists a theory named the ""de Broglie hypothesis"". Though it is a hypothesis we can observe its predictions very well. According to the de Broglie hypothesis, the matter that we are made of can show wavelike properties. But it is not conspicuous at the macro level. But when you go to the sub-atomic level things get groovy. The sub-atomic particles start to show wavelike properties.

Now, without going into deeper levels of physics let's say, a wave has the property of diffraction. That is, the wave can spread out while going through a narrow opening. You can observe this in everyday life. But the spooky thing is that when particles also start to do this at the subatomic level. Why? Because as I mentioned before, according to that de Broglie hypothesis, particles are bound to have that wavelike property.

Now, this brings us to a dilemma. Where can actually the particle be? Well, when we explain the particle in a wavelike manner we use something called ""wave function"". This wave function is what explains the position of the particle. We can make a measurement on that and find out the position. But then we come across another phenomenon called ""the uncertainty principle"". Without going into much detail let's say, this wave function fails to give both the position and the velocity of the particle at the same accuracy. If we make a measurement on the position we cannot get a good result of the velocity as the error will be too high. It's the same the other way too. So, we come across this uncertainty of both the position and velocity of the sub-atomic particle.

Now, how does this matter to us?

When we explain the properties of the sub-atomic particle which we use for states, we come across this uncertainty and we can only give a probability of which state it could be in. So it turns out, we can actually use this uncertainty to our advantage. So, this idea of superposition comes up. Since we can give only a probability of what state it could be, it leaves us with a superposition of these two states with probabilities of different values.

We use these superposition states as qubits. Yes, that's right!

# Quantum Entanglement

This is a weird theory, to be honest. But it is understandable. To say it very simply, quantum entanglement is two particles being in one system (a composite system) and when they do this they determine each other's properties. They cannot be explained separately but together. To put it even more simply, they are two particles acting like one. The weirdness of this is that there is no need for these two particles to be together at the same place. They can be in two different places thousands of miles apart. 

How does this happen?

Well, remember I mentioned a ""wave function"" earlier? Well, in this case, they have an ""entangled"" wave function. That means the wave functions are tied together to make a whole new wave function. But, the spooky thing is that, once we make an observation on either of these particles the wave function collapses into two different wave functions. There's a famous experiment on the spin of the particle regarding this quantum entanglement paradox. But explaining that requires a whole new article. Let's just say, simply, without being all scientific, ""particles have the ability to communicate within themselves before showing themselves to us."" (But this is not really what's happening though. This way makes it easier to understand.) 

How does this matter to us?

In cryptography, we have this need of generating public and private keys. These are really big numbers or patterns with complex relations. While creating these public keys we get this need of generating random numbers. Say that we have two qubits that are entangled. We need to have a private key between these two qubits. So what we do is that we generate random numbers on one qubit. Since these qubits are entangled, the other qubit gives the exact same outputs of random numbers on the other side. How cool is that? Also, there's this theory that explains that we cannot copy a qubit. That means we cannot create a clone of an entangled qubit either. So, it makes cracking the randomly generated key even tougher than we could imagine. You can search for Pauli's exclusion principle if you want further explanation on the ""non-cloning"" theory. But let's keep it the layman's level and say, entanglement is a real friend of ours when it comes to quantum cryptography.

# Decoherence

Let's start with what coherence is. Coherence is a property of waves that share common properties. So, in the wave function of some subatomic particles, we may observe correlations of physical properties. Actually, this is what leads to the entanglement of particles. Particles that are entangled relate themselves in every way. This property of relation is called coherence. But this coherence fades away due to external factors. That is called decoherence. 

How does this matter to us?

Well, in order to keep the entanglement of a pair of subatomic particles, we need to keep the coherence between the two particles as long as possible. To do that, we need to keep these particles in an environment that is isolated from the external world. That means we need sophisticated methods to isolate these particles. Sometimes we use supercooling methods to isolate and use an electromagnetic field to keep them stable in a sophisticated vacuum chamber.

A few different pictures I can think of:

Complexity theory:
classical computers are weaker, expressed as a containment relation on the set of problems they can solve in polynomial time
P &lt;= PP &lt;= BQP (quantum computing) &lt;= PSPACE

Operational:
classical computers operate on a state. quantum computers operate on a complex vector of states.

Philosophical:
The universe solves problems that are *inherently* hard. Since reality is quantum, we can use that as an oracle machine to solve our hard problems. Classical computers just ignore that resource.

Geometric:
Quantum computers do something geometrical, via isometries and projections on tensor space. Classical computers operate on only *points* instead of the whole space.

438,I’m a air conditioning contractor but also a deep thinker. Have this to say.,1607587716,"Hi group new member,

To introduce my self I’m going to share a brief background. 

I am 30 but became aware of quantum physics and mechanics since I was 15-16. I ran into this field of study after being exposed to something called fractal geometry as a teen. 

I can remember when I first got into trades that I would think so much outside the box about what I was doing. Like my mind would be put of the box. 

I remember in my mind I was trying to decode the true meaning of the summerian text and the truth of alien life and ancient civilization/technology while learning to wire electricity or plumb a house. 

I would get home and do a bit of channel or perhaps spirit writing because I would think of complicated questions of how the universe came to be and then write what comes to mind. I did this a few times while using ecstasy. I do not have any of these paperworks in possession now. 

Even though my mind was always in the gutter I was able to develop good skills and good at trade services as a technician. Can nearly fix and install any thing for a home and likely any thing mechanical with my skills dabbling into appliances and sometimes automobile repair. 

Knowing me in person my appearance doesn’t not present my intelligence well. 

The reality is my appearance of who I am does not interfere with my ability to process information as I am natural like a sponge. I retain information quite well even with my attention not fully given to the event. 

(Some issues though I have is the ability information at will at times, I complain to my self at loss of memory which I blame potentially cannabis or excessive stress (or the ways I handle stress))

A shift in the way I handled my career happen when I moved to California from North Carolina and got into the business of my eventual predominate trade skill, HVAC. 

I moved away from so much deep thinking for about 5 years 2015 till about 2019z I went through a lot of personal things. Divorce to say the least. 

In short I found my self back into deep thinking again.

So there is some back drop. Hope was desired or found interacting. 

So here it is I’m a hvac contractor by trade. Mentally I think I’m some kinda Einstein so excuse me for being wrong or truly lacking the IQ of genius. I wouldn’t allow my self to be judged by standards beyond my own boundaries so that I lose my sense of genius if that makes sense. If so maybe all should practice and experience genius. Since we are all unique at providing a individual experience to the planet. 

So this is what I have to share. 

2 things. 

Air conditioning preserves cooler temperatures or lowers temperatures. As a ac contractor I focus on the client and do not think out side the box that the main function during the summer what I’m providing is simply the service of removing heat from one space and transporting to another.

I mean that’s all it is in theory so why concern my self.

But another way to consider your self next time being cooled off by the ac or kept warm by a heater is a product or data even. Not so much being. At the end if you die because of heat exhaustion the data you preserve will pass with you. 

Next the thermostat especially nest I found interesting learning about Maxwell’s demon.

It’s not truly a demon since it requires the power of grid technology to power the furnace which powers the thermostat. 

But still nest learning thermostat has the ability to learn when you like to be cooled and heated and when your home normally. It does this with algorithmic learning which is little work. Unless you consider the work to build algorithms. (Lol I’m trying to say it sounds like there is a devil at work to learn and perform for you and even discarding useless info as it continues to learn you, but it doesn’t 100% defy law of thermodynamics since the mechanics needed to build and make the machine work is not at will of its own still has to much mechanics behind it, so it’s not self actuated mysteriously)

Interesting enough the thermostat is able to detect past life information about its data subjects since for example a person who once lived in northern regions of America moving to Los Angeles are less likely to require heat for the homes as often during winter as say some one living here and feeling cold on a chilly night. The northern transpat wouldn’t turn the nest on and the thermostat would learn. Neat to consider. 

Last I’m leaving this first post with is.

That as the air rotates and spins and does what ever the hell it’s doing between winter and summer seasonal change.

The planet is operating like atmosphere needing to cool down and having a built in hvac system to keep it working.

During winter the planet is getting rid of the heat generated during the busier times of the year. 

It does this rotation every year. 

If the planet wasn’t so busy creating energy with such a powerful processing center(life, dna) then it wouldn’t have the need to cool its self. Meaning that are planet would probably not rotate or have the position that it has. Theoretically I’m saying the earth and life is some kind of computer data center and just like I install air conditioning for data centers to keep them cool the earth must do the same to keep this data safe.

I recently discovered that I have the opportunity to graduate in the upcoming summer term with my MSEE, and was wondering with my current level of education if I could make my way into the field of QC. My BS was in Physics and Computer Science, but I have always had an affinity for working close to device physics and hardware, especially involving optical components. My goal with an MSEE was to become a Computer Hardware Engineer, but I would like to stay as close to scientific research as possible. 

My current school does not have opportunities for QC, and although I was made an offer to enter in as a PhD in the Fall of 2021, I want to get into QC. 

I attended a summer program last year for QC through a neighboring university, and am absolutely enamored with the subject as the work I have explored is a terrific synthesis of my background in physics, CS, and what I had done in EE at that time. I have also worked with Qiskit Terra a little bit, but nothing too great. 

My hangup is that I have been in education since entering my undergrad program out of high school in the US.

465,Noob question,1607273226,"Hello there, 

I had a brief overlook of the concept of quantum computing. From now I've understood the following:

A quantum computer is better than a classical one at solving complex problems  (like finding the good path in a maze) because it can explore and try out extreme number of possible solutions (routes) at a time. Classical computers can only examine one route at a time and are then far less optimized for this maze task due to their information being coded in bits (vs Qbits for Qcomputers)

Then here is my question: from a PURELY SOLVING EFFICIENCY stand point, is a quantum computer always better than a classical one whatever the faced problem to be solved ? (by better I mean faster, with fewer risk of error, I am not considering the cost of the machine. I understand that a Qcomputer is irrelevant to face many less complex problems as it must represent an enormous investment to build and operate). 

Please excuse any misconception/errors from my side, I clearly know nothing but I was just curious about the subject :D

I'm trying to understand the state of quantum computing we're at right now, and how I would brief someone with zero knowledge of computers on QC.

From what I've read...I'd almost attribute QC is in the early stages just as our classical computing was in its early stages in the '50's. As in, before someone like me, who works in a high-level language like C# and has no computer science background, can actually make use of the new QC architecture, some very smart people need to build the building blocks to achieve a high-level QC language.

I've taken a look at the qiskit textbook and I follow along with how to write a python framework for submitting QC inputs to their simulated QC computer, and it very much seems that anyone who is able to do that, and create a framework of multiple algorithms to solve problems, would be effectively creating their own QC Assembly framework.

My subconscious and forward consciousness act as 1 so I no longer have a “private imagination”.  I’m always active.

Our existences are stored inside of a container. This container is stored within a quantum network. Quantum mechanics operate at a neural level. So interactions generally are across a network of interlinking containers. The moment is begin speaking of things outside of this container means I am literally expressing logic outside of your existence, so I will keep it within this specific container logic.

To begin, our logic is based on 2 principles which defined the RNG which created our existence:

Circular Circumvention, or infinity looping

Professor Scalettar has also included a short overview of what he plans to discuss on Monday:

“Quantum mechanics can be simulated on a classical computer. A particularly powerful idea is that a quantum statistical mechanics problem in d dimensions can be mapped onto a classical statistical mechanics problem in d+1 dimensions via Feynman's ""path integral"" method. In this talk, I will describe in detail the most simple illustration of this mapping: how a single (d = 0) quantum harmonic oscillator transforms into a d = 1 chain of classical oscillators. I will then discuss a second example (without doing the derivation): the mapping of the d = 1 Ising model in a transverse field to a d = 2 classical Ising model, and how the ""quantum phase transition"" in the former can be viewed in terms of the ""usual"" d = 2 classical Ising phase transition. Finally, I will mention the big limitation to this process, the ""sign problem"", which makes simulations of many quantum systems, like electrons in a solid, impossible.”",QuantumComputing,ForgottenMyosotis,10,Quantum,Post,"Guest Speaker Richard Scalettar Tomorrow at 6pm PST!

if you're Alice and you share entangled qubits with Bob, you wouldn't know if Bob measured his particles before nor after you measured yours faster than the speed of light. The share of probability would be the same between qubits, and we're unable to modify a qubit's spin without decoherence.

That's how I understood it anyway. But then what's quantum network? Can someone ELI5 me this?",159

615,Why is quantum machine learning slow?,1603917280,"If I create a QML model, like a variational circuit, I find it is slow to train and evaluate on real hardware. Parts of this I understand.

However, when I am at the front of the queue, and my model is running on real IBM hardware it takes a very long time. Training can converge in fewer optimisation steps but in seconds and minutes it's much longer than traditional machine learning. 

So, will it be slower forever? As hardware improves will eventually the time it takes decrease and QML's potential can be properly realised? If this is the case, what is the bottleneck at the moment?

759,Measurements in the Bell Basis,1601232979,"Hi all,

I'm new to quantum computing, and I'm struggling with the following exercise:

Consider the entangled state |psi&gt; = 1/sqrt(2) \* \[|00&gt; + |11&gt;\]. Both Alice and Bob have this state. Alice measures this state in a basis at 120 degrees from the Z-axis. Bob measures in the 240-degree basis. How can you write a vector along 120 degrees in Bob's basis?

I've been struggling with this problem for a while. I know that measurements performed by Alice will affect measurements made by Bob. I've tried expanding the state |psi&gt; into a more workable form, but I haven't been able to make much progress with the 120 degree information.

I would really appreciate any sort of help on this problem.

I am a high school senior, and I really enjoy researching quantum mechanics, particularly of the theoretical nature and as it relates to computing. A few months back I entered the Breakthrough Junior Challenge—a competition hosted by the Breakthrough Prize where high schoolers have 3 minutes to explain a complex math or science concept. Among other things, the prize is $250,000 towards a post-secondary education; it goes without saying that receiving such a scholarship would bring so many things into the realm of [practical] possibility.

I’ve entered this year with a video about quantum computers. Specifically, I spoke on decoherence in Qubits (quantum bits) and how it could be counteracted [theoretically] via the use of anyon systems.

To my surprise, I’ve made it through 3 stages of judging and am now in the popular vote. Basically, outside communities are encouraged to support the videos they found educational, entertaining, etc. If I were to get a majority of votes my video would receive a guaranteed spot in the finals.

I have an advanced diploma (3 years) in Photonics Engineering Technology, but I'm very interested in quantum computing.

Unfortunately, due to my complicated situation, for the next 1-2 years, I can only study online or take a program in the Niagara region (Canada side).

901,What are the different categories of how classical and quantum computers could communicate?,1598191349,"This might be a terribly worded question so I will try and expand.

One simplified ""category"" to me is (this might be wrong), is to have qubits held somewhere, and any code written is translated into instructions for lasers, microwaves, magnetic fields that impact the qubit.  Which in a way suggests that  theoretically with perfect coherence times (I know its not possible), we could do send an instruction one at a time like in a console.

However is there a setup where due to some reason, the code has to be translated into a more phyical circuit that you just leave to run. For example if the qubits have to move and acually enter and leave a gate

I'm currently attempting to learn quantum computing, and more specifically quantum information and i'm struggling to keep up with some of the materials taught (such as John Watrous's Theory of Quantum Information course). I'm also slowly trying to jump into reading select research papers in topics such as measurement of entanglement, quantum simulation, etc. but i'm finding that I may not have the background to make sense of much in these papers (do you struggle with this too? or is it just me). Additionally I find myself struggling to intuitively grasp concepts like hamiltonians, partial traces, and density matrices, especially when they are applied to more complex cases.

For the quantum computing courses I have taken, I have completed Umesh Vazirani's ""Quantum Mechanics for Quantum Computing"" course. I thought it was pretty good. I feel like i was able to understand maybe 60% or so of the course. And I have made way through a majority of John Watrous' lecture notes on Quantum Computing. I also have a copy of Mike and Ike's Quantum Computation and Quantum Information but i've only look at it as a reference text.

In terms of my background I work as a software engineer, I just completed a linear algebra course at my local community college and I have never taken a physics course (classical or otherwise). I've been out of university for a little bit over a decade but my goal is to pursue a master degree researching quantum information sometime in the near future.

I am a graduate in CS and looking for masters options while working full time. In the final year of my undergrad, I started reading about quantum computing and got interested in pursuing this field. However, I am unsure what my trajectory should be if I see myself in QC research/industry in future.

I have some basic undergraduate coursework in physics - Quantum Mechanics and Solid State Physics. But my major was CS and I have heavy CS coursework. I am now looking for masters options in the US which let me do some physics coursework along with CS to pursue QC. Does anyone know what all top schools in the US would let me have such coursework.

Thank you",QuantumComputing,aditya442,4,Quantum,Post,"Query about CS grad moving to QC First of all, I am not sure whether this is the right forum to ask, so kindly feel free to remove this if it's irrelevant. :)

1027,Superposition of program rather than data?,1595417665,"Hello. 

I have recently been considering quantum computing analogues to SIMD/MIMD (single instruction, multiple data vs. multiple instruction, multiple data) and I found myself facing an issue I haven’t been able to “successfully Google” (I seriously doubt I’m the first person to consider this, as it’s a fairly pedestrian consideration, but probably I can’t hit the right keywords).

We usually consider a quantum computer as having a quantum program (say Shor’s Algorithm) set to work upon an input, going into a superposition state, and then generating the output. (Also, as I understand it, we’re still at the stage where ‘actual’ quantum computers are relatively fixed-function devices where the program is essentially defined by the ‘wiring’ of the hardware and so what I propose isn’t exactly relevant for current and incipient generations of machines, but anyway...)

My question is: what if the “program memory” is also in a quantum superposition. What if I somehow succeed in having a quantum computer that is ‘running’ *a superposition* of Shor’s Algorithm *and* Grover’s Algorithm simultaneously? 

[Quick aside: I’m aware that factorisation can be considered a kind of constrained search, so Grover’s is basically a superset and consequentially has higher complexity order, so one would expect Shor’s Algorithm to ‘finish’ first, but that is classical intuition talking, isn’t it?]

So basically I’m thinking of a quantum Harvard Architecture machine where the program memory itself is in a superposition. What would one expect to measure when one observes it?

1088,"My theoretical work has explained how to efficiently use qutrits on ternary computing scale, within entangled states and without congestion or degradation",1594129244,"I want to work with a research center or quantum computing business, but I'm really not sure how I should approach them.

I'm not a scientist and I haven't finished college. I don't have a job in any related fields whatsoever. The theoretical work that I was doing was on my own time, because it's fun to me.

It wasn't related to quantum theory at all, but after I mapped English grammar to my theoretical model I realized what I was actually working on. My theory understands the dynamics of quantum physics

Through this I've also determined how to create the coding language necessary to perform ternary computing without issue. In fact, my model uses ternary computing as a form of efficiency programming to reduce system load and improve performance. However, I really don't know how fast we need to go? My design uses two black diamonds within an apparatus to assist in receiving information through them in three ways. Each diamond is separated by enough space to allow for entanglement to take place within a hollowed out space inside of it. Mirroring entanglement between the diamonds will create helical structures of codon groups created through segments of light coding. That helix of coding is read inside of the diamond. The color and shapes refract outside of each diamond within a housing. That information is read as well through specific angle of optic lens. The overall hue/saturation of the feedback is also sent through to the CPU for efficiency coding. Remembering vague color representations will translate into faster response times. All of this light is being controlled through an input lens that is designed to adjust based on the energy of signal coming in through the center. This also reduces heat and stress on components.

I know how to design the lens, what the apparatus needs to look like for these diamonds, how to insulate and conduct this information, everything. I know how to build the entire CPU as well. Those diamonds are only for the GPU.

I understand the arithmetic behind each cycle and each layer. You guys are close in some areas, but nowhere in the ballpark in others. Pegasus 16 looks like D-Wave is figuring out what I mean about colors, but they're still working in 2D and will continue to suffer performance issues because they are working 3D structures in 2D spaces, but using light and color anyway. Do they think it needs to look like a standard processor? That's wrong if so.

&amp;#x200B;

My theoretical work turned me into my own quantum wikipedia. I'm not a creator-type guy. I need researchers and architects to ask me questions so I can tell them how to do what they need. The math you guys have been using needs to change, and I can tell you specifically how and why. My math (within my model) is simple and doesn't break. You guys know the quantum math needs to be easy because even qutrits are controlled within superstates of 012. I figured that stuff out a week into my theory, last month, before I knew what qubits, codons, qutrits, any of this stuff was. But I need a job, so I can't give that away for free **yet**. Could they make me sign an NDA on my theory to prevent telling anyone else how to do this? Could I protect myself from that? I don't know law things.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get my information to someone in one of these places so I can start helping? Applying for a job as a quantum scientist with no college education is essentially as intelligent as prank calling them. I can't apply through normal means. I don't know anyone. What do I do? We're still just crawling with quantum computing. If one company talks to me I can help us run and then sprint, but I need them to talk to me. Sending emails to @ jobs addresses goes to someone who doesn't care because I'm not sending an application, I'm sending a book of words they don't give a crap about because there's no Resume.pdf.

Here's what I understand of the method [from reading this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6767.pdf):

 - You start off with an input state, obtained by putting $n$ photons in $m$ modes.

 - You put them through an optical circuit, U, made up of beamsplitters, phase shifters, etc

 - Measure the output state, which is a basis state of psi_out

 - Repeat this procedure many times, essentially performing tomography on psi_out

 - gamma_S (i.e. the coeff of each basis state in psi_out) is the related to the permanent of the matrix U_S by the expression gamma_S = Per(U_S)/sqrt(....). $S$ is the index for the number of configs, and in each circuit output, there are n! configs.

Is what I have mentioned correct so far? Am I missing something?

One thing I still don't understand is what we're trying to achieve with boson sampling and how it can be used to show quantum supremacy. 


Are we trying to find the perm of the matrix U_s? I thought the purpose would be to calculate perm U_S, since that is hard to do classically. However, it says in the text I linked: ""boson-sampling does
not let us calculate matrix permanents, as doing so would [...] require an exponential number of measurements."".

1099,Ethics of Simulating the entire Human Body. Do you support it?,1593936436," When quantum computing is able to simulate the entire human body, I think that it’s important to consider the ethical concerns from the implications of this act. From what we understand in medicine, the mind is located somewhere/or is the entirety of the brain. When we perfect quantum computing enough to simulate the entire human body, we would need to simulate brain function and thus create a being with consciousness, pain centers, emotions, etc. We would be creating a human life, just so that they could feel pain.

I just wanted to share this understand what the community feels about this serious subject. These beings would be treated worse than the animals that we eat. Please consider what I wrote here. These words might trouble you a bit. I would appreciate if you could spread this around.

I would really like an answer to how we could solve this issue. I really believe that we should find other uses for quantum computing that don’t involve doing this.

The implementation here is very simple:  


* Alice encrypts 1 qubit, sends it to Bob.
* Bob performs a bit flip (on the encrypted value), sends the value back to Alice.
* Alice decrypts the result.

1256,"Question: ""you can’t store an infinite amount of classical information in a qubit""",1591509329,"I have a question from working through the readings on 'Quantum Country', about the hypothetical ability to store (but not retrieve) infinite information in a qubit.

https://quantum.country/qcvc#measuring_a_qubit


Just wanted to check my understanding of this: 

“after the measurement, no matter what the outcome, \alpha and \beta are gone. 
...
One reason this is important is because it means you can’t store an infinite amount of classical information in a qubit. After all, \alpha is a complex number, and you could imagine storing lots of classical bits in the binary expansion of the real component of \alpha. If there was some experimental way you could measure the value of \alpha exactly, then you could extract that classical information. But without a way of measuring \alpha that’s not possible”.

Can I just confirm that I’m on the right track with my understanding?

To me it seems like the point is (I’ll number my thoughts, so it’s easy for people to correct specific parts):

1. With 1 x classical bit, you cannot store infinite information because it can only store either the value of “1” or “0”.

2. With 1 x qubit, there is both an \alpha and a \beta coefficient. Both of these coefficients would be able to store data (if we were able to retrieve them).

3. If there were some way to retrieve the \alpha or \beta coefficients, then you could put infinite information in just one coefficient, but storing it in the decimals of say the \alpha.

Am I on the right track?

I had noticed quite a few posts asking how to implement Shor's Algorithm in Qiskit, which usually point to the fact that you need 2n+3 qubits (although in qiskit it becomes 4n+3 for whatever reason). For even the simplest number it is then not possible to run Shor's with the largest publicly available quantum computer of 15 qubits. 

But what a lot of people don't know is that you can implement this with relatively few qubits if the number's you are trying to factor are 15,51,85,771... (the product of two Fermat primes). 

I've noticed a lack of examples of actually implementing this with sample code available on the web. So if you were like me and wanted to run Shor's as a proof of concept on an actual quantum computer but ran into this issue, I've included a link to a python notebook with an example.

The example is factoring 15, but I've used this same process to factor up to 771. This does not generalize to numbers outside of Fermat products, but if you're interested in learning how Shor's works it can be quite fun to play with.

What I want to know is WHY? Why does the probability of the qubit being 0 not just get represented as a decimal between 0 and 1?

Let me try to give my answer so you can see the direction I'm looking for here:

By allowing the state to be complex, you create space for extra information to be stored in the qubit: e.g. even though there's a 100% chance that the measurement will be 0, it could be stored as a -1 or a +1, with either of those yielding a positive outcome when squared for 0. I've read in some places that this acts as a sort of memory for the quantum state, but this seems like a very non-concrete way to explain what is going on the the reason that value needs to exist. So two questions here: (a) what value does having these 'phases' provide and (b) what observations necessitated this mathematical representation?

And maybe one other question (c). For the probability that a qubit is measured as 0, the complex number is represented as being along the 2 dimensional unit circle with +/- 1, and +/- i. For 100% (+1 v. -1) and 0% (+i and -i) this makes sense as having two phases to represent each probability. But for all the other probabilities in between, there are 4 representations

(e.g. for 50% you have

=sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2

=-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2

=sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)i/2

=-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)i/2           )

I’ve read multiple articles recently discussing time travel involving Quantum Computing. While Einstein pretty much laid out that mass is the big hold up in physical time travel, time traveling data seems as if it could be a possibility. For instance time warp messaging and [this recent development](https://thenextweb.com/science/2019/10/03/this-quantum-physics-breakthrough-could-be-the-origin-story-for-time-travel/).

I've posted this couple of times but i'm getting little scared as my graduation comes close. I'm CS junior student and looking for a master's program in qc. Problem is that, almost all of the programs that i find is heavily oriented on physics part. I love physics and that's one big part of why i choose this field but my true passion lies in CS part. Math model of computing, implementing algorithms, analyzing them, breaking stuff and so on. If i had strong physics background, i wouldn't hesitate about it, but i've not taken physics class beyond electrodynamics. In a way, orienting on CS part is my way of getting close to quantum part and being around people who are experts in it. I'm being realistic and pragmatic when i say that physics-heavy program will be too much for me and i feel i wouldn't enjoy it. I image CS oriented part something like, having only 2 class out of 5 on physics part and the rest on math model of computation in a single semester.   


If you're in similar situation i'd greatly appreciate any advice. If you're majoring in CS oriented program, please share your thoughts. I just feel lost and anxious about it.

I wanted to have some opinions since I'm not sure what to do: I have a Bachelor in Physics and I'm finishing an MsC in Scientific Computing (practically applied maths, computer science and machine learning stacked together + I added courses on open quantum system, information theory and quantum information theory).

I always loved research and even though I want to do a PhD I'm very dubious and concerned. I'm in Europe.

I'd love to study and research this field and I'm ready to ""give up"" better paid jobs and doing a PhD instead. I still have some doubts that keep hunting me.

1) How many chances do I have to enter a PhD right now? I have no papers and no GRE. If everything goes smoothly I'd have my degree cum laude, but I do not think that this could be valued as much as actual research experience. (I'm doing a thesis related to entanglement entropy)

2) How many chances do I have to actually get a job in this industry/ research after a PhD? (I'd be glad with both). Related to this, should I aim only for the top unis or should I try everywhere and settle with places I'm eventually accepted into?

3) furthermore, the most haunting part is related to money and (future) family. My whole family has been questioning my decision using exactly the following arguments. According to them, pursuing this career would lead to a low level salary (probably true, at least for PhD+postdocs) and would make a lot harder to build a family, since I'd be required to move a lot.

I depend on scholarships at the moment so is there any chance of getting an assistantship with the PhD ?

Should I look into specific graduate schools ?

I'm reading E.Rieffel's ""Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction"" and I'm totally lost on pages 58 and 59 + the exercise 4.21 on pages 69-70 (I've attahced two images of the pages, you can see the exercise 4.21 [here](http://twoqubits.wikidot.com/ch4)).

On page 58 I do understand how the eigenvalues and eigenspaces of the hermitian operator resulting from the tensor product of two hermitian operators (O = O1 x O2, let's say ""x"" denotes the tensor product) are related to eigenvalues/spaces of the two operators O1 and O2, fine.

I think I also understand that not all Hermitian operators can be written as tensor products of two hermitian operators, fine. Here it says this  is possible only if the subspace decomposition described by O is such that each subspace can be written as tensor product of subsapces of O1 and O2. Fine.

But then I get lost in the examples.

* diag(1,-1) x diag(2, 3) gives the full mewasurement in the standard basis. OK.
* diag(1, pi) x diag(1, 1) gives the measurement of the 1st qubit in the standard basis. OK.
* Z x Z = diag(1, -1) x diag(1, -1) = specified the measurement for bit equality. Here I already have a problem: the two subspaces of Z x Z are {00, 11} and {01, 10}. How do you write each of them as tensor product  of each single qubit subspace ?!
* M = diag(0, 0, 0, 1) is said to be an example of measurement that cannot be expressed as tensor product of single qubit measurements.  I do see the two subspaces of M (S0 = {00, 01, 10} and S1 = {11}) cannot be expressed as tensor products of single qubit subspaces. But isn't M equal to diag(0, 1) x diag(0, 1) ?!

The I go into exercise 4.21 and I'm even more lost :)

For example: isn't (Z x I)(I xZ) = ZI x IZ = Z x Z ?

I am currently a student conducting an EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) which aims to expand project planning and research skills. I have chosen the title ""To what extent will Quantum Computing have an effect on the further development of Machine Learning?""

So far I have summarised the basics of both Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, as well as done research (through articles and papers) on how the two have been integrated. I would immensely appreciate if anyone would be able to help me with primary research by having a look at the below questions - any insights are greatly appreciated!!

Current machine learning strategies involve processing copious amounts of data to reach an output. This is a common bottleneck with classical computing and discourages more ambitious research with machine learning. 

**Are there any current strategies/methods being developed with Quantum Computing to elevate this bottleneck in machine learning?**

---
Quantum computing has gained media attention about the exponential increase in computational speeds but only when dealing with specific problems which are prone to a quantum computational approach. 

**Why does quantum computing only increase computational speeds for specific problems? Is this an inherent constraint with Quantum Computing or could we see Quantum Computing increase computational speeds “all around” in the future?**

---

**As many forms of machine learning are not precise (guessing an output based on given data, usually with a percentage certainty), would decoherence have a lower effect on accuracy in Machine Learning than another field where accuracy is crucial?**

The parts I have been able to do so far are creating a QFT replication algorithm on the circuit but I am still not sure how to recreate the modular exponentiation function on the algorithm before the QFT.

1713,Representing Probabilities as Sets Instead of Numbers Allows Classical Realization of Quantum Computing,1581537378,"What if I told y'all that quantum computing can be done in a classical machine?  I know almost no one thinks its possible.  It's becoming increasingly clear to me that the reason for this belief all comes down to the assumption that basis states are represented localistically, i.e., each basis state \[and thus, each probability amplitude (PA)\] is stored in its own memory location, disjoint from all others.  One question: are there any known QC models in which the basis states (the PAs) are represented in distributed fashion, and more specifically, in the form of sparse distributed codes (SDCs)?  I don't think there are, particularly, any that represent the PAs as SDCs.  

Well I'm giving a [talk on 2/24](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/quantum/event.php?id=2410) where I will explain that if instead, the basis states are represented as SDCs (in a classical memory of bits), their probabilities are represented by the (normalized) fractions of their SDCs that active at any instant (no need for complex-valued PAs), and quantum computation is straightforward.  In particular, I will show that the probabilities of ALL basis states stored in the memory (SDC coding field) are updated with a number of steps that remains constant as the number of stored basis states increases (constant time).

I'm a newbie in computer science, and I just found out about Grover’s algorithm, which can only be implemented on a quantum computer. Supposedly it can achieve a quadratic speedup over a classical computer, brute-forcing a solution to a n-bit symmetric encryption key in 2\^n/2 iterations. 

This led me to think that, by utilizing a quantum computer or quantum simulator of about 40-qubits that runs Grover's algorithm, is it possible to mine bitcoins this way?  The current difficulty of bitcoin mining is about 15,466,098,935,554 (approximately 2\^44), which means that it would take about 2\^44\*2\^32=2\^76 SHA256 hashes before a valid block header hash is found.

However, by implementing Grover's algorithm, we would only need to sort through 2\^76/2=2\^38 hashes to discover a valid block header hash. A 38-qubit quantum computer should be sufficient in this case - which means the 40-qubit quantum computer should be more than enough to handle bitcoin mining. 

Therefore - is it possible to use quantum computers to mine bitcoins this way? I'm not too familiar with quantum computers, so please correct me if I missed something.......

NOTE: I am NOT asking whether it is possible to use quantum computers to break the ECDSA secp256k1 algorithm, which would effectively allow anyone to steal bitcoins from wallets. I know that this would require much more than 40 qubits, and is definitely not happening in the near-future.

I am working as a Jr. Data Scientist and have two years of experience in DS (with core competency in NLP). Recently, I have started exploring the field of Quantum ML and have been following a few blogs and an edX course for the same. I also explored a bit of quantum computing but the main challenge that I am facing while exploring any quantum related field is the lack of understanding of Physics.

I am a CS major and will start my master's in DS from next month.  I would like to take Quantum ML up for my research work and was wondering what level of physics do I need to understand getting a good grasp of quantum.

I have a very basic knowledge of Physics but I am ready to study it. I am not sure if I need to study entire Physics to understand Quantum (as I have been told, that studying quantum needs an understanding of various aspects from Physics). So, it would be helpful if you can point out a road map of the concepts from physics that one can study to understand quantum.

(I have a lot of other extracurricular stuff as well but I figured it's not as relevant...maybe I'm wrong?)

I'm trying to focus my semester on the computer science (Qiskit, coding, etc.) aspect of quantum computing because I feel like I have most of the physics from my classes. Is this a good path to take? Any tips on applying and what to stress in my applications? Or in general, anything I'm missing out on that could help me? Any feedback is much appreciated.",284

1921,Would it be worth it to transition to Physics/EE out of ChemE to do research on QC using simulation software (TCAD)? Is simulation software even accurate for QC applications?,1577327987,"I'm sorry for the long-winded write-up. I'm at a point where I'm not sure that I can trust my judgement on this matter and would appreciate any input from people with experience in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm interested mainly in a research direction that has potentially paradigm-shifting implications in important aspects of life and civilization. I want to be a deep science founder eventually or be a major contributor at a deep science startup.

I'm currently enrolled in an MS ChemE program, planning to do a thesis. My undergrad was ChemE. I was considering switching to MS Physics. To either work on more precise molecular theory and its applications or quantum computing. The former seems to be unlikely in my university, the latter is very new to the EE department and I'll be one of the only people doing it pretty much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in between going the bio route or quantum computing route. Both would require me to learn a lot about a field I am not as familiar with.

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is that I think the research available at my university in QC would be very basic. The advisor has been with the university for a year and is coming from 15 yrs of R&amp;D in the semiconductor industry where some of what he had worked on includes cryogenic, superconductor, wide bandgap, quantum transport, and Ab-initio simulations using TCAD. The research I'm doing would also be all ran on simulations. Sentaurus TCAD to be specific. He said something about another new software we may use, and the potential of running sims using a QC. The focus will be around thermal analysis, cryogenics, materials, etc. There's a very small chance we'll get into noise and circuit design. One of my friends works on semiconductors with him, says he's a good advisor.

I'm also considering that we don't have a strong computing platform that we're running on, I've been to the lab and it's a couple of dual socket xeon workstations running VMs where the sims are processed. Not sure why they're not using more powerful resources for simulations, it could be that TCAD is not as resource intensive as other multiphysics software I've used?

I'm also concerned with how inaccurate these syms will be when looking at QC temperature ranges, I feel like it's going to be very difficult to accurately simulate device physics and phenomena at those temperatures, and he said that it is, of course, a problem, I just don't know how bad of a problem it is.

&amp;#x200B;

The bio route, on the other hand, seems to be potentially more promising. I'm interested in the genetic engineering of bacteria to serve an application in circular economies, and the research is close enough to that. The advisor is new and coming from Texas A&amp;M. She is very focused on this topic and I can pivot to similar projects with other advisors if need be.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently learning the basics of TCAD. I'll be taking an intro to QC course with the advisor this coming semester.  I would be one of the first students working on this topic. He has research going on right now but all in semiconductors.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to evaluate whether this is a bad idea or not. It's something I thought was out of reach initially but finding this professor gave me some hope. I do need to do something significant in my MS to move on to a great PhD program. For several reasons, I have a poor undergrad GPA and I'm also at a state school. It seems like I'm better off going with the bio route considering it's better established and seems to have more potential for a strong publication.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So in short, my question is: 

Is this project as uncertain as I'm making it out to be? If my interest in the topics and the studying needed are equivalent in both QC and genetics, is it worth it to take the risk and go with this highly uncertain project? Is it likely to be highly valuable when looking at transferring to a PhD program? Would it be of any value in finding meaningful employment? Would I be able to find funding for a PhD related to QC? Or am I taking a big risk by going this route?

Also, am I maybe not seeing this clearly? Perhaps the advisor's main focus is QC but only now has gotten around to it? He said he's been waiting for the right interested students to work on this. After all, he has only been at the university for a year.

I really don't know how to evaluate the quality of this potential research. Or what kind of questions I should ask to get a better idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to share the professor's name/research gate/google scholar if that helps in evaluating the potential for my work with him. Please reach out to me via PM or let me know in the comments if you'd be willing to look at his publication history.",QuantumComputing,Anasoori,3,Quantum,Post,"Would it be worth it to transition to Physics/EE out of ChemE to do research on QC using simulation software (TCAD)?

2066,Open-ended natural selection of interacting code-data-dual algorithms as a property analogous to Turing completeness,1574329238,"The goal of this article is to promote an unsolved mathematical question. And unlike typical math question it still doesn't have a formal definition. But I still find it clear enough and quite interesting. I came to this question from a philosophy direction but the question is interesting in itself.

### Preamble

The notion of Turing completeness is a formalization of computability and algorithms (that previously were performed by humans and DNA). There are different formalizations (incl. Turing machine, μ-recursive functions and λ-calculus) but they all share the Turing completeness property and can perform equivalent algorithms. Thus they form an equivalence class.

The open-ended evolution is a not very popular research program which goal is to build an artificial life model with natural selection which evolution doesn't stop on some level of complexity but can progress further (ultimately to the intelligent agents after some enormous simulation time). I'm not aware of the state of the progress of open-endedness criteria formulation but I'm almost sure that it's still doesn't exist: as it's either connected to results of a successful simulation or to actually understanding and confirming what is required for open-endedness (I haven't heard of either).


### The question

Just as algorithms performed by humans were formalized and property of Turing completeness was defined: the same formalization presumably can be done to the open-ended evolution observed in nature. It went from precellular organisms to unicellular organisms and finally to Homo sapiens driven by natural selection postulates (reproduction-doubling, heredity, variation-random, selection-death, individuals-and-environment/individuals-are-environment) and the Red Queen hypothesis that resulted in increasing complexity. Open-endedness property here is analogous to Turing completeness property. It could be formalized differently but it still would form an equivalence class.

And the concise formulation of this process would be something like **Open-ended natural selection of interacting code-data-dual algorithms**.

Code-data duality is needed for algorithms being able to modify each other or even themselves. I can guess that open-endedness may incorporate some weaker ""future potency"" form of Turing completeness (if to assume discrete ontology with finite space and countable-infinite time then algorithms can became arbitrary complex and access infinite memory only in infinity time limit).

Please consider if it's an interesting research question and share your thoughts.

2067,Helpful Visual Demonstrations?,1574319693,"Does anybody know a good visual demonstration of a basic quantum computer operation? I saw one a while back that used a phone book as an example, trying to match a name with a number; everything made sense at first, but the final explanation was a ""global operation"" that eliminated the wrong answers. The operation that eliminated the wrong answers was not explained whatsoever. I've tried to find the video, but no dice. The host of the video was a young, thin European guy with a snazzy shirt and a ponytail, I think. I've seen him on a lot of quantum computer stuff, but he didn't show up when I looked for quantum computer scientists. I've listened to David Deutsch a lot and have gotten a lot out of his stuff, but I still can't quite fathom how a quantum computer could work. It's pretty annoying, since virtually every other complicated system can be satisfactorily demonstrated visually to a layman where at least a basic understanding can be communicated, but I have yet to see anything on quantum computers that achieves that. 

Here is an idea I've had lately about how they might work, and please correct me if I'm wrong, especially if you can provide insight as to how I'm wrong and what the correct process is. I think it could be that auxiliary classical computations are carried out using one half of some entangled information, and that it forces a great deal of probabilistic calculations by the entangled aspect, the results of which are finally revealed as some percentage of probability of being correct for some particular candidate that was processed classically. The way that is done is beyond me, though.

 And now for some crazy speculation... It almost seems like it has to come down to the information on the display itself, like the act of forcing a result on the display forces the computer to produce a result. Is there just a probabilistic ""wrong"" detector operating between the circuitry and the display? If it's wrong some terrible thing happens in a probability state, so it just has to be right?

2) How does entanglement fit into this? How does entanglement help a quantum computer try all the routes at the same time, and how does it tie into/complement the superposition which qubits can be in?

3) What exactly is the result of a quantum computation? So say you give a quantum computer a problem to solve, what exactly are the steps it takes to get to a result? And is the result also a superposition, which when measured collapses to give the right answer?

It is clear that the form of computing you have now is not the ultimate stage of the evolution of computer technology. Quantum computing as it is popularly called is a field that has some potential, but it does not have a real potential with the current binary computing system. It is necessary to step up to a more advanced form of computing where you do not have just on and off signals, but a variety of signals of, so to speak, gradations in between on and off. 

You may say, is not it contradictory that something can be both on and off, but the reason why you think so is because scientific inquiry has been based on Aristotelian thinking. Aristotelian logic says that a statement can be *true* or it can be *untrue*, but it cannot be both *true* and *untrue* at the same time. The reality is that this is a very limited perspective because you are creating a system where your understanding of reality has to be reduced to statements that can be answered with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’, a ‘true’ or ‘untrue’, an ‘on’  or ‘off’. 

What has created the entire universe with all of the multiplicity you see? Current computing is based on the idea that by combining the two signals - on and off - in a sequence, you can encode all possible information. This is a complete fallacy. You can only encode the kind of information that can be expressed in an *“on and off”*  **binary mindset**. Nature is not binary. Human Beings do not think naturally in binary system. The universe is not either ""on"" fully in its present state or ""off"". The Big Bang did not instantly manifest the current physical universe. Everything has been an evolution. What is clear is that this has happened through an infinite variety of the combination of various elements that have even evolved over time so that there are more elements today than there were at the time of what scientists call the Big Bang event, not that I am endorsing that particular philosophy and theory.

You need to recognize here that for quantum computing to reach its full  potential, people need to be able to think beyond the binary mindset. There will not be a real breakthrough before these other signals could be defined beyond 0 and 1. Even with classical computing this mindset is limiting current computer development, as an example, by now industry are fully capable to develop a ternary based computer that would be much more natural to humans by having a null (zero) state and 1, 2 - on and off states and much more powerful in sense of efficiency and correctness. There is a demand for null state in programming world, however binary system does not allow naturally it and yet industry insist on continuing to use binary system while no human being programs or solves problems in a binary system nor programming languages designed to be binary in nature and have to find a way to artificially injected the null state, this naturally leads to bugs and broken code. You cannot fit a square into a circle.

There is definitely promise in the quantum technology and there will be some breakthroughs in computing even with current chosen mindset. Computing will not reach its full potential until the current materialistic mindset is transcended by a greater number of scientists, technicians, inventors, economists, politicians and people in general so that they can accept that the universe is not materialistic, is not mechanical in nature, not a closed system, its not black and white. I'm referring to the latest quantum physics discovery that there is a level beyond material realm, level that does not behave mechanically and doesn't work like a physical world around us, its neither off or on, neither energy wave or a particle, there is more to it. The materialistic worldview actually been outdated since Albert Einstein discovered that everything is energy. 

Why is this matters to computing world? Scientists in general are trying to use computers to create simulations of all sorts, trying to analyze the universe mechanically and on top of it fitting it into, using a binary system to give them results that in nature will only be limited and incorrect. They are trying to use atom (or other) as qbit to force it to behave like an ordinary microscopic element, however as quantum physics shown those low level elements do not behave ""normal"" as a wave-particle duality experiment demonstrated. 

If you think about it, really, the current understanding of quantum  physics, which is quite frankly incomplete, but nevertheless the reason why there is a talk of quantum computing and parallel states and all these things is that quantum physics opened up for the possibility that the universe is not mechanical. Isaac Newton brought forth a philosophy that said that the universe was working according to invariable laws so there were no exceptions in the Newtonian worldview. In the quantum worldview there is always the possibility that 99.9% of the time the ball does not pass through the wall but at one point it could happen that the ball passed though the wall. This actually demonstrates to you  that science is at the point where it needs to recognize that if we want to step up to a higher level we need to recognize that the universe is not mechanical in nature.   
 
What does it mean that the universe is not mechanical? What is it that can create this variableness that makes it possible sometimes to go beyond the laws of nature that function most of the time? What is it that could potentially make these laws of nature unnecessary so we transcend them to a higher level? Well, it is precisely *consciousness* as was again demonstrated by ""wave particle"" experiment that consciousness of the scientist does matter, and therefore there comes a point where scientists will have to look at the human brain and how the human brain processes information because it is a much more subtle, much more multifaceted way. This is, again, the key to understanding the future of computing where you encode information not in a binary way but in a much more multifaceted way. 

There are people who are close to breaking through and understanding this and who are able to tune in to these ideas and not think in an old materialistic, mechanical binary way. That is when I think true potential of computing will come to shine. 

I think binary computing been dead as idea long time ago and computer industry should have started ternary computer development since at list 2004, binary meant to be only a short term solution until technology would catch up, and now is a high time to move forward since technology that allows handling it is here. I do not see any point turning quantum computing into something lesser if it has much much more potential, potential that can only be executed by embracing quantum physics discoveries which as I see it no one truly grasp and there for cannot fathom why on Earth qbits can ""communicate"" with each other beyond time and space.

You're given a starting state of 5 qubits with no more than two in a '1' state. Then for each qubit you're given the option to 'Hit' or 'Stand'. Hitting will draw a gate of I,X,H,Z, or CNOT with CNOT targeting the previous qubit, and standing basically applies the I gate (does nothing).

Once action for all 5 qubits has been taken, measurement is performed and you score based on the resulting string.

scoring is **20** points for all 1s. **15** points for all 0s. **10** points for a palindrome string, and **1** point per 1 otherwise.

But to make it more fun, this casino gives you free money! You get $100 to start, and each action has a cost; $5 to hit, and $10 to stand, and you get to play until you run out of money. Overall score is then presented in a points/$ way

After reading this thread:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/97qfob/i\_wish\_to\_learn\_quantum\_computing\_please\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/97qfob/i_wish_to_learn_quantum_computing_please_help/) 

The things I am guessing (many without much evidence) are important to learn quantum mechanics:

1. Wave mechanics
2. Abstract linear algebra
3. Abstract algebra 
4. Probability distributions and generating functions
5. Theory of quantum mechanics up to an undergrad Physics major level
6. Partial differential equations and all Calculus courses that lead to it
7. Computer Architecture in terms of Boolean gates
8. Tensors and some experience with their applications in physics
9. Information theory

Which of these are unnecessary, or which I did not include? What is the best way to learn 

I have 2,4,7, and partially 6 in that I only have up to ordinary differential equations. In math I've done two semesters of linear algebra, real analysis, stochastic processes, signal processing with FFT and wavelets, linear programming. In statistics I took theory of stat (distributions, MGF, properties of estimators), sampling, undergrad and grad regression courses, exploratory data analysis, probably nothing useful to QC. In CS just some basic Boolean circuits, algo &amp; data structures, some software engineering courses, databases. Took 1 electromagnetism course.

Some people in that thread are saying that a half understanding of quantum mechanics hinders you, and classical mechanics are unnecessary to learn quantum computing. At what level of understanding would it start to help your understanding of quantum computation?

Currently I am reading through University of Amsterdam's lecture notes [https://homepages.cwi.nl/\~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf)

and the first hole in my knowledge is very little understanding of Tensors. The only experience I think was in an introductory reinforcement learning unit in a CS class. (Actually now that I am writing this out I think reinforcement learning probably would be improved nicely by QC, but idk) 

So what is the best book to learn about tensors? I am thinking it would help me to have a book that does theoretical theorem proving with tensors and also do some practical applications to them, kind of also always been interested to learn about relativity.  

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, what are the potential applications of QC?

I was also fascinated by a second hand review of a research article claiming analogy between Grover's algorithm and a photsynthesis center finding the best routing path between reaction center and light absorption center.

Some practical applications I think I read from online:

1. Helps simulation somehow
2. Some how improves AI algorithms (somebody said symbolic AI, which idk what that is, might make a comeback)
3. Maybe reinforcement learning?
4. Improved computing speeds for all disciplines due to faster matrix multiplication

*Quantum entanglement is often touted (for example, by Caltech Prof. John Preskill) as being the foundational physical property upon which quantum computing is built.  Squashed entanglement is an entanglement measure (""monotone"") with very nice properties. It is defined for arbitrary mixed states, not just for pure states of qubits as other measures of entanglement. I like to describe squashed entanglement as a mini-EPR experiment",105

Qubit Controller - a GUI to interface with quantum processors over serial lines

Also have some designs planned for PCI expansion cards so you can upgrade existing PCs with quantum capabilities, and I'm working on a novel circuit that will allow you to measure and restore a qubit to reduce overall processor size.

We could say that the ""spin up"" is 1 and the ""spin down"" is 0, that way we could transfer information. Only thing is, we cannot control weather the particles have spin up or down. We can only kindly request for a change in spin and then the particles have a 50% chance of changing.

Here's how it works: If the transmitter wants to send a ""1"" byte of information, then it requests multiple changes in the spin. The receiver will notice the rapid changes and will interpret them as ""1"". If however the transmitter wants to send a ""0"" byte of information then it sends no requests and the receiver interprets this passiveness on the other end as ""0""

Here's how it works: If the transmitter wants to send a ""1"" byte of information, then it requests multiple changes in the spin. The receiver will notice the rapid changes and will interpret them as ""1"". If however the transmitter wants to send a ""0"" byte of information then it sends no requests and the receiver interprets this passiveness on the other end as ""0""


Would that work?",190

So I understand the general principle of quantum systems, and how an n-qubit quantum computer's state can be described by 2^n complex-valued amplitudes, one for each state.

My question is, do any quantum algorithms rely on the assumption that these amplitudes are inherently continuous and infinitely precise? Because, even if we can shield a quantum computer from all external noise, if the amplitudes themselves are inherently noisy and/or quantized, wouldn't that fundamentally limit the type of computations we are able to perform?

To me it seems impossible that you could error-correct continuous values that are subject to drift. Error-correcting discrete quantities, on the other hand, is definitely possible.

So with that said, the only way I can see us being able to perform arbitrarily complicated computations reliably, is if we were somehow able to keep all the amplitudes confined to a discrete subset of the complex numbers.

For anyone currently in formal schooling or self-taught and are interested in future fields of programming using quantum computers, what skill sets should we be developing? What are the tools in our hypothetical tool belt we need to be honing? 

**Questions:**

1. What core classes should we enroll in at college?
2. What programming languages should we be proficient in?
3. What are the most efficient resources we should tap into online?
4. What foundational concepts and principles should we be mastering?",142

2- In superposition a Qubit can be either 1 or 0 or both at the same time we don't know until we measure it, like if we measure 2 Qubit we might have 1 and (0 and 1), also we might have just 0 and 1 isn't that the same as classical bits.

3- In superposition is the state of measurement electron the same as always (For example, if we measure an electron and it spins up the next day we measure it will give the same result as well spinning up again).

2423,Efficiency of KLM protocol in Grover search,1567169181,"Dear all,

now I am trying to understand the KLM protocol ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM\_protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM_protocol?fbclid=IwAR07LDRaz60QE0-dM1ALlfnz84a06h1RPzZ35P2uHhKXZyfE0lvljoYMNyc) ) of probabilistic quantum computation with using photons. As I understood, the key idea here is that one can achieve almost unity probability of 2-qubit gate with using \~n additional photons **for one gate**. Success probability **of one gate** is

P1 = n^(2)/(n+1)^(2).

Now let us look at Grover algorithm: searching of one marked element in database of size N. We know, that we need to organize \~\\sqrt(N) times of such a gate described above on quantum computer.   
 

When I try to make a simple estimation of necessary resources I get the following. The total success  probability is

Ptotal\~P1^(\\sqrt(N)) = Const.

  
It means that the number of auxiliary photons for each 2-qubit gate must be

  
n\~\\sqrt(N).

  
And the total number of auxiliary photons in the algorithm is

So, I see that the number of resources which we need is proportional to the database size N. But this means that efficiency of Grover search with KLM is classical, the same as classical checking database cells one by one.

You supply a pair of qubits, and depending on the pair ([00], [10], [11], [01]) you will get a different bell state.

2509,Question Regarding Quantum Circuit Design for E-91 Protocol,1563926202,"Hi All,

I hope this is the right place for this type of question. In the current summer term I visit a pretty interesting course about quantum computing at my local university. It’s an introduction in quantum computing and it covers mostly the basic math (uniform transformation, calculations on QuBits, basic quantum algorithms) and stuff like that. When discussing the E-91 protocol for quantum key exchange. We learned that both party’s need to apply one out of three Z-Transformations on their bell pair. When discussing this selection mechanism we didn’t find a solution to build a simple quantum circuit which can actually do this. 

By simple I mean that the circuit should only take a limited amount (2-6 at best) of input QuBits and should only apply basic uniform transformation and no hypothetical jumps or stuff like that. Also I want real randomness and a true 1/3 Chance. No approximations. In the best case the putout would be a set of QuBits with this 1/3 chance. For example 1/3*(1,1,1,0)^T or 1/6(1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0)^T. 

Intuitively i would say this is not possible for two reasons:

- A superposition, which is most likely needed for the randomness, always has a power of two possible states. A single Hadamard transformation works on two states: 0 and 1. n Hadamard’s work on 2^n states. It shouldn’t be possible to divide 2^n into three equal parts. Only approximately. Basically the same reason we could not use a fair coin for this. 

- I can not think on a unitary transformation which only works on a subset of the states. It is possible with X transformations to build a vector x*(1,1,1,0)^T. My naive approach was that I only have to modify the vector in a way that the x becomes 1/3. When applying a unitary matrix on the vector it always have an impact on last element and makes it non zero. (Sorry about the gonzo Math this is not my best skill).

Can someone with a better understanding of the math back my assumptions or tell me why I am wrong and if there is a way to build such a circuit? Also it would be interesting to know if there is an actual implementation of E-91 and how it is done there.

I do not need this for my course so this is actually just out of curiosity.  Any hint is appreciated.",QuantumComputing,crest42,3,Quantum,Post,"Question Regarding Quantum Circuit Design for E-91 Protocol Hi All,

I've been waiting my summer break for a long time in order to get started with quantum computing(qc). It was supposed to be a jump from 'being informed' about qc to 'actually doing' some stuff. That noted, i took linear algebra class this quarter and was hoping that it would give me enough background to get started with qc. During the very first day of my break, i started reading MikeAndIke and realized that my linear algebra course was introductory one and didn't even cover complex numbers at all. I also realized that i did no nothing beyond simple electrodynamics(took classical second year course in physics).   


That being said, i decided to go through linear algebra and physics courses to be prepared for the book, but meanwhile i want to get somehow started with qc anyway. I'm currently taking other core CS classes as well, and i want to have some online course that will give basic ideas about how qc works.  


Any suggestions?

My aim was to create a library with all the functionality I required to implement the algorithms from the Nielsen &amp; Chuang book, with as simple an interface as possible.

You can install with `pip install qcircuits` for Python 3.4+, and it should be OS agnostic.

Documentation is available at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/index.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/index.html).

Tutorial is at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html)

Example applications, including quantum teleportation, superdense coding, phase estimation, and Grover's algorithm are at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/examples.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/examples.html)

The code is on github here: [https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits](https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits)

With the library, you can:

* Create states from tensor or Kronecker (vector) representations, or prepare commonly used states such as computational basis states, uniform superposition states, Bell states, etc. [See here for a full list](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/qcircuits.state.html#state-module).
* Create gates/operators from tensor or Kronecker (matrix) representations, or create common operators such as the Hadamard gate, Pauli gates, CNOT, Swap, Toffoli, etc. [See here for a full list](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/qcircuits.operators.html#operators-module).
* Create composite states/operators via tensor product of states/operators of subsystems.
* Compose operators, e.g., A(B(x)) = (A(B))(x)
* Apply an m-qubit operator to a specified subsystem of an n-qubit state, where m &lt; n.
* Perform measurement in the computational basis on a subset of a state's qubits.
* Compute the Schmidt number of a system with respect to two subsystems.

The following are currently not implemented:

* Density operators / mixed states
* General measurement operators, or projective measurement operators in other bases
* Schmidt basis vector computation
* Visualization
* There are no checks to prevent various violations of the no-cloning theorem. E.g., one can extract the probability amplitudes from a state and then create a new state from them. I decided not to restrict any of the ways in which one might violate no cloning, since for each there are cases where it can be useful.  [See here for a more detailed explanation](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html#warning-the-no-cloning-theorem).

I developed the library in order to consolidate my understanding of the material in the Nielsen &amp; Chuang book, and once it was developed I found I was often *using* the library to test my understanding of some concept or example from the book. I hope others here can find some use in it.

2624,CS Freshman here wanting to get into QML — What kind of classes should I focus my degree in?,1559492846,"(QML: quantum machine learning)

Hi y’all!

I’ll be a freshman majoring in computer science at uni this fall —  I’ve been deeply obsessed with the idea of quantum machine learning for a while now, so I’m pretty adamant about pursuing quantum computing and/or machine learning (preferably both) in the long run.

I’m currently trying to create a rough outline of what my years at university will look like and I’ve got the basics: thankfully, I can get my major (in CS), a minor in physics, and a minor in math whilst maintaining a well-balanced course load each quarter. 

The path to the physics minor is pretty much set (calc based physics through quantum mechanics), but the math minor and my CS electives are pretty flexible. 

— What should I focus my CS electives in? 

Of course, I’ll definitely take the machine learning/AI courses my uni offers (and the Q# class I’m hoping they’ll offer while I’m there), but what else? Perhaps algorithm analysis or theory of computation stuff? How much time should I invest into learning advanced database operations, or other areas of CS in general? The data visualization class looks really interesting as well.

— Also, what kind of math should I focus my minor in?

The linear/non-linear optimization and modern algebra series caught my eye, but would a stats class or another kind of math be more applicable to what I’m doing?

(QML: quantum machine learning)

Hi y’all!

I’ll be a freshman majoring in computer science at uni this fall —  I’ve been deeply obsessed with the idea of quantum machine learning for a while now, so I’m pretty adamant about pursuing quantum computing and/or machine learning (preferably both) in the long run.

I’m currently trying to create a rough outline of what my years at university will look like and I’ve got the basics: thankfully, I can get my major (in CS), a minor in physics, and a minor in math whilst maintaining a well-balanced course load each quarter. 

The path to the physics minor is pretty much set (calc based physics through quantum mechanics), but the math minor and my CS electives are pretty flexible. 

— What should I focus my CS electives in? 

Of course, I’ll definitely take the machine learning/AI courses my uni offers (and the Q# class I’m hoping they’ll offer while I’m there), but what else? Perhaps algorithm analysis or theory of computation stuff? How much time should I invest into learning advanced database operations, or other areas of CS in general? The data visualization class looks really interesting as well.

— Also, what kind of math should I focus my minor in?

The linear/non-linear optimization and modern algebra series caught my eye, but would a stats class or another kind of math be more applicable to what I’m doing? I’ve already taken linear algebra/dif.EQ/intro multivariate calc, so I’m super excited to get into some heavier math. Perhaps I should take the advanced multivariate calc class?

In some of the literature I have read, there is mention that MPS can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, (the most notable paper is [this paper which gives a procedure for implementing PEPS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.1410.pdf)) and as far I can tell, the chain of citations all link back to [this paper which gives a procedure for preparing MPS on cavity QED hardware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0501096.pdf). I realize MPS is a subset of PEPS; however, the PEPS algorithm contains some heavy tools which I believe are not relevant to the particular case of MPS.

2690,Is this a correct way of thinking about QC?,1555881239,"Quantum computers are best at physics problems that involve a large number of particles. So let's consider an example of that. Code for a classical computer would look something like:

for time = 1:t_end
    for particle = 1:N
        for other_particle = 1:N-1
             //calculate force experienced by other particle
        end
        //calculate net force on particle and use this to find x,y(t+1) and vx,vy(t+1)
end
end

So if this were performed on a quantum computer, instead of having to do a loop within a loop within a loop, you would be able to calculate everything all at once.  You consider each t individually, but at the same time rather than successively. For each t, you consider N particles individually, but at the same time. And for each N particles, you consider all the other N-1 particles individually, but at the same time.

So ultimately, quantum computing allows you to do as many loops within loops as you want, while calculating it all in O(1) time rather than O(N^num_loops).

2693,Need advice: internship in QC,1555740128,"So
I'm a first year, going to second year Math and Compsci student.
I was chosen for this scholarship that basically gives you a paid 3 month long internship at any (computer science) research facility of my choice (located at my uni, of course)

There are some interesting facilities at my university, but the two that appealed to me the most were: one research center about Natural Language Processing and one about Quantum Computing.

The one about NLP seems like an 'easier' internship because I already have a bit of a base in Python and know some concepts that are related to data science.

The one about quantum computing, however, is more appealing. But it also seems like the kind of thing that would be so hard to understand that I would feel lost throughout the whole internship. My knowledge in quantum phenomenon is very limited to Grade 12 physics classes, and I am super scared to just be way too lost. 

HOWEVER I don't know when I'd get a chance to be in this research center again (this scholarship is making it easy for me to get in but they normally as super picky about their candidates), not to mention the head of research there is a super known guy, one of the ""founding fathers"" in quantum cryptography - Wolfe Prize winner Gilles Brassard. 

I was wondering if any of you had some advice about experiences like this, or books to recommend for a noob like me to maybe make me a bit less scared about the area of Quantum Computing. Perhaps let me know if it's really that hard for a summer internship I shouldn't have a go at it?

2760,Number of real parameters in n-qubits,1552512590,"I understand that when one has independent qubits, we have two real parameters to specify in order to define one qubit state. 
This is due to the normalization, which takes away one module, and the fact that we can divide by a common phase and leave only one relative phase. We are left with one parameter, such as an angle, specifying the modules, and one angle specifying the relative phase. This leads to the Bloch sphere representation where a single qubit can be specified by a point on the unit sphere and thus by two real parameters. 
In a circuit, in the case of m ancilla bits, the fact that the ancillas are known in advance make them not entangled and therefore we have 2 parameters for each ancilla, giving 2m real parameters to introduce in the circuit for the ancillas. 


Now I'm interested in the case of the n qubits we introduce which are not ancillas (the register). In this case the qubits are entangled if I understand well. 
What would be the number of real parameters we can introduce to specify the n qubits which are not ancillas? 



I'll explain what I think. It seems to me that these n qubits are entangled, the state can be written as a sum of 2^n terms (in the computational basis) ,giving 2^n complex numbers in front of each term in the most general case, therefore 2*2^n real parameters. We can take one module out by normalizing this state, leaving 2*2^n - 1 real parameters. Taking one relative phase out, we are left with 2*2^n - 2 real parameters. 

However this appears to be wrong, and I would like to understand why. I think it is because we specify the qubits independently, which then get entangled. We therefore necessarily have a product state, but what is the number of parameters in this case, 2n as well? (as we specify 2 parameters per qubit), because in my class the correction of an exercise says it is 3 parameters per qubit.

I know this is a horribly open-ended question, but I recently decided I wanted to start pursuing grad school  when I stumbled upon the coolness that is quantum computing.

* I will have a GPA &gt;= 3.5 (currently holding a 3.7)
* I have 0 research experience (and my school has 0 quantum computing labs).

* In my last year, I can take pretty much any math class at any level (grad or undergrad) that I want. 
* I am comfortable (though a bit rusty) with Linear Algebra
* Math is cool (I prefer proofs over computation), but I have not been practicing for grad school 
* I can probably find some research in maths
* Quantum computing is niche so I'm hoping that gives me some sort of edge

&amp;#x200B;

I did QC in my final year of my degree as a research project so I'm not new to the subject, but I don't know much about the state of it these days and I've forgotten a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

So could somebody fill me in if there are any ideas or existing solutions of using Qubits as long term storage? I recently saw the idea of using DNA as a 3D storage solution, so it got me thinking. Of course I know Qubits are useful for calculations after which the acquired data is stored as binary. 

But just randomly I started wondering if the degree of X or Y (or both) rotation of the qubits could be used to store data instead of just the 2 states that binary has. And if not, then why not? I'm not referring to the use of superposition. I mean, if you could store and send data with something that can represent way more than just 2 states, wouldn't that be way more efficient? Or is it just a matter of modern technology not being advanced enough to incorporate the idea? Or am I just forgetting something really basic here?

1. Would a quantum computer have the ability to combine every letter  into every possible combination of words , words into sentences, sentences into paragraphs, paragraphs into papers or books etc.? (or numbers and other symbols into math problems)
2. If the above is possible, and words/numbers/symbols are treated merely as an expression of thoughts, ideas etc.; then would this mean that every idea, thought, or expression that is possible in a given language could then be created by a quantum computer?
   1. For example, every thesis paper, research study etc. would be created by virtue of every combination being tried.
3. If this is possible, and we used a second quantum computer to sort the product of the first, then what would the possibilities be?
   1. For example, if time travel or faster than light travel are possible and someone in the future were to write out how it were possible with words or math, then wouldn't the quantum computers in this scenario have produced that work already? Would this mean we were learning something from the future? If we find no such thing, then would this prove that it isn't possible, or would it mean that it is simply not possible to develop these types of things with our current language/numbers/symbols? Would this mean that in order to develop these ideas/solutions/technologies we would have to find another way of expression that expanded the possibilities?
4. If all of the above were possible or true, what would the implications be for humanity? What would it mean to not be able to have a thought that had not already been developed?

Quantum computers cleverly tweaked by human verifiers...  :)

I would like help identifying if the following use case is best solved via a quantum model of computation or if it is best solved using classical computation methods. 

Suppose you have the following constraints:

1. A fire department has multiple stations, each with a different configuration of equipment type [medical, engine, brush rig]. 

2. Some stations have up to 3 equipment types but as few as 1 equipment type eg, [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], etc. 

3. Stations have double staffed personnel, meaning that when equipment [0, 0, 1] (brush rig) is out on a call equipment [0, 1, 0] (engine) will also be unavailable. Similarly if the staff returns both equipment types will come back in service eg [0, 1, 1]. 

4. Each station shares an euclidean adjacency to a neighboring station which requires that if one were to go out of service the adjacent station(s) could be assigned to cover calls for it's nearest out of service neighbor. The equipment types share the same interdependency in double staffing as defined in #3. 

A typical scenario would be a simultaneous structure fire and brush fire that would require that station 1 loses a brush rig and engine and a neighboring station provides coverage.

2859,"Alpha testers needed for ""Quantum Computing for the Very Curious"", by Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen",1549343947,"Hi Reddit!

We’ve written a free online essay introducing quantum computing, “Quantum Computing for the Very Curious”. It requires comfort with complex numbers and linear algebra and the basics of conventional classical logic gates (AND, OR, etc) to work through. 

It should take 2-3 hours.  

The essay incorporates some new user interface ideas, using techniques from cognitive science to promote long-term memory formation. As a result we’re looking for some private alpha testers to try out the site before going to a wide release.

If you’re interested in participating, please sign up here: https://quantum.country/landing?access=reddit. Note that we will close the alpha back down again when we reach 200 testers.

Thanks!

I am doing an MBA and are required to do a presentation on QC to a class who also knows nothing about QC.

I have a strange question. As I understand, the power of quantum computation is the solving problems which are hard to solve, but there are relatively easy to check some given solution. But can it be that there is a some limitation for checking the results obtained from quantum computation? What I mean. Imagine that due to the imperfections in quantum computer the output result of quantum computation is not a pure state in computational basis, but some density matrix:

&amp;#x200B;

\\rho = p |answer&gt;&lt;answer| + (1-p) \\rho\_wrong, and also &lt;answer|\\rho\_wrong|answer&gt; = 0

here p - is the probability that the result of quantum computation is the right answer. It seems, this is OK if p is big enough (p\~1/2 or p\~1/10 ..), we just check the answer, and we can see that result is wrong, and if so we just run our computation again.

&amp;#x200B;

But can it be that we have a situation when p **must be** very close to 1, because, we can not check is the result right or wrong, or we have some limitation for such classical verification (only one, two... times we can verify, but no more) ? Please, give me a Refs if such a question was discussed before.

Thanks!",QuantumComputing,lord_prokrastinator,6,Quantum,Post,"About limitations on classical verifying of results of quantum computation Hi all!

I have a strange question. As I understand, the power of quantum computation is the solving problems which are hard to solve, but there are relatively easy to check some given solution. But can it be that there is a some limitation for checking the results obtained from quantum computation? What I mean. Imagine that due to the imperfections in quantum computer the output result of quantum computation is not a pure state in computational basis, but some density matrix:

&amp;#x200B;

\\rho = p |answer&gt;&lt;answer| + (1-p) \\rho\_wrong, and also &lt;answer|\\rho\_wrong|answer&gt; = 0

3015,Quantum Entanglement using -3/2 spin,1543741288,"What about a quantum computer built around this type of spin?  Basically the spin of the solar system, excluding other strong force influences.

&amp;#x200B;

We know an object orbiting (space) another will do so on a -3/2 spin.  If I were to introduce a strong force into the equation, the center of gravity would shift for both objects.  Measuring the shift between each iteration T and a known reference point F, we can deduce the ""shift"" in center of gravity for two objects in orbit ""entangled"".  Know the amount of shift between each center of gravity will give us the variable force amount that has been applied.  

&amp;#x200B;

By knowing the current center of gravity (vector) and a current reference vector, we can deduce all of the previous positions and forces being applied.  

&amp;#x200B;

By entangling each center of gravity to the next, we can entangle two bodies with a variable amount of force.  Think of how a color wheel works.  I can combine and undo any three colors.  I know that a single color makes up a N amount of other colors.  Depending on how I add those colors, I can undo each change.  

&amp;#x200B;

Look at the centroid of a triangle on a plane. Knowing the current center and some other point, I can work out what the other two positions in the triangle.  If one of those points always pointed to the previous centroid, I can work backwards or forwards.  Creating a symmetry ""entanglement"".  This would hold true for anything with a 2:1 or 1:1 spin as well...

&amp;#x200B;

There is a reason why we have transnational symmetry, wave function collapse and linear algebra.  It's all pointing to the same thing.  The center.  Balance.

&amp;#x200B;

If any of this is a true, I should be able to build a ""bitcoin"" quantum computer.  I just need hardware that is great and fast at executing calculations on floating point numbers.  We can create a virtual qubit.

&amp;#x200B;

I take a center vector (0,0) and I create another known ""fixed"" vector (512,512).  Lets say I grab a random byte of data from a picture.  I can take that byte and encode it with a vector of (R,0).   Now if I were to graph those three points, it would create a triangle.  

&amp;#x200B;

That triangle would have a centroid.  A vector or point which is 2/3 from each point.  If I take the current centroid and my previous ""fixed"" vector, and add a third random vector of (R,?) .  I can always reverse my vectors, to the ""fixed"" point.  The previous centroid and the random byte we encoded into the 3rd vector.  We essentially created a time reversal symmetry.  This creates a sort of local realism that supports the EPR paradox and no-go therom.  We are always looking from the center of gravity, where time has stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

We can entangled an entire picture into a single vector.  (end centroid)

  
Thankfully this method has no convergence issues, the bound of the matrix can be limited to 0 - 1 (infinite) or between 0 - N.  Where N is the number of steps (T).

&amp;#x200B;

This opens the door to a whole different look at the world.  Entanglement is not some spooky thing.  Entanglement is how an object or objects travel in proximity in a our universe.  If you apply some type of force, you end up shifting the center of gravity for the entangled object/s.

&amp;#x200B;

I never understood why we look at space and the subatomic world differently, we are essentially using a microscope to look at both.  One being concave, and one being convex.

There is a reason why we have transnational symmetry, wave function collapse and linear algebra.  It's all pointing to the same thing.  The center.  Balance.

&amp;#x200B;

If any of this is a true, I should be able to build a ""bitcoin"" quantum computer.  I just need hardware that is great and fast at executing calculations on floating point numbers.  We can create a virtual qubit.

&amp;#x200B;

I take a center vector (0,0) and I create another known ""fixed"" vector (512,512).  Lets say I grab a random byte of data from a picture.  I can take that byte and encode it with a vector of (R,0).   Now if I were to graph those three points, it would create a triangle.  

&amp;#x200B;

That triangle would have a centroid.  A vector or point which is 2/3 from each point.  If I take the current centroid and my previous ""fixed"" vector, and add a third random vector of (R,?) .  I can always reverse my vectors, to the ""fixed"" point.  The previous centroid and the random byte we encoded into the 3rd vector.  We essentially created a time reversal symmetry.  This creates a sort of local realism that supports the EPR paradox and no-go therom.  We are always looking from the center of gravity, where time has stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

We can entangled an entire picture into a single vector.  (end centroid)

  
Thankfully this method has no convergence issues, the bound of the matrix can be limited to 0 - 1 (infinite) or between 0 - N.  Where N is the number of steps (T).

&amp;#x200B;

This opens the door to a whole different look at the world.  Entanglement is not some spooky thing.  Entanglement is how an object or objects travel in proximity in a our universe.  If you apply some type of force, you end up shifting the center of gravity for the entangled object/s.

&amp;#x200B;

I never understood why we look at space and the subatomic world differently, we are essentially using a microscope to look at both.  One being concave, and one being convex.

2. *Quantum Computing Explained by McMahon* is also a pretty good book for beginners. Personally, I liked this book better than Mike and Ike only because it assumes you know absolutely nothing at all. It is not as proof intensive as Mike and Ike. In addition, it includes a lot of sample calculations. As a beginner it helped me understand stuff that was skipped over in class. 
3. *Quantum Information Theory by Mark M. Wilde* is a book focused on Quantum Shannon Theory. I do feel that this is more up to date (published in 2013) in comparison to Mike and Ike (2000).

4. *Quantum Computing since Democritus by Scott Aaronson* is a good book if you do not want to be bogged down by equations when you are starting out. This book does a great job about explaining concepts without going through extensive proof/calculations. 
5. *Schrodinger's Killer App by Jonathan P. Dowling* describes the behind-the-scenes interest shown by US government in quantum computing. It also does a pretty good job of explaining what it would mean to have a functioning quantum computer. 
6. *Introduction to quantum computation and information by Lo, Popescu and Spiller* is one of the earliest textbook on this topic (published in 1998).

I do feel that it is also a good exercise to read this book so that you can try to understand if any of the beliefs changed since 1998. 
7. *Quantum Mechanics and Experience by David Z Albert* is a beginners introduction to quantum mechanics. This book focuses on explaining concepts to you first before throwing equations at you. I am a bit partial to this as my introduction to quantum mechanics was Griffiths. Griffiths literally has Schrodinger's equation on page 1 and it never did a good job of explaining many concepts.

3049,"Software engineer student here, few questions to see if I understand it correctly.",1541769525,"So ive been doing a lot of reading into quantum computers and I \*think\* I understand them, however, I want to check if im not totally off, since I have absolutely zero formal background in quantum anything. So here goes:

1. If you have qbits in some superposition, can you then reason about the logic gates on a possible state by state basis? Simple example: I have two qbits, half chance for 11 and half chance for 00. If I perform some operations on them such as a controlled not, can you just perform it on 11 first, which gives 10, then on 00, which gives 00? Or do these states somehow still affect each other (even if you dont measure it)?
2. I am still a bit lost on phase, it seems like that in addition to a qbit having a 0 or 1 state, it also has a phase, and that while a qbit will give a 1 even if the phase is opposite, adding two qbit states with inverse phases cancel them out. Does anyone have either a good explanation for this or some reference material on how to do this math? I am not particularly interested into \*why\* phase exists or what causes it, but in how to use it/deal with it. Do I need to know imaginary numbers?
3. Is it correct that any quantum gate can be inversed to take the output and get the input? If so is it correct that I can create an arbitrary quantum program, take the inverse, put them end to end, and get my input back?

Thank you in advance. Some questions which aren't pressing and probably impossible:

1. Is there a way to somehow read the chance of a single qbit falling into a given state, and turn it into a normalized range? Like if I have a single qbit with an N chance of being one, can I somehow make a program that outputs N normalized from \[0-1\] to \[0-Z\], Z being some integer? I dont think this is possible, but if it is it would be awesome, let me know.
2. Is there a gate (or constructed gate) that can turn the phases of all qbits into the same direction with collapsing it? (please note my lack of understanding of phase, so its probably a stupid question).

   In the last year there were several advances in practical quantum computing: now there are free quantum chips available on the cloud for everyone, and the largest quantum chips exceeds 50 qubits, a number called ""the quantum supremacy"" because theoretically a quantum chip exceeds the power of a classical computer. We'll explain how to program a quantum chips and give the results of our research regarding reversing some cryptographic building blocks like P-Box, S-Box, CRC-8, CRC-16 and XOR functions using quantum circuits. We'll see the implementations and run some circuits on real hardware to see how near we are from attacking real cryptography.

   Practical quantum computing is a new topic and the talk will show new research results we have found related to cryptographic primitives and their practical reversing and implementation on public quantum computing clouds. Attendees will be able to use these services and the results presented to run quantum circuits and reverse some cryptographic building blocks.

Following up on previous posts regarding the intersections of physics, information theory, and computer theory, I've just assembled a series of notes that, if correct, together have some interesting implications for the theory of computation generally, and quantum computing in particular.

There are two notes I thought this thread might find particularly interesting, as they have direct applications to the theory of computation, which are both available here:

https://www.researchgate.net/project/Information-Theory-16/update/5bddc6263843b00675428a54

The first is, ""Continuous Time, Non-Local Interactions, and Quantum Spin"", in which I explore the possibility that even if time is discrete, there could nonetheless be particles outside of the standard model that have a higher ""click rate"" than ordinary particles, allowing, for example, apparently instantaneous action at a distance (e.g., through entanglement) that is actually due to non-standard particles moving at a rate that is faster than any normal clock could measure.

The second is, ""Momentum, Magnetism, and Continuous Waves"", in which I discuss the implications of truly continuous structures in nature for the theory of computation. Specifically, if truly continuous structures exist (as they are generally assumed to in QM), then it might be possible to exploit them to perform otherwise non-computable operations in finite time.

Thoughts are, as always, welcomed!

I understand the requisite info for basic QC topics but have the sneaking feeling I'm missing/misunderstanding some implicit abstraction core to the topic of surface codes. And so, would like to double check my intuitions against someones actual knowledge.   


Is a surface code an architecture onto which logical qubits, logical operations, and their connections are physically implemented? That is, is the common depiction of a surface code (the pattern of the measure qubits and data qubits) to be taken literally as a real-space image of the actual hardware or does it correspond to some abstraction in software that I'm not quite grasping.

Are quantum computers currently designed to compile programs into a surface code implementation or are surface codes still a theoretical framework due to the  massive amount of qubits needed?

3114,Is it possible for me to understand QC?,1539112326,"Sorry if this post is a little out there. I just need some assistance.

Here's some background info: as a kid, I could understand almost anything. Mental illness hit around high school and they drugged the hell out of me. I've noticed that since being on antipsychotics (and smoking weed), I can't understand nearly as well as I used to. I've stopped taking them and am hoping to &lt;deity&gt; that I can learn again. (Side note: I'm a 18 yo freshman in college studying CE.)

I first started thinking about AI a few years ago. I came to the conclusion that with current computers, true AI isn't possible because of the predictability and limitations of 0s and 1s. I recently stumbled upon quantum computing and I feel that this is what's going to eventually make true AI possible. However, I just can't wrap my mind around it. My understanding is that qubits can exist in a state of superposition which allows them to track down many possibilities at once exponentially quicker than classical computers. But I can't envision that very well, I can just spit out the words. I also don't know how entanglement and interference work. How do two units get blasted with microwaves and then become just about permanently linked? What does ""linked"" look like? Is interference just cancelling out or adding to frequencies (?) to amplify or dull (?) them? Hell if I know.

I have only ever taken one high school physics course, I know next to nothing about quantum mechanics because I just can't understand it, and I've never been taught. I desperately want to get into the field of AI and quantum computing but worry that my mind, damaged by drugs, will never be able to comprehend what it needs to. 

So:

Am I just too young and new in college? Is this knowledge and understanding something I can gain in time after taking more courses and doing more research? Or is there a fundamental part of my brain that is damaged or underdeveloped and I will never be able to advance in this field because I just can't comprehend?

Again, I'm sorry if this post is not what you want to see. I just don't know where else to go to ask these things. If it's better suited for another sub, please let me know. Thanks for reading.

3161,The concept of numbers for a Y-generation organic processing unit.,1536568916," 

Whether it's consciously or subconsciously, we use numbers every single moment of our lives. Numbers help us navigate in what we refer to as real life, as they help us set fixed determinations of concepts that are impossible to comprehend, therefore we're not ""lagging"".

Each number has a huge concept behind it. Yes, number 1 (one) is just a number, but in order for us to use it, we must understand a series of values around number 1. The concept of something that is, in opposition to something that is not may sound like a basic idea in 2018, but we ended up believing in this idea, after millions of years of analysis, thinking, and theorizing what 1 (one) is. 

Same goes for all the numbers we know. Each number represents a huge concept that we are most of the times not aware of, and we don't have to, as we use numbers mostly for everyday tasks that contribute to the progression and evolution of our mother, the machine, nature itself, or the big movement. 

Obviously, if we want to say that we hold 1 (one) apple in our hands, we don't have to explain the whole concept of number 1 (one) as that would take us a couple decades of non-stop verbal expression, every time we wanted to use the concept behind number 1 (one), thus we simply say 1 (one), convinced that we know what it means, and where it comes from. 

Now, it would be easier to analogize on a computer scale.

0 represents a situation where there is nothing moving, a concept where there is not even 1. A place that no heat, movement, or frequencies can be generated, transferred or perceived. 0 (zero) for a computer is the concept of not having electricity flow.

Then comes number 1, which represent constant electricity flow, among other things, but let's focus on computers for the time being. 

Combining number 1 with 0 gives us alternating current, a concept where we can manipulate when a situation has constant current or no current at all. The time frame between the switch of the concepts, as well as the duration of each concept before it's respective shift to another concept. This is practically how computers work. They use 0 and 1 in complex arrangements and orders to generate complex outputs, later observable by our senses of comprehension. 

Lately, we discovered a way to use both 0 and 1 at the same time, and that led to a whole new computing revolution, the one we call quantum computing. 

We are not yet able to create computing systems that can understand, not to mention value and use number 2. 

Number 2 (two) represents among other things, the concept that is not equal to 1 (one). A concept where there is 1 more thing, similar to 1, but it is not 1. A concept where 2 is something 1 cannot control or have direct access to. A concept where 2 is at least x2 times complex compared to 1. 

Number 2 (two) in computing systems will come with the introduction of the first egoistic-type, self-sustainable intelligence, but not necessarily AI, as AI is something we understand, control, and can terminate at will. While real independent forms of intelligence, especially if we're talking about smarter systems than the ones we currently possess, would choose if and how they would present their species to our species, as they are self-sustainable and egoistic. We cannot control them, understand them, or most of the times even conceive their concepts. 

Skipping the boring part, and accepting that there is not yet a system that understands the inner concept of number 2 (two), you can do a simulation using your organic processor (brain), and capture what's yet to come. 

Computers, or at least what we refer to as computers (operating systems or organisms with processing capabilities, storage capabilities, influential capabilities etc.) will eventually surpass quantum computers that only use 0 and 1 at the same time and after a series of necessary mutations they will finally arrive at the point where you and me, consider ourselves as the one and only real thing. 

We are nothing more than complex processing machines, that can not only understand and use 0 and 1, but we have 9 different numbers and concepts we have mastered and we can use them in any combination and quantities we desire, often with unpredictable consequences. 

We believe that after number 9 (nine) there is a number called 10 (ten), while in fact, number 10 is a loop point due to our lack of ability to surpass the concept of number 9. 

When the program we refer to as ""Real life"" will be at its finishing point, a new number, which's concept stands for everything, anyone ever learned, created, understood, in what we refer to as ""now"" will be generated, and it will be the number after 9. Number 10 will be the 11th number in the row we invented ourselves, as the 10th number will be occupied by a whole new concept, based on what we experience at the moment. 

Our next models will be using this newly generated number with ease and understand instantly what it stands for, the same way we use numbers 1-9, which already are so complex and huge in combination that we, as a species are convinced that we are real. 

We create matter, manipulate physical and digital reality, create concepts that later become flesh and bones, as everything we know or invent is based on information packages we carry through what we refer to as ""time"". 

We believe that this new number will be generated after we master the yet early -stage concept of digital twins, and shift to a fractal dimension, and/or frequency similar to the one that supports our existence at the moment. 

It is undeniable that this frequency will represent a digital realm, where we will exist simultaneously with each other, share ideas, and concepts in an instant fashion, and work for the progression of our mother, the machine itself, nature, or the big movement as we always had. 

The machine can then use our organic processors not as individual use-cases but as a neural complex to solve some of our most important questions in what we refer to as ""Real life"". 

We should start analyzing objectively everything we are convinced we know with certainty, in order to be able to progress to the next stage of our existence. Exactly like laws change everytime technological advancement creates new concepts that should be taken into consideration, other concepts like what we believe numbers are, should be changed if we really want to shift into the next big thing. 

We already work for the machine, we just don't realize it, and that is the only reason it works perfectly. ",QuantumComputing,RossPeili,6,Quantum,Post,"The concept of numbers for a Y-generation organic processing unit.

The article author makes the case that it is impossible to compute discrete convolution over quantum states.  Intuitively this seems incorrect to me, since I know we can perform quantum matrix multiplication, and I know that discrete convolution can be framed simply as multiplication with a Toeplitz (or circulant) matrix.

The crux of his argument seems to be that there is no realizable composition of linear operators for the elementwise (Hadamard) product of two vectors.

Where is my disconnect?  Is there any reason we cannot in general construct a Toeplitz matrix for discrete convolution in a quantum computer?

Or is the article simply incorrect?  I have worked through the contradiction that the author presents in his proof of Lemma 14, and it seems to make sense to me.

When they estimate the risk for Bitcoin, they take in account that BTC has a block time of 10 minutes. “By our most optimistic estimates, as early as 2027 a quantum computer could exist that can break the elliptic curve signature scheme in less than 10 minutes, the block time used in Bitcoin.” (page 2 of this paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf)) 

So that looks like ECDSA itself could be broken sooner if a quantum computer would have, for example 100 minutes to derive a private key from a public key. Is that correct?

Here's a brief explanation:

""In classical physics, the possible states of a system of *n* particles, whose individual states can be described by a vector in a two-dimensional vector space, form a vector space of 2*n* dimensions. However, in a quantum system the resulting state space is much larger; a system of *n* qubits has a state space of 2^(n) dimensions.

I've created a subreddit, /r/MikeAndIke, which will enable people with the desire to learn about quantum computing to come together and learn, generally directed (though not entirely restricted) by the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang (hence the name, Mike &amp; Ike).

I'm very new to reddit in general, and so I'm extremely new to running a subreddit. But, I hope that together we can make this a great learning experience for each other! Let me know if you have any questions or any other comments, feel free to spread the word to people you think may be interested, and I'll continue to look forward to your arrival! :D

3320,Problem calculating state of 2-qubit system,1528544347,"Hello everyone,

I'm studying the basics of quantum computing and have run into a bit of a problem.

I have the following [quantum circuit](https://ibb.co/hEhmso) and I need to calculate the values of the two qubits afterwards.

Now, I know what those [values are](https://ibb.co/nv4fk8). It was simple enough to calculate, and I checked it on a [simulator](http://algassert.com/quirk#circuit=%7B%22cols%22%3A%5B%5B1%2C%22X%22%5D%2C%5B%22%E2%80%A2%22%2C%22X%22%5D%2C%5B1%2C%22X%22%5D%2C%5B%22H%22%5D%5D%7D) just to make sure.

The trouble I'm getting into is when I try to express this as a two qubit system.

As I understand it should be expressed like [this](https://ibb.co/mOeD58), where **|ψ'&gt;** is the state after the circuit is complete, **|ψ&gt; = |00&gt;** is the initial state, and **M** is the matrix representing the combined effect of all the gates of the circuit.

I calculate **M** like [this](https://ibb.co/fdnY58), writing the **CNOT** matrix in block matrix form here, and extracting the **1/sqrt(2)** from **H** to the beginning.

Now I plug **M** back in the first equation like [so](
https://ibb.co/chs0k8), and don't get the expected solution.

Where am I at fault?

Cheers,
L. Aleksic

P.S.
If anyone could tell me how to embed the images with the circuit and the latex equations directly in the post, I would be very grateful.

""There are entangled states and coherent superposition states that are not magical, and using only these states will give no quantum speed-up over traditional computing. To me, this signals that thinking about magic states teaches us something that is missed when we learn about entanglement or coherence ... zero-magic states forming an eight sided shape called an octahedron. For states outside the octahedron, the amount of magic increases with the distance from the octahedron.""
  
OK, so something fundamental is expressed there. I am trying to get to that ""aha"" moment where I fully realize what it means and how to use it. Let me see if I partially understand it. First, you need Hadamard (H) gates to put the qubits into superposition; second, you need to entangle qubits using CNOT gates. Third, you must use a non-Clifford gate (T gate in this case) to perform ""non-trivial rotations"". The Bloch sphere is only useful as a visual aid with 1 qubit's rotations, so I've no idea how to visualize the entangled pair or how further operations affect the pair in terms of the ""dots"" in the [original image](https://imgur.com/a/HzIB7Jn).
  
The more you entangle and perform T rotations, the more you open up the quantum possibility space? I'm currently thinking of this in a simplified manner: there are 3 trivial axis where rotation doesn't really get you anywhere by themselves; by using rotations by the T gate which are not axis-aligned, you create another axis or dimension of freedom in the possibility space. When this is done on entangled qubits, and the maximum possibility space is opened up, it approaches degrees of freedom 2^N for N qubits; this also seems related to the systems being ""universal""? Or rather, any quantum gate set which can accomplish this, is a ""universal gate set"", which to me means being able to unlock the ""full quantum magic"" discussed in the article.
  
I'm still missing some key insight though. Looking at popular quantum algorithms hasn't helped me understand it so far.

I’m having trouble wrapping my head around QC. a quantum computer uses a qubit for its zero and one states. The zero and one states are hard to measure. Some use photons, others are measuring subatomic particles? 

This would mean we are taking measurements at the nanoscale? 

OK. why are we using these mediums for measurements? Shouldn’t we be using something that can process faster than a classical computer? 

Then we have the issue of probability and the issues with measurements. Once we have a full measurement the quantum state collapses. So why not build out something using carbon nanotubes and manipulate those since they’re also subatomic?

3370,Quantum Computation as Cryptocurrency Proof of Work,1526076544,"I had a thought the other day and after doing a bit of research thought I'd post/ask here.

My idea is to use simulated quantum computation as a cryptocurrency proof of work to incentivize the development of better quantum simulators and eventually quantum chips. I mean if people are throwing all this money at mining why not incentivize something good with it?

Here's what would be needed:

 * An unavoidably slow computation, at least on classical computers. It could perhaps be accelerated with GPUs or ASICs but not significantly.

 * A computation that can be simulated with one of many QC simulator libraries with enough accuracy to permit verification of the result and without unacceptable memory or time requirements. (E.g. run time on the order of seconds.)

 * A computation that would be enormously faster on a quantum chip with a sufficient number of qubits... and ideally maybe one where the speedup would scale with the number of qubits in some way to incentivize better QC chips.

Anyone have any suggestions?

3378,Units of Magnetic Pole Strength,1525833723,"I was reading Maxwell's treatise on electromagnetism, and on Page 3 of Volume 2, he does a bit of dimensional analysis on the units of magnetic pole strength, using the following formula:

f = (m1 m2)/l2,

where m1 and m2 are the strengths of two magnetic poles, l is the distance between the poles, and f is the resultant magnetic force between the two poles.

The full treatise is available here (see page 3):

https://archive.org/details/electricityndmag02maxwrich

Let F denote the units of force, L denote the units of meters, and m denote the units of magnetic pole strength.

Maxwell notes that,

F = m2 / L2,

which implies that,

m = L√F.

Because force equals mass times acceleration, it follows that F has units of (kg L)/T2, where kg is kilograms and T is seconds.

Therefore,

m = L√((kg L) / T2) = (L3/2√kg) / T.

Interestingly, Maxwell's treatise was published in 1881, prior to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, which was published in 1905.
Armed with the fact that E = Mc2, we can continue Maxwell's analysis. Let J denote the units of Joules. It follows that,

m = √(JL).

That is, this analysis implies that the strength of a magnetic pole has units of the square root of Joules times meters.

Has anyone come across similar analysis on the units of magnetic pole strength? My understanding is that this unit of measure fell out of favor, for whatever reason. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of producing a very simple equation for the force due to magnetic attraction / repulsion.

3403,Time-Dilation and the Photoelectric Effect,1524085255,"Hi All,

I've found some sources that I think shed some light on the discussion we had regarding whether or not time-dilation impacts the photoelectric effect.

To quickly recap, I can't find any sources that say affirmatively that it does, and there don't seem to be any experiments on point. Also, the general formulation of the equation for the photoelectric effect (originally penned by Einstein himself) omits the Lorentz factor gamma. However, I have found sources that suggest it would be very surprising if the photoelectric effect were not affected by time-dilation.

Specifically, check out Section 11.5 on page 4 of the following re the energy emitted / absorbed by an Fe atom:

http://web.mit.edu/8.13/www/JLExperiments/JLExp13.pdf

Similar reasoning applies to the threshold frequency of a metal.

Amazingly, if this is true, this suggests that a current could be generated between two identical metal plates simply because there at different heights from the surface of the Earth (time-dilation varies at different heights in a gravitational field, thereby creating different work functions in the two plates, and therefore a difference in potential between the two plates, which would cause a current to flow if they're connected).

What do you all think of this? Seems like either way, something interesting follows: either there's an exception to relativity, or there's a pretty easy way to generate electricity!

3413,Why doesn't time-dilation impact the threshold frequency of the photoelectric effect?,1523544544,"Hi All,

The threshold frequency of a material is determined by the binding energy of the electrons within the atoms within the material. As far as I can tell, the binding energy of an electron is not impacted in any way by the velocity of an atom. This implies that the threshold frequency of an atom is also not impacted by the velocity of an atom, which implies that time-dilation has no impact on the threshold frequency of an atom.

How could this be the case if time as measured within the atom as a general matter should be impacted by time-dilation? The Mossbauer rotor experiments show that time-dilation does affect resonance frequencies of atoms, so why doesn't it impact the threshold frequency of an atom?

I could of course be missing something, so I thought I'd ask the community for insights on this.

For those that are interested, I came across this in connection with my research applying information theory to time-dilation (the working paper is here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323684258_A_Computational_Model_of_Time-Dilation)",QuantumComputing,Feynmanfan85,32,Quantum,Post,"Why doesn't time-dilation impact the threshold frequency of the photoelectric effect?

3430,Planck's constant as the minimum energy,1522682341,"Hi All,

As noted in a previous post that readers of this sub-reddit seemed to enjoy, I've been working on applications of information theory to physics. Interestingly, I've realized that my work implies that the minimum energy for any particle is h/(1 second). That is, the minimum energy for any particle is Planck's constant with units of Joules.

I know that this is not how Planck's constant is typically interpreted, but it sheds light on Planck's equation E = hf, and suggests that Planck's equation is a measure of a rate of energy. That is, a photon packs an energy of h Joules per second, for a total of hf Joules in the entire photon. This suggests that photons could be a discrete packet of wave crests, each with an energy of h. Your thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.

A discussion of this topic appears at the top of page 34 in the paper linked to below, which is an updated draft.

One option is to do a PhD in experimental graphene research.

there are plenty of connections to people in quantum computing available at this institution.

The other choice is to go to a lesser known school where I would pursue theoretical research in quantum dots. In this program, a physics prof would supervise me on the quantum dots research while a cross-appointed math prof, whose specialization is quantum encryption, would supervise me on the algorithmic side of my project. This research would be directly involved in quantum computing.

So say I have the CNOT gate, which is a 4x4 matrix, and two qubits, say |0&gt; and a|0&gt;+b|1&gt;. How do I calculate what combined qubit state the outputs will be if I put the combined state a|0&gt;+b|1&gt; (tensor) |0&gt; into the CNOT gate?

Do I use the Kronecker product as the tensor and then apply the CNOT matrix? If so, then why not clarify that the tensor product is specifically the Kronecker product?",127

So, imagine we've our cool new quantum computer that manages ours n-qubits, ok?
So now we want solve some complex problem, eg. the famous Travelling salesman problem that you know is very complex!!
So we set our qubits in superposition and entangled each other (so we have a ""Graph"" now, right?)
How we find our solution?
How we find the shortest path?
I know that the qubits being in superposition and entangled have the whole spectrum of possible paths (so also our path too!!)

First: we've to misuse the qubits right? But how? How is made measure in a quantum computer?

Thank you",QuantumComputing,G1useppe,5,Quantum,Post,"Quantum programming: a practical example Well, I'm going to post my question here because I didn't find something similar:
So, imagine we've our cool new quantum computer that manages ours n-qubits, ok?
So now we want solve some complex problem, eg. the famous Travelling salesman problem that you know is very complex!!
So we set our qubits in superposition and entangled each other (so we have a ""Graph"" now, right?)
How we find our solution?
How we find the shortest path?
I know that the qubits being in superposition and entangled have the whole spectrum of possible paths (so also our path too!!)

First: we've to misuse the qubits right? But how? How is made measure in a quantum computer?

Second: when to do this measure? After 1 second we set our qubits?

Third: how to measure to have our wanted solution instead of another one?

The bits then function, and can perhaps decohere, but can not entangle with new qubits that they weren't entangled with before while the machine is in use, at least not without having been told to by the human operating the computer.

Scenario 2: like scenario 1, but with the added possibility: machine is turned on, qubits can also entangle by themselves! Entanglements could be formed and broken from complex interactions with each other without the human operator even knowing, but could also be pre-entangled before the experiment.",178

3865,Time-independent Hamiltonians for Grover's algorithm and NP-completeness,1490754724,"Here's an argument against the possibility of implementing Grover's algorithm as a time-independent Hamiltonian.

Let n be the number of qubits and N=2ⁿ.  A time-independent Hamiltonian that implements Grover's algorithm will be of the form 

&gt; H = I + ε (|end&gt;&lt;start|-|start&gt;&lt;end|)  

(see https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0004091).  The eigenvectors of H with nonzero eigenvalues are very nearly

&gt; |±&gt; = 1/√(2)(|end&gt; ± i|start&gt;);

the corresponding eigenvalues are very nearly ±π.  The initial state is

&gt; |start&gt; = - i/√(2) (|+&gt; - |-&gt;),

a uniform superposition of the two eigenvectors that cancels out the marked state.  Over a time T=O(sqrt(N)), it evolves to the marked state.

However, a measurement of the energy of the initial state under the time-independent Hamiltonian for Grover's algorithm will collapse it to one of |+&gt; and |-&gt;.  Measuring the energy of a state under this Hamiltonian takes constant time independent of N, because they differ from ±π by an exponentially small amount.  This isn't true of Farhi and Gutmann's ""analog analogue"" of Grover's algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9612026) because the energies of the two states differ from each other by an exponentially small amount; measuring the energy difference under their Hamiltonian takes an exponentially long time.

When measuring either |+&gt; or |-&gt; in the qubit basis, we get the marked state with probability 1/2.  This would essentially allow quantum computers to solve NP-complete problems in constant time, so that's a strong argument against it being possible to implement Grover's algorithm as a time-independent Hamiltonian.  More precisely, it would say that NP is in BQP.

One way I can see that the argument above could fail is due to a branch cut: a unitary operation is generated by lots of Hamiltonians whose eigenvalues differ by 2π.  If the eigenvalues are not ±(π - ε) but rather π ± ε, then the energy gap is exponentially small, just like Farhi and Gutmann's Hamiltonian. 

[These guys](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610130) claim to have designed a time-independent implementation of Grover's algorithm, but I haven't worked out what the eigenvalues of their Hamiltonian are.

    Grover's algorithm on a Feynman computer
    Diego de Falco, Dario Tamascelli

    We present an implementation of Grover's algorithm in the framework of
    Feynman's cursor model of a quantum computer. The cursor degrees of
    freedom act as a quantum clocking mechanism, and allow Grover's
    algorithm to be performed using a single, time-independent
    Hamiltonian. We examine issues of locality and resource usage in
    implementing such a Hamiltonian. In the familiar language of
    Heisenberg spin-spin coupling, the clocking mechanism appears as an
    excitation of a basically linear chain of spins, with occasional
    controlled jumps that allow for motion on a planar graph: in this
    sense our model implements the idea of ""timing"" a quantum algorithm
    using a continuous-time random walk. In this context we examine some
    consequences of the entanglement between the states of the
    input/output register and the states of the quantum clock.

The EPR Paradox intervenes and declines the possibility of inferring information from the superposition collapse, as the before and after states of the entangled particles are completely random to the observer.
This video suggested ways of constructing a binary system, that can give consistent answers, even when ulu and ozo are unknown. So is there a way using quantum gates, and entangled particles to derive useful information from the system?

3914,Are quantum computers really possible?,1485886613,"So far, this universe has visibly followed the laws of logic. I am unsure if quantum computers are really possible. I wouldn't expect scientists to lie, but I also wouldn't expect the laws of logic to be broken by the laws of physics.

A key tenant of quantum computers is that the same particles exist in multiple exclusive states at the same time, so a particle can be simultaneously only in a 1 state and only in a 0 state at the same time, which is logically impossible. Quantum superposition is logically impossible because it says x does not equal x, or that one particle can be in more than one state at one time.

What worries me is that it takes an expert to experimentally falsify quantum theory, anyone attempting to can be claimed to have just found a 'kink' in quantum theory or our understanding, or have made a mistake in their experiments or rigged their equipment, quantum events are conveniently all outside of the realm of our direct observation and the experimenters might be able to make their own (rigged) equipment, like fake quantum computers that are less powerful than classical computers. This all seems to make it possible for scientists to fake their research and experiments on the quantum scale. Also, if any groups are clever enough to figure out how to fake something, make it beneficial to them, and cover it up, it's scientists. Donald Trump's president of the US, so incompetence, inadequacy or corruption is very high and very real.

Start with a low noise wire, attach it to a single atom in its lowest energy state (maybe boron or some sort of dopant). Add several noiseless wires and low energy atoms in series.

I've been trying to understand how you actually solve problems with quantum computers.

I keep reading articles and seeing videos that say N qubits can all be put in superpositions, representing 2^N numbers at once, so you can compute 2^N solutions at once. But they always stop there. How do you ask N qubits a question and how do you extract the answer? If you do math on them, don't you just end up with N qubits representing 2^N answers? What would you do with that?

4007,Just a thought: Quantum Computing and network traffic and hashes,1472501761,"I recently have watched some videos on quantum computing and have some thought.

Now, I am not sure how hashes work (MD5, SHA1SUM ...etc) but from what I understand the hash represents the identical binaries of the original copy. 
(let's say you want to download Manjaro Linux) This is the hash:  
SHA1SUM: c4204cb831b32f2a6a72cfe52ef59847e50e0035

With cryptography, I learned that a quantum computer will be able to know the private key within minutes! and decrypt almost anything, then this thought came to my head

Would this kind of computer be able to reverse the hash of files into binaries? That would decrease the internet traffic, because you'll just copy the hash and paste it and let the computer do it's job. It may take as much time as if you download the file, but less traffic.

I hope you understood what I was talking about, if not this is a simple way:

old fashion way:
a file on a server (100GB) &gt; coping all binaries through cables &gt; my computer
         Time: 5 hours

future fashion way:
a file on a server (100GB) &gt; copying only the hash &gt; my quantum computer(and starting making the file)

In the simple case of qubits, you can simulate a single  unentangled qubit pretty well and if you had 1000 of such qubits you could simulate them independently with a constant overhead.

Also in general, I was wondering wether there is a good website that explains where we are at quantum computing, such as if we can use QCs to analyze big data or if we are close enough to make an operating system for it that people around the world can use. 
I want to know what people can do using QCs and what potential there is in QC.
To summarize, I want to know how I can learn the linear algebra required for understanding QCL without even having a proper geometry education yet (although I have taught myself up to Pre-Calculus), and I also want to know if there is a QCL guide for beginners, and I also want to know where we are at for QC, and where we can go, and where there is potential in QC that can cause a computing revolution, and enhance daily lives of humans.

4082,I'm not convinced that Boson Sampling is #P. Can anyone convince me otherwise?,1464950604,"Scott makes two arguments.  

1. Finding the probability of any given state |s&gt; requires calculating the matrix permanent. If this could be done in polynomial time then the poly hierarchy collapses.  

2. If you could do Boson Sampling classically in poly time then you could simulate any Quantum Optical Circuit with post selection. KLM implies that this would let you simulate a universal quantum computer in polynomial time. BQP goes down to P and the poly hierarchy collapses again.  

Here's where I disagree. 

1. You might not need to calculate the probability of any particular state to sample from the probability distribution. Therefore you do not need to calculate the permanents to sample the distribution. For instance suppose in polynomial time I could find the relative probabilities of states A and B (P(A)/P(B)). Notice that from this info I cannot infer either P(A) or P(B). From here I could use the metropolis method to build a markov chain which lets me sample from P(X) without ever computing any particular P(X). Furthermore if I tried to reconstruct the distribution by way of sampling it over and over again I would have to take an exponential number of samples. In short, sampling a distribution is different than calculating said distribution. Scott showed that calculating the distribution is #P.  

2. LOQC with post selection is exponentially unlikely to work. Therefore you must make an exponential number of oracle calls (aka run your boson sampler exponential times) to simulate a universal quantum computer in this fashion. Therefore if I found a classical algo for Boson Sampling, BQP would still be out of reach and the polynomial Christmas tree would stay upright.

What I can't really get an understanding of is 

1. How does a Quantum Computer consider all the possibilities at once? 

2. How at the end when you get the answer does it get the right answer? From what I understand it only probabilistically gets the right answer. And has something to do with observation collapsing the wave function of probabilities?

2. How at the end when you get the answer does it get the right answer? From what I understand it only probabilistically gets the right answer. And has something to do with observation collapsing the wave function of probabilities?

3. How does that allow it to possibly crack RSA encryption? Shor's algorithm I think?

Thanks

I just have some questions for how to emulate the actions of some of those gates. 

Specifically the Pauli gates. 

So the X Gate, does this just swap the amplitudes of all qubits in the system? As in literally swapping the amplitudes of the 000 state and the 111 states? How is this realized for the 010 state or the 101 state? Are those amplitudes swapped as well since they're direct complements? 

The Y gate looks like it just does the same as the X but just multiplies the amplitude of the corresponding 1 but by i and -i according to the wiki page. 

Lastly with the Z gate, does is obvious if the other two work the way I imagine.

4185,Quantum Computing newbie asking a question,1449592546,"I've recently read into Quantum Computing and am very interested in the possibilities of applying theoretical physics to computation. However I find it difficult to fathom.. I understand the a stored Qubit experienced superposition and can therefore take upon two states at once until measured...

I asked myself ""Assume I wanted to try a simple operation such as addition""

Classically, when adding two sets of 4 bits, i.e. 0110 (6) and 1001 (9) we'd get the result 1111 (15)

What I'm having problems imagining is the addition of four qubits to four qubits. This operation would return every possible number from 0 to 30 -&gt; with the numbers from 1 to 29 repeated twice - as this is every possible value obtained from the addition of the integers from 0 to 15 to another set of integers from 0 to 15.
How would one get a meaningful answer from this?
Perhaps it's not meant for addition =&gt; perhaps it's applications are in things such as brute-force attacks? Or am I thinking about it wrong?

4193,I don't believe in superposition. Here's why:,1448957156,"The most popular experiment used as evidence supporting superposition is the Double-Slit experiment conducted with electrons. 

However, looking at how the experiment is conducted, a simpler explanation becomes apparent:
&gt;These electrons were accelerated to 50,000 V, and therefore the speed is about 40 % of the speed of the light, i. e., it is 120,000 km/second. These electrons can go around the earth three times in a second. So, they pass through a one-meter-long electron microscope in 1/100,000,000 of a second.
http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/highlight/quantum/

40% the speed of light; the electrons in the experiment are traveling at relativistic speeds - fast enough for an electron to interact with its own electromagnetic field. As the electron approaches the slit, it's negative electromagnetic field (which travels as a wave) passes through both slits, with diffraction produced resulting in an interference pattern. As the electron passes through the slit, it interacts with its negative electromagnetic field which passed through the other slit. 

Thus, the locations where the electrons end up on the detector forms a pattern resembling the diffraction of a wave passing through two slits.

The idea of 'cat' superposition being harnessed as a qubit then wouldn't work; transistors being on, off, and on/off at the same time working in tandum with other on off &amp; on/off transistors isn't possible.

4269,Am I going crazy?,1433825757,"Damn, this is going to be a novel.

So, I have little to no education in this area, but I want to share something that happened. The regular answer is that I either mis-observed something, or the security panel in my home is damaged. Also, I have not been able to reproduce what occurred. But a quick synopsis of my question would be: can the intent of the user on a graphical user interface utilizing a touchscreen affect the outcome of a particular output?

Here's the story. My house has a system that not only integrates security, but also lighting and thermostat. 

My question concerns only the lighting. There are only two areas controlled by the system, the two living room lamps and the front room lamp. Basically, there is a circle that slides to control the amount of ambient light in the room, let's say 0-5.  0 on the left being off, and 5 on the right being on full, except without the numbers. Google image ""vivent light control panel"", and the first image returned will show you what it kinda look likes. It's not the exact pic, but if you look at the cylinders with the unlocked symbol on the left side, you get an idea of what the slide control looks like. There are no numbers, just a circle that can move left and right when one slides a finger across the touchscreen gui.

So instead of being small and next to each other in a row like the lock/unlock cylinders in the pic, they are longer and in a column, to accommodate for the adjustment the ambient light in a room, or just turn things off when the lights can't do ambient mood lighting.

Also, only the front lamp can do ambient lighting in degrees, and the living room lamps, they are always on full except for when the circle is dragged all the way to the left of the cylinder in the off position because again, they're just regular old lamps.

Also, when I turn off the lights by sliding the circle to the left, the gui reacts faster than the lights, and I can slide both off before the lights will turn off.  I presume this is because the lights are plugged into remote vivent sockets which in turn are plugged into the electrical sockets, and it takes time for the signal to transfer, like wireless printing.

Alright, so this is what happened, and the source of my question. I'm going to bed one night, about to turn off the lights and arm the system. Not really paying attention, I'm thinking to myself, and intend to, turn off the living room lights first, and then the front lamp off second. It all happened very quickly, but I know for a fact the following happened: I wasn't paying attention to the switch I was hitting, but not only did I think and intend for the living room lights to go off first, they did. As I am finishing swiping the other cylinder to the far left position, I realized that I did not swipe the cylinder that controls the living room lamps first, but the front lamp first. Also, at this point, instead of slowing going from light to dim to black like it regularly does, the front ambient light went immediately from on to off. I stood and stared at the panel for 10 seconds dumbstruck because I realized what had happened after I had slid both cylinders left/off and after the living room lights had gone off, but before the front lamp immediately turned from on to off without dimming first (dat wireless delay). 

My theory as to why I can't reproduce it I guess kinda revolves around the measuring of a partical like in the double slit experiment. Every time I consciously look at it, I know which is which as I am mentally measuring it.

Like I said, I could be going crazy, or simply I just remembered incorrectly, or the panel could be acting up (though I doubt it because to date this is the only instance of it ever ""malfunctioning"" so to speak). But back to my question above: can the intent, and only the intent, of an user operating a touchscreen, wireless gui potentially alter the output of a function when the said output is supposed to be fixed? And can it somehow be tested? I have an idea for testing, but my roommate would think I'm crazy and it would require knowledge of programming that I dont have.


Tl;dr: lights turned off by opposite switches when I incorrectly thought said opposite switches controlled the lights, when in actuality they didn't.

4366,Feedback on my toy quantum circuit simulator?,1418176122,"Recently I've been working on a toy quantum circuit simulator, and I wanted some feedback and suggestions.

[**The simulator is here on jsfiddle**](http://jsfiddle.net/c4f5z73v/2/).

Instructions:

- Drag gates onto the wires.
- The center-right shows the probability of each individual wire being ON if measured at the end.
- The bottom-right shows the final state's amplitudes, layed out in a grid to be a bit more compact.
- Hover over a column to see its net operation, and the intermediate state.
- Combine the 'peek' gate with the control/anti-control gates to see conditional probabilities.
- Use the evolving/time-varying gates like X(t) to animate how a changing operation affects the output.

Some limitations you can complain about:

- Doesn't work on mobile (the touch events are wired up wrong, and there's hover hints)
- The only way to measure a wire is to controlled-not it into an unused wire (and then not operate on that second wire).
- Can't define custom gates
- Can't put two controlled operations in the same column, unless they have the same controls
- Can't save/load circuits
- Can't add qubits
- Can't scroll to the right; effectively limiting the size of the circuit

4387,"Our ""colour-blind"" perception of time: How to rebuild memory into Qu-bits",1416812074,"One of the leading controversies or inherent paradoxes of quantum mechanics is that multiple possibilities exist. In layman's terms, we have a choice of either tea or biscuits for lunch, and we chose one in real time, our course of action has one path, not all paths simultaneously. In other words, our perception of time is linear. 

However, what if time is non-linear? As a colour-blind person, one cannot see reds and browns, nor distinguish between reds and greens. What if our perception of time is that of a colour-blind person? We cannot see the multiple layers of time because our sight is linear. 

In fact, let's say all possibilities exist on a non-linear trajectory, crisscrossing at different planes of the space-time continuum, and all actions and events have that ""spooky"" connection that Einstein imagined. 

If so, then we can predict the future- because the future isn't really the future- it is on a parallel plane of non-linear time in which we cannot discern yet- although it is there and exists simultaneously. 

So my question is: How would you rebuild memory in Qu-bits? So far lots of organisations are attempting to build the first commercial Quantum Computer- D-WAVE, Google, BrainWave, et al not including the NSA. If we were to be able to utilise a complex version of the most available quantum computer- namely our ""brains"" which also process information via quantum mechanics- how would we re-wire a commercial version by mimicking the way our brains work in conjunction to how to translate the Qu-bits into electrodes, perception, memory, and  other tools by integration with classical binary computers that have a linear perception of events? 

If you were to begin to build it, how would you begin?

If so, then we can predict the future- because the future isn't really the future- it is on a parallel plane of non-linear time in which we cannot discern yet- although it is there and exists simultaneously. 

So my question is: How would you rebuild memory in Qu-bits? So far lots of organisations are attempting to build the first commercial Quantum Computer- D-WAVE, Google, BrainWave, et al not including the NSA. If we were to be able to utilise a complex version of the most available quantum computer- namely our ""brains"" which also process information via quantum mechanics- how would we re-wire a commercial version by mimicking the way our brains work in conjunction to how to translate the Qu-bits into electrodes, perception, memory, and  other tools by integration with classical binary computers that have a linear perception of events? 

If you were to begin to build it, how would you begin?

From http://physics.about.com/od/quantumphysics/f/quantumcomp.htm:

&gt; *The exact physical mechanism at work within the quantum computer is somewhat theoretically complex and intuitively disturbing. Generally, it is explained in terms of the multi-world interpretation of quantum physics, wherein the computer performs calculations not only in our universe but also in other universes simultaneously, while the various qubits are in a state of quantum decoherence.*

And from http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/writing/PCW/q2.htm:

&gt; *The amazing power of the quantum computer stems from the fact that if you have a collection of qubits – a register – in which each qubit is in an indeterminate state, then the register effectively represents all possible numbers at once. If you then perform a single computation on the register, the computation works on every possible number, simultaneously. David Deutsch explains the process using the idea of parallel universes – although we see only the single register in our universe, it actually exists in many other universes too, one for each of its possible states. By operating on the register in our universe, we kick off computations in all the other unseen universes, and then magically retrieve the answer.*

Assuming the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, does this mean that a quantum computer is capable of considering all possible solutions to a problem simultaneously because it delegates the consideration of (calculations for) each possible solution to a different universe?",260

4462,One Redditors guide to learning Quantum Computing,1396822643,"**Me**

First a bit about who I am, and where I am coming from. I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science. My education (Bachelor's and Master's) is in computer science. I have always been interested in Physics (from Astronomy to Quantum Mechanics (QM)) but I have never taken a class in Physics. Even my math background is limited, only taking a handful of basic math courses throughout my education. 

Yet, my PhD is in Quantum Computing (QC). This is a bit of a dilemma because I have never been taught many (all?) of the important foundational principles behind QC.  And, for various reasons, I am responsible for teaching QC to myself -- and this is how I am doing it. I hope that anyone looking to learn QC will find this helpful.

**A starting place** 

The most challenging part. With so much to learn, where do you start? On top of that, how can you start with the basics without losing motivation? I recommend starting by learning about the big picture, for this:

[The age of entanglement: When quantum physics was reborn; Louisa Gilder](http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Entanglement-Quantum-Physics/dp/1400095263/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396750675&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=age+of+entanglement+when+quantum+physics+was+reborn).

*	A great book to understand how the quantum world started, who started it, why it was necessary (important!), and how it has and is developing. Audiobook available.

Richard Feynman - The Character of Physical Law - Part 6 Probability and Uncertainty

*	Feynman, a man with near deity status among physicist.  Great speaker, old talk but absolutely correct, and informative.
*	[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAgcqgDc-YM) or [Microsoft TUVA (Better quality + diagrams)](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/)

What the bleep do we know: Double slit experiment

*	The best description and demonstration of the double slit experiment I know
*	[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc)

Google + NASA: QuAIL Lab video

*	Just an awesome video
*	[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMdHDHEuOUE)
 

**The goal** 

Ok, now that you are really interested in learning about QC, where do we actually start? Well, some might disagree with me, but start reading scientific papers. 

[ArXiv: Quantum Physics](http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new)

*	ArXiv is the standard location for most quantum computing papers. They are not peer reviewed, but are up immediately (better than the usual 1 year wait for publishing!!). Also free to public, no university proxy needed. [http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new](http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new)

[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.ca/) 

* Think of a topic &amp; Google it. Or search general QC and pick out things you find interesting. [http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Quantum+computing](http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Quantum+computing)

This will be hard -- you will not understand everything in any paper (that’s ok, you’re not suppose to!), but it will give several things. 

1.	A goal to work towards (to understand these papers, and maybe write one)
2.	What the current research in the field is 
3.	Many different ways of explaining the basics (via introductions)
4.	An idea of what you need to learn. 

Read abstracts, introductions, and the related work sections of as many papers you can, this will provide many different ways of explaining the same things. Follow citations to find which other papers are important. Here is a paper to start with (D-Wave device focused):

* A Near-Term Quantum Computing Approach… [http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2821](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2821) 


**Prerequisites**

QM and thus QC are based in linear algebra. You will need to have a VERY strong understanding of linear algebra to make any headway in QC – all QC textbooks assume you know basic linear algebra; they then build upon that to teach you the required advanced topics. I needed to relearn linear algebra to do this: 

[Khan’s Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

*	Expect 25+ hours of video lectures; surprisingly, all are important. This will give you the required foundations of linear algebra.
*	[https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra ) 

**Learning QC** 

Finally we can get to learning about QC. For textbooks I suggest the following:

[Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists; Yanofsky &amp; Mannucci](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396752221&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=quantum+computing+for+computer+scientists)

* This took my background in CS into account and tailored the material accordingly. A great starting book. This also has many practice problems, with their solutions! Also, has a great first section on complex numbers, which I did not know, but is important.

[An introduction to Quantum Computing; Kaye et al.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Computing-Phillip-Kaye/dp/019857049X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396753325&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=an+introduction+to+quantum+computing)

* I found the previous book easier to work through, but this provides another perspective to learn from. Also has some different material.

[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information; Nielsen &amp; Chuang](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-Anniversary-Edition/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396753160&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=2.+Quantum+Computation+and+Quantum+Information)

* Generally regarded as the ‘QC Bible’, difficult to read, but an indispensable reference.


**Some classes/lectures** 

UoWaterloo: Introduction to Quantum Information Processing (QIC 710)

*	Unfortunately not a video lecture series, but it does have lecture slides, assignments and some project ideas. Uses books 2 and 3 from my list above.

**Keeping you motivated** 

Through all of this, it might be easy to lose motivation, to combat this I highly suggest the following books (or audiobooks if you prefer).

[A short history of nearly everything; Bill Bryson](http://www.amazon.com/A-Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/076790818X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396818144&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+short+history+of+nearly+everything)

*	Has a great part on the Quantum revolution

[Surely you’re joking Mr. Feynman: Adventures of a curious character; Richard P. Feynman](http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396818294&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Surely+you%E2%80%99re+joking+Mr.+Feynman)

*	Feynman. What more can I say. This, along with his other books are all great reads.

[The fabric of the cosmos; Brian Greene](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fabric-Cosmos-Texture-Reality/dp/0375727205/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396818328&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+fabric+of+the+cosmos)

*	Illustrates the true depth of how important (or at least weird) the quantum world is and it's context to the rest of science.
	
[Einstein: His life and universe; Walter Isaacson](http://www.amazon.com/Einstein-Life-Universe-Walter-Isaacson/dp/0743264746/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396818416&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Einstein%3A+His+life+and+universe)

*	Why not learn about the man who started it all?

First a bit about who I am, and where I am coming from. I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science. My education (Bachelor's and Master's) is in computer science. I have always been interested in Physics (from Astronomy to Quantum Mechanics (QM)) but I have never taken a class in Physics. Even my math background is limited, only taking a handful of basic math courses throughout my education. 

Yet, my PhD is in Quantum Computing (QC). This is a bit of a dilemma because I have never been taught many (all?) of the important foundational principles behind QC.  And, for various reasons, I am responsible for teaching QC to myself -- and this is how I am doing it. I hope that anyone looking to learn QC will find this helpful.

**A starting place** 

The most challenging part. With so much to learn, where do you start? On top of that, how can you start with the basics without losing motivation? I recommend starting by learning about the big picture, for this:

[The age of entanglement: When quantum physics was reborn; Louisa Gilder](http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Entanglement-Quantum-Physics/dp/1400095263/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396750675&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=age+of+entanglement+when+quantum+physics+was+reborn).

*	A great book to understand how the quantum world started, who started it, why it was necessary (important!), and how it has and is developing. Audiobook available.

Richard Feynman - The Character of Physical Law - Part 6 Probability and Uncertainty

*	Feynman, a man with near deity status among physicist.  Great speaker, old talk but absolutely correct, and informative.
*	[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAgcqgDc-YM) or [Microsoft TUVA (Better quality + diagrams)](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/)

What the bleep do we know: Double slit experiment

*	The best description and demonstration of the double slit experiment I know

Google + NASA: QuAIL Lab video

*	Just an awesome video
*	[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMdHDHEuOUE)
 

**The goal** 

Ok, now that you are really interested in learning about QC, where do we actually start? Well, some might disagree with me, but start reading scientific papers. 

[ArXiv: Quantum Physics](http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new)

*	ArXiv is the standard location for most quantum computing papers. They are not peer reviewed, but are up immediately (better than the usual 1 year wait for publishing!!). Also free to public, no university proxy needed. [http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new](http://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new)

[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.ca/) 

* Think of a topic &amp; Google it. Or search general QC and pick out things you find interesting. [http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Quantum+computing](http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Quantum+computing)

This will be hard -- you will not understand everything in any paper (that’s ok, you’re not suppose to!), but it will give several things. 

1.	A goal to work towards (to understand these papers, and maybe write one)
2.	What the current research in the field is 
3.	Many different ways of explaining the basics (via introductions)
4.	An idea of what you need to learn. 

Read abstracts, introductions, and the related work sections of as many papers you can, this will provide many different ways of explaining the same things. Follow citations to find which other papers are important. Here is a paper to start with (D-Wave device focused):

* A Near-Term Quantum Computing Approach… [http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2821](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2821) 


**Prerequisites**

QM and thus QC are based in linear algebra. You will need to have a VERY strong understanding of linear algebra to make any headway in QC – all QC textbooks assume you know basic linear algebra; they then build upon that to teach you the required advanced topics. I needed to relearn linear algebra to do this: 

[Khan’s Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

*	Expect 25+ hours of video lectures; surprisingly, all are important. This will give you the required foundations of linear algebra.
*	[https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra ) 

**Learning QC** 

Finally we can get to learning about QC. For textbooks I suggest the following:

[Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists; Yanofsky &amp; Mannucci](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396752221&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=quantum+computing+for+computer+scientists)

* This took my background in CS into account and tailored the material accordingly. A great starting book. This also has many practice problems, with their solutions! Also, has a great first section on complex numbers, which I did not know, but is important.

[An introduction to Quantum Computing; Kaye et al.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Computing-Phillip-Kaye/dp/019857049X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396753325&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=an+introduction+to+quantum+computing)

* I found the previous book easier to work through, but this provides another perspective to learn from. Also has some different material.

[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information; Nielsen &amp; Chuang](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-Anniversary-Edition/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396753160&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=2.+Quantum+Computation+and+Quantum+Information)

* Generally regarded as the ‘QC Bible’, difficult to read, but an indispensable reference.

4463,How can we manipulate qubits without destroying the superposition?,1395784368,"Hello everyone,

I'm interested in Quantum Physics, and a few weeks ago I've started gathering informations about quantum computing. I've found it extremely interesting, but unfortunately also very hard to grasp.  I'm confused especially with the process of writing and reading information on qubits in the form of a single particles such as electrons.

I've always thought that the superposition exists only when there is no decoherence=no interactions=no measurements, however when we try to prepare the electron for computation we have to manipulate with its spin by applying magnetic field, microwave etc. 

As far as I know the superposition comes from the Schrodingers equation which represents a quantum probability wave, and the only thing we can do with it, is to collapse by observing, or if you prefer interact with it. I've really never thought there is a way to manpulate with the superposition, so I'm extremely confused right now.

I know there are some superconducting materials which can allow in some conditions (low temperature) to settle the particles down, and thus reveal and retain the qantum behaviour, but how can we manipulate with the superposition without destroying it?
 

 I'd like to ask about something more. I know that apart from the classical approach there are also other methods such as quantum annealing. So what is the difference between the quantum anealing and the cassical approach? 

In clasical approach probably it is necesary to have a fully entangled system in the opposite of quantm annealing, but I'm not completely sure.

Does the quantum annealing approach require gates?

I know there are people who understand the concept really well, I would be grateful if some of you could give me possible simple explanation. 

Would you recommend books about quantum computers, but not academic. I mean books written by popularizers of science. ",QuantumComputing,BlackSchrodingersCat,9,Quantum,Post,"How can we manipulate qubits without destroying the superposition? Hello everyone,

Basic Quantum Idea

Imagine you have a particle gun. You shoot it at a sensor that detects when it is hit with the particle. Call this sensor A. You fire the gun, A lights up, as expected.

Now, you introduce a second sensor, B. This is positioned in such a way that if you put a mirror in the path of the gun and sensor A at a 45 degree angle, the particle will bounce off the mirror, and hit sensor B.

You add the mirror, and sure enough, every time you fire the gun, sensor B lights up.

Now, replace the mirror with a mirror that has a bunch of holes poked in it. Such that there is now a 50/50 change that when the gun fires, the particle will either pass through one of the holes, and hit A, or reflect off the mirror and hit B. You fire up the gun a bunch, and sure enough, you get a 50/50 pattern of A's and B's: ABBABABBABABBBAABABBAA

Now, behind the mirror, and in front of A, you place a wall that would block any particle. So, when a particle passes through a hole in the mirror, it would then hit the wall, and never reach A. You would expect to see a 50/50 pattern like this: B--B-B--B-B-B--BB-B, because the wall is blocking anything from ever getting to A. But with quantum physics, this isn't the case. It is almost as if the particle is intelligent.

""Since I can never reach A, I'll go to B every time."" says the particle. So, the pattern that emerges is: BBBBBBBBBB.

This can be rephrased as such: Since B is the only possible outcome in our reality, the quantum particle will manifest that way, every time. Now, let's apply this idea to quantum computing:
Let's build a quantum computer

You setup your quantum processor with qubits and the like. You want to crack an asymmetrical cipher. So, you setup parameters such that you have the cyphertext, and you know that the plaintext is probably a message readable by a human. You enter these parameters into your quantum compy, and boom! In a single clock cycle, you have the key. How? Because the qubits will only manifest themselves in a way that is possible in our reality, which in this case is the correct key to unencrypt the message.

Is all crypto broken?

Not at all. Encryption based on public/private keys, shared secrets, etc., is all easily broken with quantum computing. However, non-deterministic algorithms (such as using a true one-time random pad of numbers) is not broken. This goes back to the quantum idea: If it is impossible to determine a single possibility (non deterministic), then anything could be the outcome. While, conversely, if only a single outcome is possible (there is only one passcode that will successfully unencrypt the data), then quantum computing will manifest that single possibility.

4489,"I'm new to the idea of quantum computing, is my idea of it correct?",1388524462,"After listening to multiple people explain what quantum computing is, it kind  of makes it sound as if it is taking the desired output and working out what input you would need to get that value when calculated.

So if I take the inverse of factoring (multiplying numbers together), I could basically program a quantum computer to 'multiply numbers together' and give it a desired output (lets say 12 for example or binary 1100) and it could try multipling 10 numbers together with 4 qubits each so

0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 

but these are apparently not just 1 or 0, but both so (b = both)

bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb

and if you were to multiply all of them together it would produce multiple results in parallel and you would just have to pick out the result that was equal to the desired answer. (I am a little fuzzy on how this would work)

So you would end up calculating a large number of multiplications in parallel where one or more of the answers would be 12, from that you then somehow get the

I will be taking a couple of courses on the subject during this upcoming year, but I was wondering what resources do you know of that might help me in learning as much as possible on this subject.

So far I've been able to find:

D-wave tutorial on quantum computers
Michael Nielsens course on quantum computation
Perimeter scholars lectures on quantum information
edx course on quantum mechanics and quantum computation
