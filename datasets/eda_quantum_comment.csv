1,"3-SAT is NP-complete, and we don't expect to be able to solve it efficiently even using quantum computers. We can get a quadratic speedup using Grover's algorithm which would give us a run time of O(1.414^n), but we can do better clasically with O(1.307^n)[1]. If you're interested in solving real industry optimization problems any time soon with a quantum computer, well, that may take a while. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm  (QAOA) is an interesting variational quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems that runs on near-term devices, but its speedup is still an open research question.

I personally don't yet see any near-term useful applications for quantum computing with entangled state photons or squeeze state photons or other current versions of QC.

&amp;#x200B;

I do, however, see near term potential in photonic neural nets, photonic neuromorphic computing, and classical photonic computing or photon enhanced classical computing. I believe there is far more value in these fields for the near term.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, can you give me any insight you may have about the actual benefit of a functional general quantum computer like that provided by Xanadu. Or what is the right next step for demonstrating photonic supremacy in something like neuromorphic, neural net, or photon enhanced computing.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I used some non existent terms like photonic supremacy and photon enhanced computing but I think you get what I mean.

&amp;#x200B;

Photon enhanced computing being something like this:

[https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wed1015-riscv-sunchen-1-6-2016.pdf](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wed1015-riscv-sunchen-1-6-2016.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

This goes into computer science theory which I am not well versed in but will get to learn if I feel is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the issues with the theoretical optical neural net is how many layers of optical components can a mode make it through, if you have a switch of some sort to either turn off or on the transmission, there will be significant signal loss as you go. So why can't we use repeaters? As many repeaters as we like? This will of course potentially introduce latency issues as the light which is repeated is delayed if it is an active repeater or the mode integrity is compromised with a passive repeater. But if the signal is only binary, the mode integrity doesn't matter, and if the system is a neural net, perhaps the latency issue introduced by active repeaters is not relevant since the net will morph according to its internal function with something like reinforcement learning.

Is there something I am missing fundamentally here which makes the proposed neural net idea not reasonable? I understand on-chip manufacturing is not exactly where we want it to be but there is a lot of recent developments in integrated photonics that don't make this idea impossible, from sensors to sources.

It seems you've been well-read on this topic and I'd appreciate any thoughts you may have.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to COMSOL, Sentaurus TCAD, Sentaurus RSOFT, and Lumerical as potential simulation platforms for this work.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess at a fundamental level, I believe there is so much physics to exploit with integrated photonics that we should be able to introduce massive leaps in computation technology with proper implementation without having to deal with boson sampling or Gaussian boson sampling.",1615979959,QuantumComputing,Anasoori,Quantum,Comment,457

It’s a difficult task, but in principle it seems possible. In fact, the disorder can be about 100 times larger than what’s currently found in GaAs structures, so it seems possible that the InAs or InSb structures can be grown clean enough with enough improvements. Maybe there is some reason the system can’t be made that clean though that I don’t know.",1615947515,QuantumComputing,SciGuy24,Quantum,Comment,84

Most research in quantum information is at the graduate level. Because of this, your undergraduate institution doesn't matter a whole lot as long as you have opportunities to learn physics well *and get research experience* (whether it's in quantum computing or not). 

At my university, there is one professor who runs a quantum information research group--my research advisor. None of the other faculty do anything close. I am the fourth student he has advised that has been interested in quantum computing; the other three were apparently students he advised in the 1990s. Despite this, I have been able to do a good amount of research and have gotten one, soon to be two publications on it. My university doesn't have any sort of quantum computing class, but that hasn't been much of a hindrance.

157,"In a nutshell, quantum mechanics uses a LOT of linear algebra. You represent the state of your system as a vector and you make changes to that system using an operator, which is commonly represented as a matrix. However quantum mechanics uses a notation called bra-ket notation which is pretty unique to the field. 

Bra-ket notation is basically a shorthand for writing vectors. This becomes convenient because once we know the effect of an operator we don’t need to write out the matrix and vector components explicitly; for example, we know that the X gate in a quantum computer swaps your state, so you could just write 

X|0&gt; = |1&gt;     or     X|1&gt; = |0&gt;

But the matrices give you a way to figure out how each state is changed by that particular operator.

The statistical nature of QM is there; the question of when (or if) a neuron fires will obviously involve QM, but only in the sense that it's a probabilistic thing.

So far (again, from what I've read) there's no need for a theory of interference or superpositions, or wavefunctions in general, to explain (to the extent that we can explain) the brain.  It seems that every model we have (again, again, I'm no expert)  about the brain can treat QM as if the indeterminacy in QM is just a lack of knowledge about the true state, or an inability to compute the true state (due to its complexity). Without actually getting into the true  reasons for indeterminacy in QM. Similar to classical stat-mech, fluid-dynamics, etc.

There is no known way to make two photons interact in this way, but it has been discovered that you can randomly create products and eliminate incorrect results. This means photonic quantum gates must be provided massive numbers of entangled photons and are non-deterministic.

Yes, you should put Paulis into your circuit to mitigate errors on noisy devices. This is called spin echo. The Paulis act like a high pass filter, removing low frequency noise. For example, suppose that while your computer is running every qubit is drifting around the Z axis by 1 degree per time step. Each Pauli X effectively negates the direction of the drift, so instead of errors adding like  +1+1+1+1... under spin echo they cancel out like +1-1+1-1+1-1... .",1615230475,QuantumComputing,Strilanc,Quantum,Comment,83

279,"&gt;Broadly speaking I roughly think I understand it as a narrower field than traditional digital Boolean logic, as qubits are more like matrix simulations within closed boxes.

Maybe I don't understand what you mean, but I wouldn't say QC is narrower than Boolean logic. In the practical sense, sure, we probably won't build a general purpose processer out of qubits. But this fact isn't because qubits are fundamentally more narrow than regular bits, rather it's because of the engineering challenges of qubits. You wouldn't build a supercomputer to run Minecraft for practical reasons, not because the super computer is more narrow than your Dell laptop.

&gt;With something like GPT3, they haven’t hit the limits of over parameterization yet, it’s currently hitting more of a machine limit than the data set or systems

I'd argue that throwing more compute / data at GPT-3 won't lead to significant strides in its ability. GPT-3 is impressive, but for every good example of its performance, there is an example of the limited-ness of its ability and it's not clear more data would significantly break through these limits.

I can't comment on QC and brain analysis, but a QC seems like it will be helpful for simulating chemistry and quantum systems because quantum mechanics plays an important role in these applications. The brain, as far as we know, does not rely on quantum mechanics to function and so QC would may have to be useful in a different way for it to apply to that kind of application.",1615219043,QuantumComputing,timthebaker,Quantum,Comment,253

On the contrary, an Aristotelian might think that mathematics is an arbitrary system of thought which holds no importance to reality other than that it can approximate physical reality pretty well.

It would be true whether or not anybody ever worked it out. So it isn't invented, it's discovered.

Today, we'll put that all to use. We'll take a look at how to turn our abstract ideas into circuits, then code, overcoming hurdles along the way. Diving into complex topics like Amplitude Amplification - exactly how to come up with it, mathematically finding the number of iterations needed, and how to implement it in a circuit.   
From visualisations to code, this guide covers the entire journey, and makes sure you know the *why* behind every step. Instead of just copying and pasting code, I highly encourage you to write your own code first - afterwards, feel free to check against examples.

369,"I am not sure why you are getting the impression that superconducting and ion trap based QC are not as promising as photonic.  In fact, before the recent progress in boson sampling almost no one thought that universal QCs would be best suited for photonic implementation.  There are still a lot of challenges needed to be tackled. 

Here are some main things that need to be addressed to advance photonic QC:

 very low loss, high speed reconfigurable logic gates, 

ideally integrated on chip, either silicon or lithium niobate are are main platforms.   there is a TON of research in fabrication which is applicable to both classical and quantum light based computing.  

Increasing the efficiencies of single photon detectors, creating good photon number resolving detectors, reducing the costs, possibly integrating single photon detectors on chip. 

on demand and indistinguishable level quantum photonic sources such as single photons.  For single photons, these can be done using quantum dot based sources, spontaneous nonlinear processes such as spontaneous parametric down conversion and spontaneous four wave mixing.   The later need to be multiplexed together for on demand emission as they are highly probabilistic with low probability (going above 5% very quickly degrades the fidelity of a single photon state with this approach, but it is good for other reasons you can read into).   All of this has made it a pipe-dream for people to achieve meaningful photonic quantum computers.   Only recently were quantum dots and integrated photonics done impressive boson sampling, and then this past year the Gaussian boson sampling paper achieved quantum suprememacy.   Gaussian boson sampling uses squeezed states, which can be created on demand and thus solves a lot of the issues I stated above.  

But again, it isn’t re-programmable, you can’t perform say, Shor’s algorithm on the Gaussian boson sampling device they built.  However, Google’s quantum computer they used for quantum supremacy can be programmed to do Shor’s, grover’s whatever whatever algorithms more “easily.”   So those are some challenges and important issues needed to make photonic quantum computers the leading candidate.  I’m not convinced quite yet they will be, however the recent boson sampling papers have been surprising to me.   I did not think we would beat quantum supremacy with a photonic based QC this early, so we will see.",1614096055,QuantumComputing,vacuum_state,Quantum,Comment,378
370,"I don't know if I follow. I agree they had a lot of problems with errors but I am unsure what you mean by disable to make operational or ""sharing quantum gates"". 


The errors they were running into were, as I understood, essentially fundamental microscopic defects that occur stochastically in the frequency spectrum of any given transmon. The two qubit gate they were using required tuning two transmons that were next to each other physically to the same frequency from some idle frequency. However, when frequency tuning a transmon you may pass through one of these coupled defects and get hit by either a coherent or incoherent swap of the qubit excitation. For a few qubits, one can kind of find an optimal point for the right device. However, they were optimizing a 72 qubit array, and finding  optimal biasing to maximize 2Q gate fidelity while avoiding T1 dropouts was essentially impossible. 

There is a paper by Paul Klimov that explores this issue although they don't explicitly state this was the major challenge in operating bristlecone. He did discuss it more frankly at march meeting in 2019 and basically said this is a really hard optimization problem. 

The paper is here:https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01043
A related work that I found insanely cool: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08246

Anyway, that is my understanding of the matter. It does not negate the fact they made a 72 qubit device. I would not be surprised if they are going for higher counts with the coupler technology instead (sycamore chip).",1614061835,QuantumComputing,NSubsetH,Quantum,Comment,249

Sure, quantum annealers can factorize prime numbers. The question is, can they do it any faster than classical computers?

My synopsis of the article (from a previous post)

Presumptions:

* They're using D-Wave hardware.
* Deciphering the Strongest AES a few years from now could easily mean they've already broken the weakest.
* When they speak of hash algo's they are probably talking about SHA class of ciphers.

Implications:

* 20-year security requirements of Top Secret/yada yada is at risk.
* When they can break SHA-256, Bitcoin &amp; alt crypto's are worth 0.
* Their quantum algo could be revolutionary or this is a fluff piece (with 80 quantum physicists?)

Known Unknowns:

* Who's going to trust a swiss encryption company after Crypto AG. Them claiming other cryptos are bad &amp; theirs is good might be a clue. A PoC that breaks other cryptos could alleviate concerns.
* What have they already broken?
* How many annealing qubits are required to break SHA-128, SHA-256, AES at large, with their algos? Are they just following Rose Law (Moores law for quantum - not sure if this is still an in use term).

If you aim at understanding and designing quantum algorithms, quantum mechanics is to quantum computing what electronics is to classical algorithms: it's a plus, if you want to know what's going on behind the scenes, but in no way necessary, You need to understand what transformations you can apply to the system to perform computing, and this requires linear algebra.
Just to make an example, you will never find Schrödinger's equation in a quantum algorithm, because you are not concerned with how to apply potentials to drive the evolution and the containment of a single qubit: it's already been taken care of.
On the other hand, quantum computing is still young, and a grasp of the underlying physics can be useful in proposing new paradigms of computation, or extending the current ones.",1613891794,QuantumComputing,rasomuro,Quantum,Comment,135
427,"The most basic implementation of entanglement uses only two quantum gates, the Hadamard and the CNOT. See here for more details [https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-gates/multiple-qubits-entangled-states.html](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-gates/multiple-qubits-entangled-states.html) particularly section 3.1

The whole power of quantum computation comes from what happens to your qubits in between measurements. For the duration of the quantum algorithm you don't want to be checking the state at all, so you're basically blindly interacting with it and trusting that it is behaving as you expect it to. (This of course all depends on the actual implementation. In fact there is a version of QC called measurement-based quantum computation that pretty much only uses entanglement and measurement, without any other gates. But most general descriptions of QC are gate-based so that's what you're more likely to come across.) The art of writing a quantum algorithm is to choose the right kind and sequence of interactions so that what you get at the end, when you finally allow yourself to measure your qubit register, is most likely to be the solution to whatever your problem was. I know this sounds like a cheat but it is possible.

Regarding conditional statements like if/then, on the one hand they are not strictly part of gate-based QC but there is nothing stopping you building a hybrid quantum/classical computer to include them at a higher level. On the other hand there is a sense in which quantum computation is like implementing the whole conditional at once. For example, you might have two bits and you want to do something like the following: if bit A is 0, then do nothing to bit B, else if bit A is 1 then flip bit B. Now in QC we could do the same thing in the following way: put qubit A in a superposition of 0 and 1 (using, say, a Hadamard gate), then flip qubit B conditional on the value of qubit A (using, say, a CNOT gate). What results is a state of your qubit register that encodes the result of the whole if-statement, not just one part of it like in the classical case. From here as I said above the trick is to use the fact that you now have all the information from the whole if-evaluation and somehow feed that in to the rest of your quantum algorithm in a clever way, without worrying about the actual outcome from running the if-statement.

Seeing as you have programming experience I encourage you to browse through the Qiskit textbook link and play around with the examples they go through.

This is sommmme explanation.  I kinda think i understand it!!!

I read this slowly like 6 times.  So cool.

This blew my mind: *""Entanglement doesn’t have a material existence in the same way that an  electron has a material existence. It doesn’t even exist in the same way the spin exists as a property of a material object (the electron).  Entanglement is more like a property of properties of many electrons. ""*

Not sure if this is in your area of expertise but since this is the quantum computing reddit....   How can such an elusive property -- at it's essence be harnessed into computer logic?

If your going to evaluate the state of a bit traditionally, you check it's value and your logic gate goes on it's merry way.

Quantum Gates would seem to have no path in say and if/then statement inside of a traditional program.

497,"Cool I'm an undergrad physics cse student myself so I'm sort of in the same boat but I've designed a superconducting quantum computer and made a couple of interesting quantum programs so I'll tell you about what's worked for me.

So if you're an electrical engineer you probably want to engineering the actual circuits. This is going to be VERY tough tho, because the circuits are inherently quantum mechanical. Not impossible, but just tough.  You'd have to read introductory quantum mechanics like ""intro to quantum mechanics"" by Griffith. And then you'll want to look for a good place to learn circuit-QED Which is how to do electrical engineering with quantum circuits. I've found some really good stuff on arxiv for this.

A quick overview of circuit-qed is... We have a bose-einstein condensate of cooper pairs of electrons. Because of this, the very position and momentum of the electrons become quantum mechanical and behave coherently.  This means that the position/charge of the circuit, Q, and the momentum/current of the circuit, I, become quantum operators and behave by the schrodinger equation.  You then add a new special circuit element called a josephson junction to create nonlinearity in your equations.  My favorite part about all of this is that you can watch your macroscopic circuits create a little multiverse, which is pretty rare in qm.


On the programming side you want to probably learn QISKIT in python. There's a few historic algorithms like the quantum fourier transform and grovers algorithm that you should learn. All of quantum computing's power comes from quantum parrellism, or that the dimensionality of a system multiplies through entanglement. For example, if I have two 3d quantum systems and let them interact, I'll end up with a 9d entangled system. If you follow the multiverse interpretation then you can think of the excessive dimensionality of this as other ""universes"" of the system.  This is useful to think like, because stuff like grovers algorithm can be thought of as ""searching the multiverse"" for the answer to your question.  

For programming, QISKIT has a FANTASTIC website and sooo many great tutorials. So just go on there and you'll have plenty of resources.",1613453705,QuantumComputing,Northerneye,Quantum,Comment,361

500,"What I mean by the electron being a local object is to think of it in the particle sense, in the way Newton would have thought of electrons. This is a picture that has certain conveniences, but fails to account for the complete nature of electrons, since they are known to have wave-like properties too. 

The spin of an electron is a property that it has, in addition to the electron having the property that it exists somewhere in space. Think of it like spinning a basketball on your finger. Once you get it spinning (in either one of two directions) you can walk around as you please and the spinning basketball will be carried by your finger. The basketball has a location in space that changes over time, but it also has a spin direction which doesn't depend on where it is in space.

Any property of an electron that you can observe is a property that can be made to be entangled with the same property in another electron. So even the location of an electron is something that can be entangled (this makes more sense if you think of an electron as a wave, which might have a number of peaks at different points in space). But for your purposes I think it is easier to consider the spin of two electrons as the property that you entangle. 

I want to get to all of your points, but it will take a little bit to build up this analogy. Say you and I want to “entangle” the spin of two basketballs. We place them on a pair of gears attached to a motor, and the direction that the motor turns is randomly chosen. The point of using gears is that when gears mesh they turn in opposite directions, so you and I know that whatever way the motor happens to turn, the two gears will turn oppositely, which means the two basketballs will be spinning in opposite directions. 

To reiterate, this device not only gets both basketballs spinning, but it does so in a way that the direction of spin of each basketball is correlated. (In reality the spin of an electron is already there, and the entanglement process can be thought of as just adjusting the direction of spin of two electrons so that they are correlated.) 

Now this next part is going to sound silly. To capture the weirdness of entanglement, you and I need to be wearing blindfolds when we entangle the spin of the two basketballs. Once this gear-motor device has got the balls spinning, it (somehow) places one on your finger and the other on my finger. Now no matter where you happen to walk, or where I happen to walk, it will always be the case that the two basketballs are spinning in opposite directions. But because we are both wearing blindfolds I don’t know which way my basketball is spinning, and neither do you know the direction of spin of your basketball.

Ok now suppose we have already established an agreed upon pair of endpoints that we each will walk to (again, somehow we can do this while wearing blindfolds). So we each walk to our designated point, say at two opposite ends of a basketball court. Now once we are there, in either order we can remove our blindfolds are observe the direction of spin of the basketball we happen to be holding. As soon as I see that my basketball spins left-to-right, I immediately know that yours spins right-to-left. Alternatively, I may see that my basketball spins right-to-left, in which case I immediately know that yours spins left-to-right. Once we meet again we can compare our observations, and in every repeat of this process we will always see that the spins were oppositely correlated. The actual direction that either one of us sees in each run of this process is random, like flipping a coin, but the correlation between the two spins is the same every time.

Now I’m going to shoot holes in this analogy to show where it doesn’t align with how entanglement really works. Firstly, the motor-gear device will either spin one way or spin the other, so that there is always a definite direction that the basketballs are spinning once they are placed on our fingers. In reality there is no fact of the matter about which direction of spin an electron has before you observe it; the spin is said to be in an equal superposition of both directions. Secondly, even though you and I are wearing blindfolds, someone else may walk by and see both basketballs, take note of the way each is spinning, and deduce that there is a correlation, and do all this without either you or I knowing. In reality it is not possible for an external observer to “see” the entanglement that exists between two electron spins without observing either electron, after which case the entanglement will be destroyed anyway. Entanglement doesn’t have a material existence in the same way that an electron has a material existence. It doesn’t even exist in the same way the spin exists as a property of a material object (the electron). Entanglement is more like a property of properties of many electrons.",1613444693,QuantumComputing,GOD_Over_ramanuDjinn,Quantum,Comment,880

OK, credentials are merely credentials.

&gt; He's not engaging with the concerns of the people actually doing the science. He's just responding to news articles he's read.

Well, I realize that that is the takeaway that QC-optimists have and, even though I'm not a practicing quantum anything, I have a non-negligible understanding of what QC is, and I'm willing to venture that Borcherds does, as well. Credentialed quantum folks should resist the temptation to hide behind the robes of Father Feynman's quantum mystifications. The facts can be very complex (perhaps even arbitrarily complex), but the facts that *humans* can reason about are never so complex that they cannot be clearly communicated about with other humans. Credentials might facilitate such discussions but they are never an insurmountable obstacle for anyone determined to understand a subject.

&gt; Everyone in quantum computing is fully aware that the quantum supremacy experiments that have been performed are (1) not practically useful (2) tailored for quantum computers -- this isn't a genius insight.

Borcherds's teapot thought-experiment is a valuable tool for deflating the popular hype that is swirling among clueless observers. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, this swirling hype is being fueled by the permissive silence of those who know better and have the credentials to correct the popular discussion. Even the potential for multi-million dollar grants and VC-funding is a powerful disincentive against publicly campaigning against the out-of-control hype. Ordinary people will get hurt, as they always do in such financialized, speculative bubbles.

&gt; If he was actually thinking critically, and wanted to educate people, he would be asking why scientists are actually *excited* about the quantum supremacy experiments, instead of making bad faith arguments against strawmen.

It's not a strawman at all. Let's see a QC that can simulate the cracking of a teapot. We believe that QCs will be able to simulate such physical experiments far more efficiently than classical computers (and in a programmable way); but even if we had massive, high-qubit-count ECC QCs, probably the cheapest and easiest way to simulate the shattering of a teapot would still be to make a bunch of teapots and drop them. That's a massively significant fact about the nature of computation in our physical world. Current QC development seems to be following ""the path of greatest resistance."" Is QC research merely overlooking this?

Moreover, I don't see how to prove that whatever problem the teapot is solving can't be solved by classical computers. But proving that i.e. separation of complexity classes is precisely the whole point of quantum supremacy i.e. to separate complexity classes.  


Regardless I agree with him that the quantum supremacy hype can get a bit out of hand. Although there's a lot of effort and PR going into QC solving optimization problems, it's still unclear if QC actually provides any actual advantage over classical computers.",1613206600,QuantumComputing,WhataBeautifulPodunk,Quantum,Comment,156

""You have a QC and all you're doing is optimizing traffic? I mean come on.""

But optimizing is exactly the future of the majority of Q computations, is it not?

What is the optimal position of specific atoms in a material? And how can we optimize interactions with these other types of atoms? And how can these molecules be optimized when interacting with something like a cell wall or DNA structure? 

Or when you want to optimize a combustion chamber's functionality? 

Or when you want to optimize energy flow for something large for which you are about to produce millions/billions of units of to, say, efficiently absorb power from the sun?

QC will let us reduce the time (and cost, and probably most importantly: energy) that specific computations take to complete.

It is true that  the Q ""supremacy"" term has been thrown around, and this term should probably be refined such that you only claim supremacy for a *specific* function/algorithm/computation - AND you should probably include the time [and energy?] to set up your QC and run its shots compared to running it on your classical computer.

So the teapot helps illustrate the fallacy of claiming quantum supremacy, but I fear his statements about which kinds of things QCs will help with will become outdated sooner than he thinks.

Optimizing traffic is only a silly thing to do with a QC **until** the costs of optimizing are low enough such that your environment (Earth?) can benefit from future reduced savings in energy (and time!) 

If optimizing the fuel for internal combustion engines and optimizing traffic flows can reduce yearly pollution of those engines by even just 10%, this could easily spell several extra years worth of time to be able to reverse catastrophic situations like the extinction of species or slowing down weather changes so that everything can adapt in time before it just straight up dies off.",1613197768,QuantumComputing,WhyDoISuckAtW2,Quantum,Comment,319

566,"I think the issues raised about traffic control are super valid. However, a key point about quantum supremacy is missed. The issue is that the tea pot is not programable. [This is addressed by Scott Aaronson in his Quantum Supremacy FAQ](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317):

&gt;**Even so, there are countless examples of materials and chemical reactions that are hard to classically simulate, as well as special-purpose quantum simulators (like those of Lukin’s group at Harvard). Why don’t these already count as quantum computational supremacy?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Under some people’s definitions of “quantum computational supremacy,” they do! The key difference with Google’s effort is that they have a *fully programmable* device—one that you can program with an arbitrary sequence of nearest-neighbor 2-qubit gates, just by sending the appropriate signals from your classical computer.  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, it’s no longer open to the QC skeptics to sneer that, sure, there are quantum systems that are hard to simulate classically, but that’s just because *nature* is hard to simulate, and you don’t get to arbitrarily redefine whatever random chemical you find in the wild to be a “computer for simulating itself.” Under any sane definition, the superconducting devices that Google, IBM, and others are now building are indeed “computers.”",1613171471,QuantumComputing,HaxtesR,Quantum,Comment,202

571,"Yea acquisitions may be the best way to think about it. 

On the technology side, I think the broad consensus is that, when it comes to QC, the best way to think about it near to medium term (i.e. now to 20 year time horizon) is as falling under a coprocessor model of computing, like a GPU or FPGA. Add in the current (and possibly future) requirements around supporting infrastructure (e.g. dilution refrigerators) and the value of quantum algorithms being largely relegated to science/engineering problems in the near term (i.e. there’s no reason to think the average web developer will have a need for quantum algorithms, setting aside the quantum networking component), access through a cloud based model seems a good long term bet. 

The corollary is that we’ve spent 60 years optimizing classical computers across the stack; for quantum computers to provide operational value relative to a classical computer, the problem they’re addressing will have to be highly amenable to being solved using quantum information. Right now, quantum simulation is the best candidate, with industry applications  in material science, chemistry, drug discovery, etc. The best way to serve the needs of those industries given the expected constraints of the technology (through the eyes of the big companies) is through cloud-based access — it’s an expensive proposition with a hard to measure ROI to build your own quantum team and hardware to tackle, say, quantum optimizations for an in silico drug discovery pipeline.

576,"No, definitely not a crackpot. But I think we can use non-quantum (classical) physics to perform a good deal more useful computation than we tend to realize with casual reflection.

Digital computers are wonderful for exact computations. But most real-world problems only require (good) approximate solutions. To route deliveries, for example, you don't need to solve the TSP, you only need to get a good approximation. We're trying to shoehorn our ideas about ""what a computer is"" into too narrow of a shoe.

Suppose it really was important, for some reason, to answer the question of how many pieces a teapot cracks into. Well, just drop some teapots at various angles and find out. From a physical standpoint, experiments *are* computations (or parts of computations). At the BOM (bill-of-materials) price-point for cryogenic, Josephson-junction based QCs, such classical ""test-and-measure"" apparatuses for physical simulations are quite feasible. For example, we can imagine using a physical wind-tunnel with streamlines and a high-speed camera, then feeding that video data into a standard supercomputer to assist the DiffEq-based calculation.

654,"Disclaimer, I totally agree that current quantum computers are not useful and they have currently no commercial value. And the time span of 5 to 10 years is probably optimistic for ""useful"" quantum computers.

However, I don't think this quite is what Google showed, and I also don't like this argument of ""they haven't done anything useful therefore it is not working"".

First of, common, dropping a teapot gives an experimental value, it's the definition of being 100 % true and correct. Doing a calculation is not doing an experiment, in fact calculations exist so that we do not have to do experiments. If we could do experiments for everything we would, but that's not feasible nor possible.

# Cat vs Teapot approach:

If I showed you a cat that can solve a simple equation with the help of a laptop you wouldn't go ""oh, that's nothing, this is trivial"", you would probably think it is pretty cool that a cat can solve anything at all. Yeah, we could solve it faster without the cat, but it's a first and perhaps we can now train cats to do useful equations.

Then we see that the cat is actually better than any human in doing snowflake paintings while riding a unicycle. This is pretty interesting, still not useful, but this is something where we previously would not have had to train a human for a very long time and even then they would not have been this good at drawing snowflakes while riding a unicycle.

# Serious approach:

What Google showed was that we can do *something* faster on a quantum computer. Before this humanity, as a whole, could not do *any* computation faster than a classical computer. IBM's argument is fair, but should Google be able to add just a single qubit to their device, IBM would need to add a whole supercomputer extra. That's a football field-sized computer. Adding something like 33 qubits and you would have to cover the entire planet in supercomputers. Yes, it's not something that will have much use but it's a big milestone.

As for these optimization algorithms, yes, they would run faster without the quantum computer in the loop. But again, they show that we can run this with the current hardware, and that this is where we are at. 

Also, this is how quantum computers are intended to be used, as a device that can solve a very specific set of complex problems. You will not have a quantum computer that runs Word or that you can browse Reddit on. Quantum computers will do a small number of operations but will do them extremely well.",1612974897,QuantumComputing,slakeslak,Quantum,Comment,443

I guess he’s saying that a basic test is: Can a classical-computer-plus-teapot reasonably do a job that a classical-computer-plus-QC is demonstrating?  If so, it’s not a very good job to show QC value. 

I believe that is at the root of last year’s Google-IBM debate over quantum supremacy.  Google argued that their system could do a calculation that would take the IBM (classical) computer system eons, IBM replied that they could simply add memory and do the job in a couple of days.

664,"I’m simplifying this a bit. 

Imagine each qubit is a spinning top that never slows down. If you want a pulse that works right, the frequency of the pulse needs to match the frequency of the spinning top. If the frequency of the pulse doesn’t match the frequency of the qubit, the pulse will just scramble the qubit a little instead.

If the frequency matches, the phase is important. Remember how two water waves will add up and make a bigger wave if they are in phase? The peaks all line line up to make bigger peaks, and the troughs line up and make deeper troughs? If two waves are out of phase they cancel out. So the phase of the pulse and qubit have to match up or you don’t get what you want.

678,"Scale: the biggest reason. More below:

Durability: by marrying memory and processing in a single unit and scaling that instead of base speed: we have robustness in error tolerance - many units may fail until the system becomes unusable.

Extensibility: you can improve hardware by merely adding to the (probably) homogeneous structure of the computer.

True async parallelism: by not having a central unit to coordinate the processing units we prevent deadlocks: by fundamentally rethinking how we do things in parallel.By having a cpu moderate parallel behavior we can become locked, or even broken entirely if there is a bitflip. This is not true parallelism.


there are many other reasons: but the biggest is scale: we have nearly reached the fundamental limit to clock speed: where the biggest gains isn’t faster cpus, but more cores: by designing architecture that puts core count in the limelight: the scale we can achieve is ‘how many cores can we stick together’ which is orders of magnitude higher in computational gains than ‘how fast can we make each core go’

Languages like C and Python don’t truly allow safe parallelism.

I think Elixir might be the closest thing to a truly futuristic programming language.

At the moment I'm planning to implement non-adjacent qubit swaps by just moving the relevant qubits together using several swaps, then moving them back to their proper positions after the swap.

I think relabeling the qubits is probably no more feasible than what I've suggested, because I'm storing a full state vector rather than individual qubits. Maybe it is better; this is a project I've picked up after leaving for three years so there's sure to be an awful lot I've forgotten.

---
There might be a simpler way to implement these SWAP gates between any qubits though (although there won't be this nice one to one correspondence to the circuit as you desired). Something I have done in the few simulators I have written:

Just relabel the qubits.  Swapping qubits 2 and 7? Good, qubit 2 is now renamed to qubit 7, qubit 7 is renamed to qubit 2. No need to apply any huge matrix operation, you will have to keep track of the indices.  

---

Another trick you can do by creating the SWAP gate is look at the binary representation of the indices of a column (starting with index 0, so we have zeroth qubit)  

For example:  
If you swap qubit 1 and 3 in a 5 qubit state. Then for example on row 3 (00011), the '1' is placed on column 9 (01001), we swapped the first and third digit. A similar thing for the other 31 rows.

---

Depending on how you are saving the state you can apply the above directly on the state without building the operation.  

If saved as a Ket state you would do a similar thing, swap (amongst others) the third and ninth entry..  
If saved as Density Matrix I think you have to swap both the third and ninth row and column.

897,"&gt;Can you simplify your explanation of how the instrument/computer operates?

Take a look at [this animation](https://twitter.com/bencbartlett/status/1351967463609491458). The general idea is that by scattering the photon against the atom, you entangle it in such a way that when you rotate the state of the atom using a laser pulse and then measure the atomic state, the measurement teleports an analogous rotation onto the photon state. (This idea of teleporting operations is [not new](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908010), but the way we are using it here is.) This in effect allows you to manipulate the state of the photon without ever directly touching it.

By combining three of these rotation gates, you can build up an arbitrary single-qubit gate similarly to how you can use three rotations in real space to create an arbitrary 3D rotation using Euler angles. 

You can also create two-photon gates by scattering different photons sequentially against the atom. Arbitrary single-qubit gates plus two-photon gates like CZ comprise a universal gate set, so the device can implement arbitrary quantum circuits.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What types of problems is this design approach most useful fo? if any in particular.

The design is a considerable simplification over traditional scattering-based photonic designs, which need to use interactions between many quantum emitters (solid-state atoms) to process information. It is very difficult to get these emitters to behave indistinguishably, so it becomes exponentially harder to build large circuits as you increase the number of qubits and the circuit depth using more traditional designs. This design uses just one quantum emitter and a minimal number of controllable components (a coherently controlled atom, 3 switches, and a photon source). So in principle, it's easier to build.

It's also just a very different approach from what has been tried in photonics which is not constrained by a lot of the limitations of more traditional approaches (but introduces some new drawbacks of its own).",1611205652,QuantumComputing,bencbartlett,Quantum,Comment,311
898,"&gt;What's the idling error experienced by the photons propagating in the fiber during the execution time of a gate? If the fiber loss is 1db per kilometer, which takes about 5 microseconds to cross, then the loss over a second would be pretty bad.

Good question, take a look at Section III in the paper and Section VI of the supplementary materials. Specifically, we benchmark how the fidelity of operations on a single photonic qubit degrades with respect to cavity cooperativity and cycle loss (which accounts for ring size, attenuation, and insertion loss from the switches). Under optimistic but realistic values for cooperativity and bulk loss, you can get circuit depths of a few thousand operations with F&gt;50% fidelity. This analysis does not go super deeply into error propagation or correlated errors, but it does give a decent estimate for how robust to imperfection the design is.

The numbers you quote on fiber loss are also significantly far from state of the art, which is about 0.2 dB/km. The photon pulse size which determines the time bin size (and thus how many qubits can fit in the ring) is dependent on the cavity cooperativity, and the best experimentally demonstrated values could allow photon pulses of about 10m, or about 3ns time bins. This means that, as a back-of-the-napkin example, on a device supporting 100 photonic qubits, you could do 1000 operations in 300 microseconds.",1611204373,QuantumComputing,bencbartlett,Quantum,Comment,234

Although only having to ""control"" a single qubit sounds convenient, when the number of operations you can apply isn't scaling up with the number of qubits in the system (including qubits in storage), there is a maximum number of qubits you can't go beyond without being overwhelmed by idling errors on the stored qubits.

Three of these photon-atom interactions are required to understand what the interaction was in full? 

I'm assuming three photons (one for each measurement of the rotational axis) tells you something about the system as a whole and the information you've assigned within it? 

And this rotation tells you what about the information in the system?

906,"Photonics offers unique advantages as a substrate for quantum computing, but has fundamental scalability challenges. Nondeterministic schemes impose massive resource overheads, while deterministic schemes require integrating enormous amounts of identical quantum emitters into a photonic circuit. In this paper we propose an architecture for a photonic quantum computer which needs minimal quantum resources to implement any quantum circuit: a single coherently controlled atom

In our scheme, optical qubits are encoded as trains of single-photon pulses counter-propagating through a fiber storage ring. Optical switches can selectively scatter photons off of an atom-cavity system before returning them to the storage ring.  The atom is coherently controlled by a laser. After scattering a photon against the atom, a rotation is applied to the atomic qubit and the state is projectively measured in the ground state basis. This measurement teleports the rotation gate onto the photonic qubit. The teleported rotations are a universal quantum primitive: by composing 3 rotation gates with suitable angles, any single-qubit gate can be implemented through Euler angles. 

Two-photon gates such as CZ can also be implemented using a similar rotate-and-measure procedure. CZ and single-qubit gates are a universal gate set, so the device can implement any quantum circuit. Additionally, state readout can be done without using single-photon detectors by applying SWAP between each photon and the atom and sequentially measuring the atomic state. 

We also performed a detailed analysis of how our scheme performs in the presence of experimental imperfections. Assuming realistic parameters, error probability per gate is potentially fault tolerant at \~5×10⁻⁴, and very deep circuits are possible even without error correction.",1611174380,QuantumComputing,bencbartlett,Quantum,Comment,264

You might be able to exchange keys securely, but at the end of the day, it will be a classical computer processing those keys.

The argument, for instance, Bruce Schneier and, to an extent, NSA make is that QKD is solution to a problem that doesn't bother many people. There are hundreds of ways someone might eavesdrop or systems might fail rendering them insecure. So, using QKD will only add a tiny marginal value (if any) that doesn't make up for the cost of setting up the infrastructure (the more complex your infrastructure, the harder to keep it secure).

&gt;how many distinct ways may such a state be expressed as a tensor product among its three qubits? 

***If*** I can write the three-qubit state as a tensor product of three single-qubit states (which is not necessarily possible), i.e.

|φ&gt;\_ABC = |φ&gt;\_A  ⊗ |φ&gt;\_B ⊗ |φ&gt;\_C,

then there would be infinitely many such tensor products, because each of the three single-qubit states - |φ&gt;\_A, |φ&gt;\_B, and |φ&gt;\_C - can independently be in one of infinitely many single-qubit superposition states, i.e. anywhere on the Bloch sphere.  


&gt; Do I assume that the qubits in the generic state are entangled or unentangled? 

In general, you should not assume whether or not a generic multi-qubit state is entangled. If you can write a three-qubit state as a tensor product of three single-qubit states, as described earlier, then that state is unentangled, or, as it is more often described in quantum literature, *separable*. 

If a pure\*\* multi-qubit state *cannot* be written as a tensor product of single-qubit states, then it is entangled. Try writing this state, one of the ""Bell states,"" as a product of two single-qubit states:

|φ^(+)\&gt;\_AB = (|00&gt;\_AB + |11&gt;\_AB)/sqrt(2) = (|0&gt;\_A  ⊗ |0&gt;\_B + |1&gt;\_A  ⊗ |1&gt;\_B)/sqrt(2).

It can't be done, as this state is entangled. Fun fact: it is a *maximally* entangled state.

This state, on the other hand, can be separated:

|φ&gt;\_AB = (|00&gt;\_AB + |01&gt;\_AB + |10&gt;\_AB + |11&gt;\_AB)/2 = (|0&gt;\_A + |1&gt;\_A)/sqrt(2) ⊗ (|0&gt;\_B + |1&gt;\_B)/sqrt(2) = |φ&gt;\_A  ⊗ |φ&gt;\_B.

Hope this helps! 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* There's also *mixed* states (as opposed to pure states, which is all I addressed), but those can't be described by Hilbert space vectors; instead, you need a probabilistic *ensemble* of vectors, and you describe such a mixed state with a density matrix.

So, even though the external temperature is quite cold, you still need a lot of technology to reduce it down to 10 millikelvin. Many dilution refrigerators operate in 2 stages - a cryostat to get down to the temperature of liquid helium (~4.2K), and a dilution pump to get down to ~10 milliKelvin. Perhaps having everything in space would allow you to skip the first step, but we usually don't struggle greatly with the first step anyways! 

In addition, I think you would have a lot more pain with making sure that the rest of your support electronics work well in space, are radiation shielded, and are able to be replaced.",1610772042,QuantumComputing,seattlechunny,Quantum,Comment,159

1044,"\&gt;This wave function is what explains the position of the particle. We can make a measurement on that and find out the position. But then we come across another phenomenon called ""the uncertainty principle""...When we explain the properties of the sub-atomic particle which we use for states, ***we come across this uncertainty and we can only give a probability of which state it could be in***. So it turns out, we can actually use this uncertainty to our advantage. So, this idea of superposition comes up. ***Since we can give only a probability of what state it could be, it leaves us with a superposition of these two states*** with probabilities of different values. 

You're conflating the *uncertainty* of conjugate variables with measurement *probabilities*. They're related but not the same, and this isn't a correct description of superposition. The picture you started with is the wavefunction in position- and momentum-space, and you made a specious leap to discrete state space ""\[leaving\] us with a superposition of these two states."" Which *two* states could you be referring to if position and momentum are continuous? You're trying to make a link to a qubit space (because this is a quantum computing post), which is a discrete state space, from position- and momentum-space, which is continuous, but these are not the same thing.

Other ones are photos which you a photon gun to shoot onto a polarized film at the instant the photon decides whether to bounce off or filter through this is what gives it its superpositional state the photon is in both states before it hits the film.

I'm not really sure a Masters in QC is really a thing, though google tells me there are programs popping up. My experience is that QC is still a very research oriented field, so a PhD with research is usually necessary.

Overall, your ""major"" is not really important as much as what specific classes you take. To do QC, you'll want to take quantum mechanics, which will require some linear algebra and basic physics as background. Fortunately, you'll probably need those classes as a CS major too, so it wouldn't be hard to be a CS major with some classes in quantum mechanics.",1610321523,QuantumComputing,ticklecricket,Quantum,Comment,122

1116,"It's not just impossible right now, it's a fantasy. Using Grover's algorithm to mine bitcoin would require a universal quantum computer with ~256 logical qubits (i.e. tens to hundreds of thousands of physical qubits) and a hash rate which is competitively fast to classical computers. The best quantum computers in the world are light years away from this at the moment, both in number of qubits and error rates. A generous estimate for having this kind of application work would be late 2020s/early 2030s, and the resources certainly wouldn't be used for something dumb like mining bitcoin. 


In any case, this would also only provide a quadratic speed-up in mining, but the problem is embarrassingly parallel. So you're not just pitting a single quantum computer against a single classical one, you're pitting it against thousands of cheap CPUs designed specifically to run SHA-256 (you could parallelise the quantum computers, but this would be silly).",1610242167,QuantumComputing,CatchUpToTheSun,Quantum,Comment,154

1150,"There is some nuance to the answer and it depends a lot on what you mean by 'artificial intelligence', 'quantum computer', and 'advantages'

There will likely never be an application that runs entirely on a quantum computer using quantum ram in the near term, so all systems will have some procedures that accomplished on a quantum system and some on a classical. The field of quantum machine learning rapidly developing (I try to aggregate the latest whitepapers on /r/quantumml ) and is broken down across type of algorithm used and the type of data.

**Classical data/classical algorithm**: this is normal machine learning,

**Quantum data/Classical algorithm**: use machine learning to help understand and compile outputs from quantum systems([like this](https://interestingengineering.com/deep-learning-ai-has-officially-cracked-schrodingers-equation-says-study) )

**Classical Data/Quantum Algorithm** : this is what most people are talking about when they talk about quantum AI, using some form of quantum algorithm like the quantum fast fourier transform(runs in O(n\^2))  instead of classical FFT( runs in O(n2\^n) for amplitudes of 2\^n) to reduce the computational power needed for Convolutional Neural networks. The advantage comes in searching an entire vector space when modeling rather than linear processing. Huge speed up(maybe, in theory at least), but the catch is that the data is still stored in read from classical systems and takes time to prepare, needs large amounts of qubits, is noisy, etc etc etc so while this is the most exciting avenue and will be the most practical use cases, it is currently not a practical replacement to classical/classical [Example of using quantum on the mnist classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist)

**Quantum Data/ Quantum Algorithm**: the holy grail, more or less all data is stored from a quantum system and processed using a quantum algorithm. This would be the quantum advantage system if one exists near term. Frankly, no one is here at a scale that matters.

As a general hot take: This is an extremely new scientific field, anyone selling you anything quantum machine learning is incredibly likely to be a scam.

Of course physics also includes various forms of classical stuff, field theories (wait: those are important in QC), path integrals (nevermind: also important in QC)... I think you see where I am going.

1212,"&gt; Oh in that case I'm way more heretical than you. 

AFAICT, I'm not heretical at all. But my point-of-view is not widely held.

&gt; Totally. How do you design a machine that thinks together like that? Reality is distributed so it makes sense that computation has to happen everywhere without synchronization

Take a look at Vannevar Bush's Differential Analyser. Also, check out Neural ODE's and the paper ""Wave physics as an analog recurrent neural network"". I think this latter paper actually explains (without meaning to) *why* wave-particle duality occurs.
 
&gt; There seems to be a pretty core distinction that can be drawn. ""Quantum information"" like probability can't be *copied* - it can only be moved. In classical information, we can always ask the sender to repeat the message. In this way, the quantum world seems inherently *less* fault-tolerant.

When I (physically) erase a message that was written down on paper, where has that information gone? ""It's still there, in the scrambled bits of paper and rubber dust!"" But that's just a trite response. The point is this -- erasure of classical information is not absolute, it's relative to the ""message reader"" which, in the case of a human system, is the human mind. There is simply no conflict between classical and quantum information as demonstrated by the fact that I can *only* perceive the world classically despite the fact that the physical laws of the world are strictly quantum (not classical)!

&gt; One might even *define* classical information as ""that part of [quantum] information which can be copied""

Which is the empty set, because *no quantum information can be copied*. The QIT theorists are getting the cart before the horse -- no quantum information exists-as-such. The only information that ever exists is classical information. That is because we must first pass the ""quantum information"" through a measurement operator, which collapses the quantum state to a classical state. ""Oh but it was a quantum state before that!"" No, we *calculate* with quantum states because that makes the math easier. Only classical states can become direct objects of conscious awareness, therefore, only classical information exists, or even can exist.

&gt; Well, there we're at odds. Unitarity seems to suggest that unlike classical information theory, information is conserved and must *go* somewhere and *come from* somewhere. In the classical limit, if we send too much information too fast through a noisy channel, some of it is lost so we need to slow things down with redundancy. 

The loss of information is relative to the design (intent) of the system. Nothing is lost in any absolute sense. All conserved quantities remain conserved.

&gt; In the quantum world, (1) we can't copy information, so if we lose it en route, it's *gone* (2) lost information is still entangled with and affects the sender.

The same can be argued for classical information but I think it's a distinction without a difference. Information is information, it really doesn't matter whether you think of it classically or ""quantumly"" except that there are more ways you can operate on information encoded in quantum states than information encoded in classical states. Even there, I think that the real reason we make a distinction is only because we lack a theory that explains how these are just two different ways of looking at the same coin. No quantum operator can compress a classical string beyond the Shannon bound (or Kolmogorov complexity, if we're dealing with algorithmic information), therefore, no quantum operator provides any *advantage* in respect to information. Superdense coding and other quantum-specific treatments of information are only relevant to the quantum domain itself... once converted back to observables via measurement operator, it's just classical information again. ""But no classical system could have transmitted the information that efficiently."" So what? That's just another way of saying that quantum physics is not classical physics. It says nothing about the nature of information *itself*.",1609635298,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,652

1215,"&gt;I'm not pessimistic so much as I just don't buy into the hype regarding the current generation of QC. QC is already here, it will continue to grow, and it will find ""killer apps"" along the way. Eventually, it will become a major force within the market. I accept all of these tenets which are what is driving the current investment hype into QC. But the hype is overly-optimistic and the timing is wrong. Going from 1 to 50 qubits has taken around three decades, depending on how you count. Ordinarily, we expect to see super-linear speedup in technological development (e.g. silicon-based memory density). So if I'm pessimistic about anything, it's the timeline. We are chasing a diminishing return, here. The difficulty of scaling NISQ QC hardware is -- barring some unforeseen breakthrough -- super-linear. As we add more qubits, it becomes harder to add each additional qubit.

Oh in that case I'm way more heretical than you. I think the quantum advantage is polynomial at best and that we are missing some mathematical process to turn a quantum solution into a classical one.

Here's a thought experiment: Any deterministic function (including NP-hard) can be transformed into a program that takes linear time. All you have to do is evaluate that function on all its (exponentially many) inputs, store those I/O pairs, and replace the function with the lookup table. Similarly you could store the inverse function the same way. Now the question becomes ""why can't every problem be compiled out with this process?"", and I think the only answer is because it either consumes or emits too much information. NP-hard problems are the former, busy beaver problems are the latter.

&gt;Conventional digital computing. It is often overlooked that analog computation is ""natively parallel""... every part of an analog computer computes in parallel with all other parts. So, ""all the components think together"". I assert that this is more than a passing resemblance.

Totally. How do you design a machine that thinks together like that? Reality is distributed so it makes sense that computation has to happen everywhere without synchronization

&gt;We know that computation and physics are intimately linked, see Szilard's engine and reversible computing.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*shrug -- perhaps. I'm a computing-maximalist, so I frankly don't care about substrates. I just care about results.

Yeah it seems like even though information is implemented in nature, the Shannon limit is always there, mocking us. Switching to analog or accepting stochasticity don't change the fact that there is \*always\* an information bottleneck. I don't mean to say light and electricity are the best possible - they're just implementation details. Other problem domains admit other solutions (e.g. acoustic modems for the ocean).

&gt;Entanglement is the logical consequence of interaction. If two systems have interacted, they can no longer be treated as un-correlated. They are entangled. This can be treated purely abstractly (without reference to any physical system) and we can model it on a DAG.

YES. Now how do we implement that? How do you compile that DAG down to hardware? The natural thing to do, given a DAG, is to reason locally, by treating the nodes as stateful agents which pass messages along the edges.

&gt;In my view, that's the next big thing. We need to embrace approximation in computing. Obviously, there are certain things we do not want to be approximate. No one wants the bank to ""approximately"" calculate their checking account ledger! But I think it's safe to say that upwards of 90% of computing tasks are not like calculating an account ledger. If the rectangles defining the window borders on my 4k monitor are off by one pixel, do I really care? Most of the computation we are doing is needlessly exact. That is the root cause of much of the wasted energy of SOTA computing. See this image for illustration of my meaning. In ML workloads, we have already migrated from standard precision to reduced precision. The problem is that we require that 100% of our results are within the bounds defined by the precision (see image). If, instead, we allow noise in the system (that is, allow the signal to ""wander"" as long as it remains statistically normal), we can massively reduce power-consumption.

I do think the ""approximate"" ledger is okay. So long as the bank is either willing to lend me the difference or can make a better estimate on demand. That's why I love continued fraction arithmetic - it allows us to be exactly as lazy as the solution requires and to put sharp bounds our uncertainty. It also admits a composition structure which is a DAG on a tensor network:

&gt;FPGAs are widely used. They are just not widely used as special-purpose co-processors, like GPUs are.  
&gt;  
&gt;I agree, but I also think we need to ""leapfrog"" this model. It's not just a matter of leveraging parallelism, we need to relax the condition of exactness, for most computations.

Agreed - though I don't expect programmers to do error analysis on their programs or to necessarily rewrite their programs for GPU/FPGA. I expect a smart compiler to not create information which you throw away. And where it can't reason about that, to let you specify it in the type system.

&gt;It's about many things, first and foremost fidelity (faithfully reproducing a signal at a remote point in the presence of noise). This is why it is inherently connected to physics, because we can always trade code-space for signal power, and vice-versa.  
&gt;  
&gt;And this is why the language of thermodynamics is so similar to that of information.  
&gt;  
&gt;The similarity of thermodynamics to information theory arises from thought-experiment. We can imagine any kind of macroscopic observable (pressure, temperature, etc.) and we can imagine dividing this observable across unobserved ""microstates"" within the vessel we are thinking about. This automatically gives rise to an information theoretic measure because we get the same number of combinations, whether we are thinking about bits in a bit-stream or particle-occupancy of volumes within a gas.

There seems to be a pretty core distinction that can be drawn. ""Quantum information"" like probability can't be \*copied\* - it can only be moved. In classical information, we can always ask the sender to repeat the message. In this way, the quantum world seems inherently \*less\* fault-tolerant.

One might even \*define\* classical information as ""that part of \[quantum\] information which can be copied""

&gt;I disagree. QIT does not modify classical information theory, it only extends it.

In the classical limit, if we send too much information too fast through a noisy channel, some of it is lost so we need to slow things down with redundancy. In the quantum world, (1) we can't copy information, so if we lose it en route, it's \*gone\* (2) lost information is still entangled with and affects the sender.

&gt;There is no bright-line distinction between classical computation and quantum computation because the measurement operator is not a binary operator (""completely measure"" or ""completely don't measure""). Because you can measure to a degree, this creates a continuum between classical and quantum computation. I can build a quantum+classical computer where the classical computer partially measures the QC (to some advantage), and the resulting whole cannot be described as either completely classical or completely quantum. It is a blend of both.

Measurement does something interesting and seemingly non-local, even though it's not deterministic. We can certainly simulate randomness by mixing in noise. Can we simulate the non-locality ""enough"" to run Shor's algorithm? If so, why \*couldn't\* we just run it onto an FPGA in principle?

\*shrug -- perhaps. I'm a computing-maximalist, so I frankly don't care about substrates. I just care about results.

&gt; I agree that we need models of computation intermediate between classical and quantum. Stochastic computing has correlation but there’s another type of nonlocal conspiracy of bits called entanglement. The Fourier transform shows that clever bookkeeping can efficiently invert the locality structure of a space, and I have a nagging feeling that entanglement is just the vacuum information leaves behind when you move it instead of copying it.

Entanglement is the logical consequence of interaction. If two systems have interacted, they can no longer be treated as un-correlated. They are entangled. This can be treated purely abstractly (without reference to any physical system) and we can model it on a DAG.

&gt; I never really thought about the layout of computers as affecting the structure of computability. That seems like something that chip designers figure out and the programmer need not worry about (except for when that abstraction fails catastrophically, like Row Hammer). It seems very cool that letting go of determinacy could free up new hardware design options.

In my view, that's the next big thing. We need to embrace approximation in computing. Obviously, there are certain things we do *not* want to be approximate.

FPGAs are widely used. They are just not widely used as special-purpose co-processors, like GPUs are.

&gt; It would be so cool if next-gen compilers could bring these resources to the programmer (eg by detecting where parts of a program are better done on a coprocessor and offloading them the same way optimizing compilers use SIMD instructions today).

I agree, but I also think we need to ""leapfrog"" this model. It's not just a matter of leveraging parallelism, we need to relax the condition of exactness, for most computations.

&gt; It seems to me like classic information theory is all about how tightly we can pack information - either because we want it to be concentrated (compression) or diffuse (error detection/correction).

&gt; The promise of quantum computing is that we have a new way to think about information: how it flows. And because pure information is incompressible, need to get old information out of the way.

I disagree. QIT does not modify classical information theory, it only extends it.

&gt; The bridge between classical and quantum computing starts with an understanding of both. But even if you don’t believe the world splits in two when you measure an atom (I don’t). It seems like you have the exact same outlook as me: we don’t say the world splits when we flip a coin nor that one reality gets destroyed when you look at the coin. But that’s the core insight of Bayesianism: nondeterminism is mathematically identical to ignorance.

Or another way to say it -- all these ways of thinking are exactly equivalent. So choose whichever one you prefer, it doesn't really matter. What matters is that you use the right tools, and use them correctly, so that you can calculate correct answers. Otherwise, you will get lost.

&gt; But I do think there’s a bright line somewhere. Even if you have a computer with one core versus a computer with a million different parallel cores, they both have the same problems that can be solved in polynomial time. That polynomial bound seems robust under any finite (read: actual) computer. If we could show how, for e.g. integer factorization, the degree of parallelism corresponds with a decrease in time complexity, that would be something!

There is no bright-line distinction between classical computation and quantum computation because the measurement operator is not a binary operator (""completely measure"" or ""completely don't measure"").

The bridge between classical and quantum computing starts with an understanding of both. But even if you don’t believe the world splits in two when you measure an atom (I don’t). It seems like you have the exact same outlook as me: we don’t say the world splits when we flip a coin nor that one reality gets destroyed when you look at the coin. But that’s the core insight of Bayesianism: nondeterminism is mathematically identical to ignorance.

But I do think there’s a bright line somewhere. Even if you have a computer with one core versus a computer with a million different parallel cores, they both have the same problems that can be solved in polynomial time. That polynomial bound seems robust under any finite (read: actual) computer. If we could show how, for e.g. integer factorization, the degree of parallelism corresponds with a decrease in time complexity, *that* would be something!

I’d love to talk out-of-band with you about this. I want to hear how you would design a computer architecture if you had complete freedom. I might have some good ideas about how to program it!",1609619632,QuantumComputing,rotuami,Quantum,Comment,666

1223,"&gt; I know classical and quantum computing tend to be described in vastly different languages. What mental picture[s] do you use to think about quantum computing?

We live in a quantum universe. Therefore, every existing computer is a quantum computer. Think about it. It's an important point and frequently overlooked...

&gt; Complexity theory: classical computers are weaker, expressed as a containment relation on the set of problems they can solve in polynomial time P &lt;= PP &lt;= BQP (quantum computing) &lt;= PSPACE

No one has proved a strict containment. We don't know if QC is actually capable of computing higher complexity classes than classical computers (given the same set of theoretical resources).

&gt; Operational: classical computers operate on a state. quantum computers operate on a complex vector of states.

A classical computer simulates any quantum computer. They are logically equivalent.

&gt; Philosophical: The universe solves problems that are inherently hard.

Define hard. It is certainly the case that no one has demonstrated that the universe solves uncomputable problems (and, since checking such solutions is itself an uncomputable problem, there seems to be no way to even demonstrate such a thing). ""Hard"" in the theory of computability is *waaaaay* harder than most people realize. Get back to me after you've calculated the 10th busy-beaver number...

&gt; Since reality is quantum, we can use that as an oracle machine to solve our hard problems. Classical computers just ignore that resource.

This would be wonderful, but we have to balance the relative economic costs involved. Is it actually cheaper to operate Sycamore than a SOTA silicon-based super-computer? Innovations in machine-learning and stochastic computation are increasing the compute-horizon of classical computers by orders of magnitude even as QC is attempting to achieve ""quantum supremacy""... is quantum supremacy really chasing the end of the rainbow?

&gt; Geometric: Quantum computers do something geometrical, via isometries and projections on tensor space. Classical computers operate on only points instead of the whole space.

I would challenge the bright-line distinction you are making between classical and quantum computers. Is an optical computer classical or quantum? Well, it depends on how you operate it. You can set up quantum effects in an optical computer, or you can just use it to perform classical computations in parallel. I disagree with the implication that ""classical"" is synonymous with ""serial"". The macroscopically observable world around us is massively-parallel *and* classical. Imagine how much computation is being performed by a single ocean wave crashing against the rocks (as measured by the amount of computation -- classical or quantum -- required to simulate it).

&gt; Shut up and calculate: Quantum computers are computing with complex numbers. Classical computing is insisting the numbers be real.

Analog computers can handle complex quantities natively (encoded in phase shift). So, there's that...",1609545372,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,463

1271,"Yep. My view on quantum computing is an extension of a geometrical view of classical information. To really internalize a model of computation that includes probability, I feel it's necessary to understand how it intersects exactly with the classical model. I'd be much more charitable if there were some good way to reason about how a classical distribution model ""embeds"" in the Bloch picture.

I think tensors are the correct language for computing and that and everything else is built on top of that, even in classical computing. My journey started differently though also in a classical picture. I stumbled across Bill Gosper's continued fraction arithmetic [https://perl.plover.com/yak/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt](https://perl.plover.com/yak/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt) which demonstrated how all real arithmetic is secretly linear algebra in disguise. If you leave fractions as formal vectors in the plane instead of ""collapsing them"" to the rational numbers, the result is a very handy computational gadget. There's a very clever message passing model in there to do computation incrementally. And you can add ""loops"" (i.e. partial traces) to encode Newton iteration.

There is a \*really\* nice way that Mobius functions embed distributions. Under z -&gt; (az+b)/(cz+d), both split-complex and complex numbers transform just like the distributions they parameterize:

1. You have the \*hard-edged intervals\* x+yj \~= (x +/- y) where the interval is \*inside\* if y&lt;=0 and \*outside\* if y=&gt;0. (taking j\*j=1). In this view, the sign of the matrix's determinant says whether it inverts an interval.
2. You have the \*Cauchy distributions\* x+yi \~= (x +/- y). This can be seen as that point on the complex plane emitting light evenly in all directions to light up the x-axis.

Information theory is cool and I'm sure I will dive into it very deeply. The Fisher Information Metric looks suspiciously like convolution of the log-probability; in which case it seems easier to picture it as a vector over some basis distributions. But admittedly I haven't played around with it!

As for Bayes theory, again I think that \*that\* is also a nonlinear distortion of a fundamentally linear theory and that the gradient is a merely local approximation to a deeper structure. Local Bayesian methods are nice, but not nearly as nice as a nice set of basis functions that form an inner product space! (then again I'm very, very biased toward the discrete case, which doesn't have the same flavor as inference on continuous parameters)

My favorite math YouTuber, 3Blue1Brown just did a video on this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko) The punchline is if you use the odds ratio (an array) instead of the probability (its projection onto the standard number line), it's so much easier to reason probabilistically since things have that sweet, sweet linearity that I just can't get enough of!",1609374998,QuantumComputing,rotuami,Quantum,Comment,449

BTW, I do think the way that I really came to appreciate CP\^N is not far from the aspects you find most revealing; specifically, I spent some time thinking about metrics over \*classical\* probability distributions which allow the same type of picture. In other words, let's say we have a classical distribution over discrete elements (the new ""zoom-in""). We can ask the same question: is there a representation where each \*distribution\* is summarized as a point which characterizes the \*closeness\* of one distribution to another. This is what information geometry is all about:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher\_information\_metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric)

And we care about this a lot in eg Bayesian statistical learning -- if we supply a parameterized likelihood function and hope to collect data to optimize this function, we wish to understand how distinguishable neighboring distributions are locally in order to characterize how efficiently we can optimize. For example, if we are searching for a Gaussian distribution to fit data in some online fashion, we should perturb the mean and covariance parameters more slowly when our belief indicates a larger variance. Intuitively, it takes more samples to pinpoint a wider Gaussian because its neighbors are statistically closer. Consider a delta function: we need just one sample to localize this minimum-variance distribution -- there is no confusability with its neighbors. The idea of ""distinguishability"" and ""discrimination"" is far from being a quantum idea!

When reasoning about probabilistic state vectors, there’s a really nice picture: basis states sit naturally on perpendicular axes at unit distance and the state space is the polytope which is their convex hull. The zero point at the origin is where the pbit doesn’t even exist. It seems to me that an intuitive visualization of the qubit should contain this geometrical picture as a natural cross-section.

I do mean the exterior power because it captures the meaning of “shape and size” in tensor space. The exterior algebra is the part of tensor space that behaves nicely under length-preserving transformations.",1609312470,QuantumComputing,rotuami,Quantum,Comment,163
1290,"wow. A lot to digest and i’m truly at the edge of my understanding here.

1) yes. all models are wrong. some models are useful.
3) the determinant is not a whole picture! the determinant arises as the volume of an element of the exterior algebra - but these elements have *shape* too (which is described by the eigenbasis). Since unitarity preserves length, unitary transformations are exactly isomorphisms of the exterior algebra.

I clearly have much to learn and I regret not having access to a physics program in college. c’est la vie. Maybe one day I’ll go to grad school!",1609309415,QuantumComputing,rotuami,Quantum,Comment,101
1291,"And I think you may also have a misguided belief that the Bloch sphere, or any CP^N, has a non-linear structure only because of quotients. This is also not true.

1292,"Btw I feel that you are against geometric pictures of quantum states largely because you feel it is less connected with the classical world. In particular, you have called out a few times that you prefer thinking about distributions over basis states and tensor products of basis states (no need to mention exterior powers, you just mean tensor products in the standard language).

The whole point of the information geometric picture is to describe the “closeness” of one such distribution to another in terms of possible measurement statistics. We do this all of the time in the classical statistics world too, so this is not an inherently quantum goal: you may find some inspiration by taking a look at the Fisher-Rao geometric picture which is entirely classical",1609299817,QuantumComputing,farice,Quantum,Comment,127
1294,"Many comments:

1) The physical state space of course differs, in general, from the abstracted state space. This is true in essentially any standard architecture: superconducting, optical, ion-trapped. We are assuming in our discussion that our computation takes place within the abstraction of qubits. This is obviously an assumption, and folks do argue for using qutrits or other abstractions for specific architectural reasons. This feels irrelevant to our previous discussion because the moment we choose our abstraction, we do have to care about the implied geometry in many cases. A great example is the Natural Gradient paper.

2) a Riemannian metric is in fact just a local inner product. The same Dirac inner product which you like is used to describe this metric locally. This metric turns out to have a global structure for this reason: the fubini-study metric is just the arccos of the overlap

3) your understanding regarding metrics is further incorrect given your comment regarding volume. The metric tensor indeed describes “shape” in terms of the local coordinates. The volume form arises by taking a determinant

4) my recommendation to you is to take a look at the General Linear group in some depth. This Lie Group describes a structure over invertible linear maps which are obviously linearly related, despite the metric not being linear. The structure of the Bloch Sphere is not really obfuscating the fact that each element can be thought of as a unitary gate relative to an arbitrary pure state (which is obviously linear), but rather describes a sense in which the images are related (in terms of inner products)

5) you are not proposing a separate abstraction, just a subset. It’s like having a vector space and focusing on the monoidal structure within. We get a lot of freebies by acknowledging the complete structure. The issue is not quotients, you can study U(N) alone as a Lie Group and never encounter a quotient while learning plenty about quantum gates",1609299281,QuantumComputing,farice,Quantum,Comment,327
1295,"The ""may or may not"" part has to do with implementation details and I stand by it. If your qubit is spin up or spin down, the physical picture coincides with the Bloch sphere. But if your qubit is polarization of light, there are two geometries at play - one of physical geometry and of quantum information geometry.

Yes, the Bloch sphere is a metric space, which is a stronger structure than its topology alone. That structure has complementary descriptions in terms of either a metric (the distance between two points) or as an inner product (the closeness between two points). I find the latter much more intuitive! (this might be because Dirac notation has really spoiled me in making inner products feel so natural)

The distance view does have its benefits - but it leaves a \*lot\* out; namely it just represents the \*volume\* of a multivector, not its shape. (That volume is useful; not least because it's invariant under unitary transformation)

Also, the ""differentiable manifold"" part seems to be nearsighted (pun intended) because taking the quotient early distorts the space. Quantum operations are not \*merely\* differentiable (i.e. approximately linear at every point) they are \*actually linear\* on tensor space!

There is typically additional structure beyond an ordinary graded algebra (every abstraction sweeps \*something\* under the rug). The grades are simply a way to carve up the tensor space basis so your total state is a distribution over that graded algebra. It's also a nice way of seeing classical computing as embedded in quantum computing - classical computing on n bits is simply trying to compute where each step starts and ends in a pure state of the n'th exterior power (or &lt;=n'th exterior power if you allow bits to be ""uninitialized"").",1609288149,QuantumComputing,rotuami,Quantum,Comment,293

Hence, the Bloch sphere is just a representation of \*one\* complex number, in some sense. Let's forget about qubits, and recall the Riemann sphere:

By not specifying identity gates the compiler has fewer constraints placed on it and may choose to schedule the operations as it sees fit. For example, a system may choose to do something more intelligent like dynamical decoupling to improve performance behind the scenes that may be dependent on the programmers choice.

If you desire knowing exactly what gate is done at what time (a schedule) I would recommend including identities (presuming the compiler won't choose to remove these operations as they are identity).",1609082033,QuantumComputing,whitewhim,Quantum,Comment,109

Starting with the state vector you gave, write the complex numbers in polar form: 

 \[0.85355339+0.14644661i, 0.00000000+0.50000000i\]  = \[ 0.8660254033 \* e\^(i \*  0.169918456), 0.5 \* e\^(i \* pi/2) \]

Factor out an overall phase of e\^(i \*  0.169918456) leaving us with equivalent state vector 

\[ 0.8660254033 \* e\^(i \*  0.169918456), 0.5 \* e\^(i \* pi/2) \] = e\^(i \*  0.169918456) \[ 0.8660254033, 0.5 \* e\^(i \* 1.40087787079) \]

1397,"Hello those are some great first questions! The first comment is pretty straightforward but here is some extra knowledge that might help answers some questions. A qubit or a quantum bit can be anything from atoms, ions, photon or electrons which work with respective devices to manipulate them and read them. I will be using an example of an electron that spins around a phosphorus atom. This is in reference to Andrea Morello as that is the system they use. The electron has a certain magnetic field that it creates and with this megnetic field they can manipulate it with microwave beams to position its magnetic poles the way they want. This is refered to as the electron spin and where the northern pole of the field is call 0 and the southern point 1. 

Alright now these position are referenced to binary code so a qubit with a 0 on the northern side and a 1 on the southern side gets written as |1&gt; and if the qubit is turned upside down its becomes |0&gt; amd vice versa, this text is called a linear combination and this is how qubits get written in code. So if there is a 2 qubit system then another ""bit"" is added |00&gt; 

A little explanation an Lets write a numbet 4, 
for a 4 we need a 3 qubit system and is written
 |4&gt; = |100&gt; = (01) x (10) x (10)
""imagine this being written verticaly like the example below""
1 = 0 0 = 1 that way its easier to visualize the qubit 
      1        0
A 4 means that we will find a 1 in the 4th position of a 8 bit code since qubit grow exponentially 2^3 = 8 
00001000 &lt;- 4th position = |100&gt; 
01234567 &lt;- number of bit positions 8

Now this is where all the fun comes in of quantum mechanics, we can beam the electrons to put them in a entangled state which kinda sets them sideways so there is a 50% chance they are 1 or 0 up or down we do this by sending them through a ""gate"" called Hadamards Gate and there is a whole lot of math and matrices that happen but then they go into a state called a black box and this is where your typical functions happen such as contant 1 constant 0, negation, and identity. We call these the Deutch oracle operations. 

Since like you stated quantum computers NEED to be reversible we have to change some stuff about our black box which needs 2 input bits and 2 output bits. But the input bit ALWAYS stays the same we just manipulate the output bit using those operations and this is because of the no cloning rule. 

So this means the qubits never interact with a gate the gate only interacts with qubits and we use something called the unit circle state machine to manipulate the bits. There is 1 qubit dedicated to controlling another qubit and the funtion happens in those black boxes which contain 1 of the operations. Now we can combine multiple of these to create your and, not, and or gates like normal computers. This is why quantum computers will never really be in homes they have unique properties that allow to be in all these states at once until we observe it and until we do we dont know what happens in the Black box but we can reverse the operation once we do read the output. This allows for only certain types of operations to be very efficient like factoring or data base searching. 

Now in reference to if its programmable, we can manipulate the  qubits to have a certain type of outcome but we do that in the black box using multiple processes of the Hadamards gate and direct manipulation. 

Gates are not ""recyclable"" but we can create the conditions of a gate using the microwaves to shoot the qubit into a probability state/function that we want and test the outcome to see if it is the one we want, and well 
There is noise and a plethora of other conditions that can ruin an answer but hopefully this is good information.

1421,"**tl;dr**

The probabilities will be the same in the two scenarios you describe (math below), and that's what you really care about. Of course, if you measure in the X basis directly, you're going to end up with an X basis eigenstate. Similarly, if you measure in the Z basis directly, you're going to end up with a Z basis eigenstate, but often we only care about probabilities of outcomes. We don't care so much about the state they end up in, but the states after the measurement are absolutely different in the two scenarios you describe, and that may be what you're getting stuck on (please correct me if I'm wrong). 

**long version**

If you have a copy of Nielsen &amp; Chuang handy, check out Section 2.2.3 on quantum measurement.

In the standard computational (Z) basis, i.e. {|0&gt;, |1&gt;}, the two measurement operators are M\_0=|0&gt;&lt;0| and M\_1=|1&gt;&lt;1|. In the X basis, {|+&gt;, |-&gt;}, the two measurement operators are M\_+=|+&gt;&lt;+| and M\_-=|-&gt;&lt;-|. Let's say we have a single-qubit state, |Ψ&gt;.

Scenario 1: We measure |Ψ&gt; in the X basis using measurement operators M\_+=|+&gt;&lt;+| and M\_-=|-&gt;&lt;-|, both of which are their own complex conjugate transpose (dagger). The probability of measuring the |+&gt; state is given by

p(+) = &lt;Ψ|(M\_+^(+))M\_+|Ψ&gt;

= &lt;Ψ|+&gt;&lt;+|+&gt;&lt;+|Ψ&gt;

= &lt;Ψ|+&gt;&lt;+|Ψ&gt;

The state after such a measurement is

|Ψ'&gt; = |+&gt;&lt;+|Ψ&gt;/sqrt(p(+))

The results for the |-&gt; state follow identically. 

Scenario 2: We first apply a Hadamard to |Ψ&gt;, giving us the state H|Ψ&gt;, and then measure in the Z basis with the M\_0=|0&gt;&lt;0| and M\_1=|1&gt;&lt;1| operators. The probability of measuring in the |0&gt; state is given by

p(0) = &lt;Ψ|H^(+)(M\_0^(+))(M\_0)H|Ψ&gt;

= &lt;Ψ|H^(+)|0&gt;&lt;0||0&gt;&lt;0|H|Ψ&gt;

= &lt;Ψ|H^(+)|0&gt;&lt;0|H|Ψ&gt;

= &lt;Ψ|+&gt;&lt;+|Ψ&gt;        // = p(+) from Scenario 1!

Since we measured in the X basis, we're left with

|Ψ'&gt; = |0&gt;&lt;0|H|Ψ&gt;/sqrt(p(0))

= |0&gt;&lt;+|Ψ&gt;/sqrt(p(0))       // same probability amplitude from Scenario 1, but along a different axis! 

so the only difference from scenario 1 is that the state after measurement is in a different basis (which we fully expected), but the ***probabilities***, which are often what we care about most in the context of quantum computing are the same in each scenario. In this way, measuring a qubit in the X basis is the same as first applying a Hadamard gate to a qubit and then measuring in the Z basis.",1608830444,QuantumComputing,lemniscateoo,Quantum,Comment,384

This method doesn't involve anything related to using polarisation unlike what the article mentions. On the other hand, the article has the basic idea for using entangled photons, with a polarising beam splitter and single photon detectors correct, however their not generating entangled photons nor are the detectors single-photon detectors.

As the experiment is presented, you are correct, its just measuring electronic noise. In proper experiments whilst you will always measure the electronic noise when measuring any quantum system, that electronic noise or 'classical noise' is carefully characterised, it will effectively set an upper bound on how much actual quantum randomness you can extract from measured signal. However in this experiment, they are not measuring single photons.

In classical computing, we have bits and bytes, memory, and fundamental operations such as AND, OR, NOT, etc. From these we can derive higher-order operations like addition, subtraction, compare, branch, and so forth. This is a model of computation (and, by the way, not the only one in existence), not tied to any particular hardware. Once we have the model specified, only then do we design hardware to implement the model.

That's what I initially had a hard time understanding about QC: we do not design the hardware first, then come up with a model that explains the behavior. In order to have a working, programmable, reliable quantum computer, you must design a model first, *then* build the hardware that works like the model.

Remember that quantum doesn’t replace classical computing. It’s more like an accelerator of a key step. 

For example, if QC is used to crack RSA encryption using Shor’s algorithm, Shor’s teases out periodicity in a function of a target large pseudo prime. That’s a one task in the many required in decrypting data this way, but of course it’s an essential step. 

The hardware folks involved will see their work reused in other fields and problems and algorithms. 

Meanwhile, the software guys dealing with QC and Shor?  They have additional work to do, after they get their periodicity result, before they have decrypted data. 

It’s also worth noting that the software guys (hey, gals too, ofc) are going to need skills in crypto and math, not just QC.

1491,"I want to add more thing based on how you framed your question, which in itself seems to hint at some misconceptions.    

In entanglement, one of the photons does not “control” the other photon, they are just correlated in their outcomes.   This is essential to understand so as to not fall into the fallacy that quantum communication allows “faster than the speed of light” communications.   Entanglement only says that two or more quantum states are correlated in their outcomes.   For example, If photon 1 and 2 has the entangled degrees of freedom x1 and x2, then an entangled state could look like a superposition of |x1= 0, x2=0&gt; and |x1=1,x2=1&gt;.  For this if you measure x1, the outcome x1=0 will tell you that x2=0 and visa versa.   The outcomes are correlated but you can’t use one of the states to “control” the other.   It is only their outcomes that are correlated.   If you flip x1 from 0 to 1, that doesn’t mean x2 will flip from 0 to 1.   

Also, from a physical perspective, photons are usually used for quantum communication but up until recently photonic quantum computers were not considered to be an optimal platform.   The best current quantum computers either use superconducting qubits or ion trap qubits.   You may have read about the new quantum supremacy experiment using photonic quantum computing.   However I think it is still fair to say that superconduxtjng or ion trap are still the best quantum computer platforms as they can be programmed to do different operations.   If integrated photonics can mature enough to have programmable operations than this may change, but for now photonic quantum computers can only be engineered effectively to perform a single task (in the case of the Gaussian boson sampling experiment that achieved quantum supremacy).   

However, it is pretty well established that quantum communications will use photons, at least over long distances as we can use fiber optics or satellite communication technology to communicate over long distance with lower loss.   It may be possible tho that quantum processors could be linked via other forms of quantum communications or interfacing between quantum processors that are separated by shorter distances.",1608663126,QuantumComputing,vacuum_state,Quantum,Comment,359

Anyone who doesn’t know this prior knowledge would get very different measurement results since they don’t know the correct basis to measure on. If you want to learn more the bell state measurement is a good thing to look up. 
Entanglement is also used for distributed quantum computing or the quantum internet as some people like to call it. Let’s say I have a bunch of photons that are all entangled somehow. I can send you some of the photons and maintain the entanglement. I can perform operations on the photons I have and you can perform operations on the ones you have. Our states are in different physical locations but we both are doing computation on the system. Kinda like a multi core processor",1608656404,QuantumComputing,Smallz1107,Quantum,Comment,191
1499,"Quantum entanglement is a very strong correlation between the quantum states of more than one systems. In a quantum computer, these systems are the qubits.

From an algorithmic perspective, entanglement is something that you can intentionally exploit to get the desired behavior in a quantum computer. In the algorithms that I've studied so far, the most ubiquitous use of entanglement is to correlate the state of an input register of with the corresponding output states for the problem that the algorithm is solving. That gives you a superposition state which if measured, gives you an input/output pair for the problem you're solving. Of course that isn't enough to make a quantum algorithm, the actual hard part is to figure out how to increase the probability of measuring certain desired input/output pairs.

Another example for where entanglement is used is in error correction. The goal is to get multiple physical qubits to act like one ""logical"" qubit. To achieve this, you need to entangle the physical qubit states in a way that errors on the physical qubits can be measured and undone without destroying information of the logical qubit state. Error correction is something that is required for practical quantum computing and so that large computations can be done without worrying about the noise in the system.",1608656126,QuantumComputing,KnightShuffler,Quantum,Comment,216

1501,"This is not the answer.  Quantum encryption is done over two classical computers, the only thing quantum is during transmission or the quantum info, and even this doesn’t fundamentally require entanglement.   The two main protocols that require entanglement are quantum teleportation and superdense coding.   Quantum teleportation could be used to link quantum computers (although this is far, far off from being a technological reality).   Quantum computing as far as I know is arguable whether it needs entanglement at all.   The main quantum phenomena used in quantum computing is superposition and the wave nature of qubits.   The computation runs as a superposition of bit representations, where through logic gates the states constructively or destructively interfere with each other.   What results, for the cases in which this is advantageous, is that the correct solution to the problem interferes constructively while the wrong solution interferes destructively.  Thus the correct answer is more likely to be measured at the end of the computation.  I’m more familiar with quantum communication so if anyone knows whether entanglement is more central to quantum computing than I am framing it then chime in.",1608654170,QuantumComputing,vacuum_state,Quantum,Comment,185

I completely agree.  In fact, watch the Ben Franklin video.  I show experimental evidence that Physics describes capacitors incorrectly.

Nope, expanding/shrinking space/time is incorrect, where Doppler Effect is much MORE correct.

&gt; The Schrodinger equation also models experimental results correctly. 

Yes.  But the Born Rule interpretation leads to the ideas of Quantum State Superposition, where Schrodinger's Equation is modelling WAVE superposition of Ether medium.  The Born Rule also creates the EPR paradox, which better exposes the ""Measurement Problem"" of current QM ""wavefunction collapse"" and EPR also invalidates the Uncertainty Principle of Indeterminism.

Born rule experimental results are approximations and not to be interrelated as nature.  If you interpret them as natural phenomena, then we get weird ideas like Quantum Computing.

The Born Rule creates the IDEA of Quantum State Superposition and there is no scientific evidence or proof that the Born Rule has anything to do with nature.  It is just one man's opinion.

1621,"&gt;	 saying that there are no problems quantum computers can do that classical computers cannot is wrong right?

This *seems* to be the case but cannot be claimed with absolute confidence.

The significance of Shor’s algorithm is that it proves “factoring integers takes only polynomial time if you have a quantum computer.” Factoring is assumed to be hard; this assumption is so strong we build encryption systems that would be useless if the assumption failed.

It’s tempting to say that “factoring is not in P” (i.e. can’t be done in polynomial time on a classical computer) but it’s not conclusively proven. Such a proof would imply that P!=BQP and also P!=NP, the biggest unresolved question in computer science. (The opposite is not true - a clever polynomial time classical factoring algorithm would not prove P=NP nor that P=BQP.)

If one walks down to the corner store to get some milk or something they can be walking, breathing, chewing gum, and singing along to music all at the same time. Each of these is an independent task so you could say we are capable of multitasking. (Answer = 1)

 However, these are lower level activities that require less brain power and when people think of the term they are usually referring to higher level tasks.

The first option will fragment each task and alternate between then in an efficient and orderly fashion. The second option works well with 2 tasks by simplifying one of them so that it becomes a lesser level task that can then be automated while concentrating on the higher level task. 

There is also a hybrid option possible that would incorporate both multiplexing and simplified automation.

1635,"**In quantum mechanics what you ""measure"" are the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator.** 

&amp;#x200B;

In quantum computing (QC) that operator is the Pauli-z, which has an eigenspectrum of {1,-1}. Those two eigenvalues are associated with the eigenvectors, up and down (or |0&gt; and |1&gt;). This why you often see the Pauli-z as a 2x2 matrix with1 and -1 on the diagonal. It has been represented in its eigenbasis, which is (for any operator) the basis that a yields a diagonal representation.  This is also why you often see Pauli-X and Pauli-Y represented as 2x2 matrices that are NOT diagonal. They are represented in the in z-basis, and since x, y, and z do not commute that do not share and eigenbasis and cannot be simultaneously diagonalized.  


Example:  
You have 1 qubit in the |0&gt; state. If you ""measure it""---i.e., collapse it to any of its possible pauli-z states--- you will only very measure a 1, since this is the eigenvalue we associate with the |0&gt; state. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now is you apply the X operator to your state, you will ""flip"" the bit.

X|0&gt; = |1&gt;

Then if you measure you new |0&gt; state, you will measure -1.      


Lastly, if you apply a Hadamard gate you will create a superposition. 

H|0&gt; = |0&gt; + |1&gt;  (ignoring normalization)   
If you measure this, you will either get a -1 or a 1,and if you measure many times, you will find that you -1 around 50% of the time and 1 the other 50%. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should be noted about the last example is that the Hadamard gate takes a z-basis state and turns it unto an x-state. What does that mean? If you represent the Pauli-X operator in the basis H|0&gt; and H|1&gt;, it will be diagonal---i.e., those are the eigenstates of the Pauli-X. However, no quantum computer I know of measure X at the end. They are setup only top measure Z, and to measure X you apply an H gate.   


Tl;dr  
What you measure are eigenstate of a Hermitian operator.

There is a VERY important distinction between an operator and the matrix representation. 

In its eigenbasis representation, an operator is diagonal.

Another major application of QC is quantum simulations. Here is an excerpt from an [IBM talk on quantum computing](https://tatourian.blog/2018/09/07/quantum-computing-its-principles-capabilities-and-challenges/).

""Caffeine has 95 electrons. To simulate a single energy state of one caffeine molecule we would require 10^48 classical computer bits. Number of atoms in our planet is estimated to be to be somewhere between 10^49 and 10^50 so we would need as much memory as between 1 and 10 percent of the Earth’s mass. We could actually represent this using 160 qubits. 160 because log to the base 2 of 10 to the 48 is 160. 160 qubits represent 10^48 classic bits. That’s the theory.""

Now imagine the amount of classical compute power required to simulate proteins with 2000+ amino acids to the highest degree of precision, and it becomes clear why quantum computing is hugely advantageous for this particular workload.

my theory as to what's going on with all these startups is the primary value of quantum today is: marketing.  The mega companies have quantum efforts because in reality the entire quantum budget is a rounding error to them, and in fact the cool press about it keeps them relevant and hip, which helps further their image of being a bleeding edge company.  Startups are getting businesses from massive finance and bio-pharma companies to play with quantum because, again, the millions they are paying these startups is nothing to these companies.  Investing fractions of a penny into a new field that may be game changing, is a worthy ROI.  But mostly, these giant companies can put out press ads that they are doing quantum computing, so that they look cool and keep up a brand, which has real ROI today.  So, in summary, the business and value proposition of quantum computing today is simply: branding.

Of course, the reality that most sane scientists such as yourself (and I as well) know, is that quantum is insanely far away from being useful, with an average technical ROI of $0.  But, we're not looking at the broader picture, that branding has real value and does impact profits. 

Whether or not this is ethical is up to each person, but it's also not the the only time companies invest in things with no value and just use it as marketing.  One example is the Microsoft stores.  They lose money like crazy on that, but keep it up so that they don't lose branding to Apple.

1664,"&gt;I’m going to assume your answer to my questions was “yes it’s higher level” to all. 

Then you really should take the time to read the definition.


&gt;&gt;	Would you consider a calculator that only performs addition and subtraction not helpful for arithmetic because it only did basic operations?

&gt;Yes

So when I'm doing my taxes and using a calculator to add up receipts, the calculator isn't helping me? Because I would say that adding up 100s of terms is a lot of help.


&gt;The gates that most people design their algorithms with (CNOT and single qubit gates) *are* the hardware instruction set for superconducting Qubits.

Again, gates are different from instructions:

&gt;&gt;A quantum algorithm consists of a sequence of operations and measurements applied to a quantum processor. To date, **the instruction set** which defines this sequence **has been provided by a classical computer and passed via control hardware to the quantum processor**.

https://www.swissquantumhub.com/quantum-instruction-set-implemented-on-a-superconducting-quantum-processor/


&gt;Weird how knowledge about a programming language also comes on a spectrum.  I’ve taken a class on verilog once, but I’ve been working with python and qiskit for years.

&gt;Which example?  They all look like they get run at compile time to me.  A verilog “loop” at runtime would involve a register and a clock.

I've done more than just a class. 


&gt;If you type “a+b” in your qiskit code, you are doing *classical* addition in python, and nothing gets run on your quantum computer.

And I can write classical loops as well in qiskit. Did you not know that?


&gt;When you are working with something higher-level than assembly, you can have variables where you don’t even need to worry about where they get stored - it’s handled for you.  In languages like Python, you don’t even have the option of choosing where the variables are stored.

A variable index is different than its memory location... this is like programming 101..


&gt;That’s in the hardware instruction set for both ions and superconducting qubits.

So you admit they're different, yet the qiskit code you wrote for either is the same?

&gt;There is literally no currently existing way to program a quantum computer except by arranging quantum logic gates.

Weird how you just agreed that someone can make their own gate.

&gt;As for multi-qubit gates, not that much.

Either it exists or it doesn't.

&gt;Qiskit does include a practical 2-qubit synthesis tool, and a mostly impractical 3-4 qubit synthesis tool. 

So it does exist.


&gt;Writing a quantum program as a unitary gate is like writing a classical program as a truth table.

&gt;I’m not sure where that would place it relative to classical analogs, since I have never written classical programs in terms of truth tables, so I do not know of tools to do so.

People that actually use HDL **do** use a truth tables to program stuff. Get it figured out in LogicAid then transfer the code to SimUAid. In Qiskit they offer all those tools in a Jupyter notebook.

Almost like qiskit is easier to use than VHDL/Verilog. Weird how that works, isn't it.",1608079282,QuantumComputing,Dlrlcktd,Quantum,Comment,509

Never the less, I have 10,000 shares, and I am hoping for the best and am cautiously optimistic. It's money I can afford to lose.

Anyways, you might find this interesting. I asked on the Quantum Computing Stack Exchange the potential to build a carbon-based QC (linking the Archer CEO's paper) and I got this answer:

https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12293/how-promising-is-the-possibility-of-carbon-based-qubits-to-make-a-qubit-that-s-s/12317#12317

This person's second opinion seems to agree with your assessment.

&gt;In my opinion this is not a very promising qubit for quantum computing, though it may hold more promise for quantum sensing or communication.

&gt;Making a qubit, a two-level quantum system, is not that hard, but making a good qubit is very hard. David DiVincenzo laid out 5 criteria on which you could gauge how good a qubit is for quantum computing. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiVincenzo%27s_criteria Going through those criteria it becomes obvious where the system demonstrated in the first paper falls short.

&gt;First what they did right, they developed and characterized a new spin qubit and demonstrated that they can manipulate it with microwaves in a magnetic field. (Somewhat fulllfilling criteria 1 and 4)

&gt;They also demonstrated long, for this type of system, coherence times (175 ns). However, if you consider their minimum gate times, about 16 ns, those coherence times really aren't that long. And just as an example other organic radicals (which could be considered qubits) can exceed 10 us at room temperature. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b03027

&gt;Next the biggest problem comes from scaling the systems, both down to the single qubit level(criteria 5) and to multi-qubit systems (criteria 1 and 3).

&gt;They were working with ensembles of qubits, I'd you want to use those qubits in a fashion similar to topological QC's, you ideally need to work with single qubits. Single spin magnetic resonance is very hard and there are really only two solutions: a superconducting microwave resonator, which commonly require low temperature; or optical detection, which require very specific photophysical processes in order to read out the spinstate. Nitrogen vacancy centers are a good example of a spin system with optical detection.

&gt;That said, there are proposal about how to perform ensemble quantum computing, where you basically get your statistics out in one shot which would render that point moor.

&gt;Scaling up to multi-qubit devices also poses a challenge. One way to have qubits communicate is through spin spin interactions, but those tend to also destroy the coherence times. There might be other clever ways to enable communication between qubits so we can use two qubit gates but I'm unfamiliar with them.

&gt;Lastly, the biggest issue with spin qubits in in criteria 2, initialization. Unfortunately, many of the spin qubits systems rely on thermal Boltzmann population and T1 relaxation to provide polarization. In order to get close to a pure starting state one needs to go to very high fields(&gt;3T) and very low temperature (&lt;4K) Though, optically generated polarization is a thing but just like with optical readout, you need to satisfy very specific photophysical conditions.

&gt;Overcoming these challenges is not just unique to the paper you cited, but to the very diverse field of electron spin qubits(which includes solid state defects, and a huge range different sized and composition molecules).

Do you think Archer knows something proprietary that we don't? If they had a way to overcome these challenges, would they just release it to the public (competitors)?",1608078486,QuantumComputing,CD_Johanna,Quantum,Comment,607
1666,"I wish I had $4000 to play with :P

I watched from 13 - 24 where he begins to focus on IP. There was very little additional information. With regards to his discussion of the qubit lifetime + coherence, I would strenuously disagree with him that the measured time of ~400 ns is good enough. He says that because you can see the oscillations it means you can coherently control them, that's true, but quantum computing requires very robust control (surface code &gt;99.9% control fidelity as minimum). Like Fueschsle says, electronics are good on timescales ~10 - 100 ns. So unless this lifetime can be extended by at least an order of magnitude I would suggest its a lost cause. It might be that this this lifetime will improve when measuring single carbon onions vs the large ensemble used in the measurements he is talking about.

But measuring individual carbon onions is going to be challenging. Kudos to them for actually proving that they can position individual onions, which is not trivial, even though ultimately it will be the easy part. The types of measurements they've done previously only work with large volumes of the onions. The only way I can think of measuring a single onion would be by coupling to a resonator, i.e. cQED. This will be hard and is not straight forward. And furthermore, it will require them to use the cryogenic dilution refrigerators they have claimed their technology wont need. So I guess they're not going the cQED path? In which case they either don't have or have not shared how they envision reading out and controlling these single carbon onions. Without cQED I also have no idea how they would couple the onions to do two qubit gates.

All these things together are why I think its a bit of scam. I'm sure they are actually performing experiments.

1670,"&gt;	Transpile() is as much a part of the qiskit language as range() is part of the python language.

&gt;	Your questions can be easily answered by looking at the definition, which it seems you keep refusing to do.

I’m going to assume your answer to my questions was “yes it’s higher level” to all.  That expands the context of what constitutes a “programming language” to more of a “programming enviornment” so it might be reasonable to include features of something like Vivado, including packaged libraries of components when talking about VHDL/verilog.  At which point, yeah, that’s a fairly high level language.  I’ll agree with you on that now that I understand what you meant by VHDL.


&gt;	Would you consider a calculator that only performs addition and subtraction not helpful for arithmetic because it only did basic operations?

Yes but I don’t care whether it does addition with a ripple-carry adder or a look ahead added.  It may help with runtime, but it doesn’t help me compose my equation.


&gt;	The gates aren't the instructions. Qiskit is designed to work with any quantum computer, be it superconducting or trapped ion. Yet each of these will have different instructions (just like how assembly is specific to an architecture) for applying a Hadamard gate, yet with qiskit all you have to do is type "".h"", no matter the instruction set.

The gates that most people design their algorithms with (CNOT and single qubit gates) *are* the hardware instruction set for superconducting Qubits.  For ions it’s Molmer-sorenson and single qubits.  If you want to get really picky, the single qubit gates end up as ZXZXZ where the Zs are parameterized for superconducting, and XYZ with each gate parameterized for ions.  The exposed gates are fixed formulas which directly correlate to a fixed sequence of hardware gates, which is why I am likening them to pseudo-instructions.  Yes, that means qiskit is higher level than hardware-targeted qiskit or qasm or pulse descriptions, but it’s still in the regime of being analogous to classical assembly.


&gt;	Weird how you say you don't know much about VHDL then proceed to make claims about VHDL. And this isn't the first time you've said something completely wrong about VHDL

Weird how knowledge about a programming language also comes on a spectrum.  I’ve taken a class on verilog once, but I’ve been working with python and qiskit for years.

&gt;	That even has an example of a for loop executed at run time.

Which example?  They all look like they get run at compile time to me.  A verilog “loop” at runtime would involve a register and a clock.

&gt;	Sure, but if I want to add 2 numbers in qiskit, you can just type ""a + b"".

***Python* is a high-level *classical* programming language.  Qiskit allows you to program a *quantum* computer at a *low-level***.  If you type “a+b” in your qiskit code, you are doing *classical* addition in python, and nothing gets run on your quantum computer.

&gt;	You have to remember variable indices when you write classical programs too...

When you are working with something higher-level than assembly, you can have variables where you don’t even need to worry about where they get stored - it’s handled for you.  In languages like Python, you don’t even have the option of choosing where the variables are stored.

&gt;	This isn't like classical computing where there's only a few gates. Qiskit allows you to make any gate you want with arbitrary rotations.

Hardware quantum computers can perform single qubit gates with arbitrary rotations.  That’s in the hardware instruction set for both ions and superconducting qubits.  As for multi-qubit gates, not that much.  Qiskit does include some rudimentary synthesizers, but for the most part, you are going to be working with the provided gateset.

&gt;	You don't have to know anything about gates.

There is literally no currently existing way to program a quantum computer except by arranging quantum logic gates.

&gt;	A mathematician with no knowledge of the machine instructions used in a quantum computer could write code to implement a quantum algorithm. Just like a mathematician with no knowledge of x86 architecture can sit at a Mac and write code to implement a classical algorithm.

It is possible to a limited extent to specify quantum programs in terms of unitary gates beyond the basic provided list through the use of synthesis tools.  Qiskit does include a practical 2-qubit synthesis tool, and a mostly impractical 3-4 qubit synthesis tool.  In that sense, yes, it’s possible to do this through tools available in qiskit.  However, most people don’t.  Writing a quantum program as a unitary gate is like writing a classical program as a truth table.  For the most part, people write classical programs with and,or,not and quantum programs with CNOT and single qubit gates.  I’ll admit, the inclusion of rudimentary synthesis does make qiskit higher-level than if it didn’t have that feature.  I’m not sure where that would place it relative to classical analogs, since I have never written classical programs in terms of truth tables, so I do not know of tools to do so.


&gt;	Just like Python allows you to write classical code that, when run on a classical computer, generates classical machine code that runs on a classical computer.

Im going to change the example to C because Python is normally interpreted rather than compiled.  Your C program isn’t *run* to generate machine code, it’s processed by a compiler.  That compiler might execute your C preprocesser macros, which affect the generated program.  There is a distinction between metaprogramming code that is executed at compile time and code that is executed at runtime: in particular, compile time code can not make decisions based on runtime data.  Based on the earlier discussion, using an IDE makes your code higher level.  I agree with that, and the idea that meta code that affects the binary *is* “part of the program”, but I think there still is an important distinction.

So here is my question for you:

Does metaprogramming code that *doesn’t affect the compiled binary* count as “part of the program”?  (E.g. print statements in your python code that generates assembly, comments in your code (especially ones that can get parsed to generate documentation), code from an unrelated project open in your IDE.  How about qiskit code that doesn’t affect the arrangement of quantum gates?).",1608059190,QuantumComputing,Mazetron,Quantum,Comment,1068

The technology is still in its infancy. They really want people to be able to program in qiskit which is a python framework to send commands to IBMs cloud hardware but it's been open for months...the applications and use cases of this technology are still developing because of hardware limitations and problem types the hardware can actually solve reliably. I've been looking to jump into this side of computer tech for a while being trained as an analytical chemist with a programming background and it seems a bit early but technology moves fast so try and do something original while the direction of the field is still broad.,1608035052,QuantumComputing,marcuscontagius,Quantum,Comment,144

&gt;I'd argue its an example of natural language in *python*, for calling a tool on your quantum program, that isn't itself part of the *quantum programming langauge*, just like how the command ""gcc"" is not part of the *C* programming language.

Transpile() is as much a part of the qiskit language as range() is part of the python language.


&gt;I'm not sure what you mean here.  I think basic optimizations are neither required nor sufficient for a tool to be considered something that ""helps with circuit design"".

Would you consider a calculator that only performs addition and subtraction not helpful for arithmetic because it only did basic operations?

&gt;You *do* need to understand how to write quantum programs on the *instruction* level when working with qiskit, and that is going to include understanding the hardware gates, which are the most commonly used.

The gates aren't the instructions. Qiskit is designed to work with any quantum computer, be it superconducting or trapped ion. Yet each of these will have different instructions (just like how assembly is specific to an architecture) for applying a Hadamard gate, yet with qiskit all you have to do is type "".h"", no matter the instruction set.

&gt;&gt;A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.
In contrast, assembly languages are considered low-level because they are very close to machine languages.

https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/high_level_language.html


&gt;Sorry, I'm less well versed in VHDL than I am in Python.

So then are you willing to concede that there are loops in VHDL that operate almost identically to loops in python?


&gt;Loops in verilog and qiskit are used to duplicate a programming language instruction or set of instructions, especially when you need different inputs to those instructions.  They are executed at *compile time*.  Python/C loops are used to repeat the same instruction with the same inputs multiple times at *runtime*.  A clear way to see the difference is how runtime values can affect the loop condition in Python/C but not in VHDL/Qiskit.

Weird how you say you don't know much about VHDL then proceed to make claims about VHDL. And this isn't the first time you've said something completely wrong about VHDL:

&gt;&gt;In VHDL behavioral code, i.e. when we write a VHDL code of a test bench in a pure behavioral model, the **FOR-LOOP usage statement can be considered as a common SW implementation of a loop statement as in the other SW languages.**

https://surf-vhdl.com/vhdl-for-loop-statement/

That even has an example of a for loop executed at run time.


&gt;Why do you think its easier to work in qiskit than in verilog?  Qiskit is distinctly lacking some of the shorthand verilog has, such as integer math operators and being able to manipulate an entire multi-bit ""wire"" at once.

Python is easier than VHDL/verilog and since qiskit is built upon python, it inherits those traits. 

&gt;No you can't!  If you want to add two numbers on a *quantum computer*, you have to build your adder up from basic gates!  

Sure, but if I want to add 2 numbers in **qiskit**, you can just type ""a + b"".

&gt;If you want a variable, you have to decide which qubit(s) are your variable and remember their indices as you write your code!

You have to remember variable indices when you write classical programs too...


&gt;Still, implementing existing algorithms to write a quantum program requires an understanding of quantum computing on the gate level (at least enough to be able to read and interpret a paper on an algorithm and write qiskit code based on that).

You don't have to know anything about gates. This isn't like classical computing where there's only a few gates. Qiskit allows you to make any gate you want with arbitrary rotations. A mathematician with no knowledge of the machine instructions used in a quantum computer could write code to implement a quantum algorithm. Just like a mathematician with no knowledge of x86 architecture can sit at a Mac and write code to implement a classical algorithm.


&gt;Qiskit allows you to write *classical* python code that, when run on a *classical* computer, *generates* quantum code that runs on a *quantum* computer.

Just like Python allows you to write *classical* code that, when run on a *classical* computer, *generates* classical machine code that runs on a *classical* computer.


&gt;* Is assembly written using some sort of IDE a higher-level language than assembly written with a basic text editor?

&gt;* What about writing Python that generates assembly, where the ""end product"" program is the machine code assembled from that generated assembly?

&gt;* What about assembly with/without [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Macros)?

Your questions can be easily answered by looking at the definition, which it seems you keep refusing to do:

&gt;&gt;In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how ""high-level"" a programming language is.[1]

Would you consider something without basic optimizations to help with circuit design??


&gt;because you have to work with individual Qubits and the instruction set of the quantum computer directly.

No you don't. I have no idea what kind of quantum computer IBM has or what instructions it supports, yet I can write a **program** and send it instructions.


&gt;Again, you are talking about python for classical programming.

OH MY GOD. IT WAS VHDL. VHDL loops end with ""loop"". Python loops end with "":"". Doesn't the fact that you confused the two show how similar they are? You're not mistaking assembly for python.

&gt; It has objects and functions and branches and loops, and more.

And so does qiskit.


&gt;I am arguing that’s analogous to classical assembly.

Then you're arguing a against a straw man. My whole point is that qiskit is a higher level language and is easier than VHDL/verilog

&gt;But qiskit does *not* provide *higher level abstractions*.

I'm gonna have to call you out on this. You literally just said:

&gt;&gt;qiskit does have a few small abstractions over qasm.

You can do everything in Qiskit that you can do in python.

If you consider some basic optimizations “helping with circuit design” then sure, but it doesn’t change the level of understanding of how a quantum computer works that you need in order to write quantum programs.


&gt;	Yes it does! You can treat a whole quantum register as a variable!

That’s a *classical* variable, existing in the classical python part of the code.  I agree that python is a high-level classical language.  My argument is the *quantum* programming provided through qiskit is low-level, because you have to work with individual Qubits and the instruction set of the quantum computer directly.

&gt;	Really? How much work is: “For *x* in *y* loop”

Again, you are talking about python for classical programming.  If you want a *quantum* loop, you would have to do something like run a circuit, partially measure it, and decide what to run afterwords based on that measurement.  Qiskit does have the capability to do things like that, but your code will be something like applying classically-controlled quantum gates to your circuit.


&gt;	But no one else uses this definition for high level. Javascript doesn't have any handholding in creating an app?

Yes it does.  It has objects and functions and branches and loops, and more.  Since you don’t like my own words, I’ll go back to Wikipedia: “The amount of abstraction provided defines how ""high-level"" a programming language is.”  The only quantum abstraction in Qiskit is offering gates instead of pulses, and it will handle topology for you.  I am arguing that’s analogous to classical assembly.


&gt;	Qiskit and Q# are honestly so much easier to work with than VHDL/Verilog.

If you are saying qiskit provides *more convenient tools*, sure.  But qiskit does *not* provide *higher level abstractions*.  Even verilog has abstractions like being able to implicitly include adders, for example.


&gt;	“However, this is all a spectrum.” You're finally getting it!!! “In the end - what’s the point here?” The same point I've been making since the beginning!!!!


Are you getting it though?  Python is a programming language that lets even inexperienced programmers write some basic programs.  Qiskit is a tools that lets researchers with highly specific skill sets develop quantum programs.  Regardless of whether you draw the line at “anything above machine code is high level” or “C++ is a low-level language”, qiskit is a much lower-level *quantum* programming language than popular classical languages like C or Python.

&gt; I'm hearing you - Right now there is no chip, and there are just corporate talking points. 

Glad we agree on this essential point. Because you seem to have just agreed that you're basing your judgement on corporate talking points and not substantive demonstrations of the technology.

From press release 1: 

&gt;“We are incredibly proud of these latest results which show that we are making significant progress toward our goal of qubit control. Achieving qubit control is required for operational devices and would be major validation of the commercial viability of the 12CQ chip. “Archer is well-funded and on-track to continue its 12CQ chip technology development, with a key focus on demonstrating few and single-qubit control.” 

Without any substantive discussion of the experiments that have been performed the CEO says they have not achieved even single qubit control. ""Significant progress"" is intentionally vague. Without any technical descriptions or results the CEO is hoping, as you have done, that investors will read the most favorable interpretation.

&gt; Archer has now built a number of the qubit control devices (“QC Devices”) required for 12CQ chip development, optimising its first QC Devices (ASX ann. 10 Aug 2020). The Company has engineered and commenced operating the infrastructure and specialised equipment required to perform qubit control using various QC Device configurations (Image 1). 

Interpretation: they have built some devices and have measured some things in a university lab they have paid to access. Also note that the setup pictured is a \*cryogenic\* measurement setup. 

&gt;It is important to note that the greatest amount of value creation in quantum computing is generated from technology development§ and Archer is one of very few companies in the world that are successfully developing and building a quantum computing qubit processor† . 

In plain English they are admitting they are only attempting to capture IP.

&gt; Furthermore, the head scientist working on this developed the single atom transistor. I think they have all the right people working on this.

Cool paper. I'm not here to denigrate Fuechsle. But who else is on the team? How big is the quantum computing team? A large team is required to make a serious effort. Just look at IBM, Google, Rigetti, etc. We're talking &gt;50 people. Even if Fuechsle were God he wouldn't be able to build a QC by himself.

&gt;The CEO won the Conforth Medal for most outstanding PhD in chemistry, and authored this paper on room temperature control of qubits with carbon nanospheres 

Personally I wouldn't claim that driving Rabi's of a large ensemble is the same as a qubit. Otherwise every MRI machine is a quantum computer and the hydrogen in your body is the qubit. It is a good first step. But its a much bigger challenge to do these experiments on single carbon nanospheres. Where is the evidence they have achieved this? Even if they had, how will they couple two qubits together?

&gt;So, I see this as investing in potential. I understand the risks and I only have money invested that I can afford to lose. What are your concerns about these milestones and the backgrounds of the key scientists?

Until they show \*some\* evidence, \*any\* evidence that they actually have coherent control of even a single qubit, I cannot see how Archer could even be on the map of ""possible contenders"" for building a quantum computer. I think their press releases clearly shows they're inflating very preliminary results and that their real strategy is to try to develop some IP that can be acquired, not to actually develop any quantum hardware.",1607992552,QuantumComputing,MoSchoolMoProblems,Quantum,Comment,627

Qiskit doesn’t have quantum variables or loops!  VHDL and qiskit may have loops and variables that serve as shorthand for generating a repeated structure, but this is distinctly different from logical loops and variables like you would find in a “high level classical programming language” like C.

But the critical point is that there is no handholding in writing your quantum algorithm.  You need a low-level understanding of quantum logic, and you write your algorithms in terms of hardware-level gates.  Similarly, VHDL requires a low-level understanding of classical logic gates, and assembly requires a low-level understanding of what classical processors do.

However, this is all a spectrum.  Assembly is “high level” compared to machine code.  QASM is higher than pulse descriptions, and qiskit does have a few small abstractions over qasm.  It’s hard to compare these different technologies, but I think it’s safe to say that qiskit is closer to assembly than to C (for quantum programming, python is obviously higher than C for classical programming).

In the end - what’s the point here?  The current quantum “programming languages” are little more than wrappers over the hardware’s instruction set.

An observable associates quantum states with measurement values. When your measurement device reads a value, then you know your system is in a certain quantum state .  In the case of projective measurements -- where the quantum state you get when reading a value is a pure state |psi&gt;  -- the measurements can be represented by a Hermitian operator (M= \\sum\_i \\lambda\_i |psi&gt;&lt;psi|) where Hermitian means  M=M\* .

Meanwhile gates transform quantum states into other quantum states. In the case where the gates are perfectly coherent (ie they always map pure states to pure states) then they can be represented by a unitary operator  U, where U\* U = I (ie if you apply the gate, and then you apply the reverse of the gate, you get back the state you started with)

Some unitary operators are also Hermitian operators. This happens to be true for Pauli matrices.

Each additional qubit does not increase the computing power by even an exponential, yet the investment costs of the equipment required to add each additional qubit are super-linear. Furthermore, advances in machine learning are decreasing the costs of computing on standard silicon by orders of magnitude, and these advances specifically enable many of the same tasks targeted by quantum computing (physics simulations, basically any linear algebra-based computation, etc.) So the economic barrier to QC is increasing even as the underlying technology of QC is being advanced.

1735,"Oftentimes, an oracle is just a placeholder for some computation that we want to take as a black box.  We generally don't want to think about how a particular computation could be carried out, even though there are very easy ways to explicitly compute it.  In particular, there are often ways to instantiate the oracle with simple algorithms that fit into the oracular framework, so we can still get the quantum speedups over any classical algorithm that used these same subroutines.  We just can't prove that without using these subroutines in a black-box manner that there isn't some very smart classical algorithm that solves the problem quickly (i.e, we don't have a proof that P doesn't equal NP).

For example, the black box could be as simple as asking whether the i-th bit of a string is a zero or a one, and the computation is just looking up that particular bit in the bit string.  There are some complications that arise from assuming quantum access to this type of system, but it is a perfectly reasonable thing to think about.  

We can also instantiate the oracle for Grover search of a satisfying 3-SAT assignment.  The instantiation would simply be checking whether a particular string satisfies the particular 3-SAT problem.  We know of efficient algorithms to perform this check (namely checking all of the predicates and making sure that they are all true), and at each step of the quantum algorithm we simply run this algorithm.  We can prove that any classical algorithm that runs over the possible assignments and checks whether that assignment is correct needs to run over all of the possible strings in the worst case, but using Grover we only need to run this check over about square-root of the total number of possible assigments.

1778," &gt; however a qubit can only point up or down physically
This actually isn't always true, and the reason its usually true is because that is how we define the Bloch sphere, like choosing what time is ""t=0"" or placing the origin in other problems.  Usually we decide on a measurement we are going to make on our qubit, and define our block sphere such that the outcomes of that measurement are up and down.  However, there is no reason why you can't define your bloch sphere to be off from the measurement, such as the [Hadamard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform).  If you have a system where there are multiple measurements of the same value you could make, each measurement will have a pair of results that you could put on the bloch sphere, aligned differently.  In the case of a spin-based qubit, there can actually be a literal physical interpretation of the bloch sphere in real 3D space.


 &gt; qubits are normalized by |a|2+|b|2=1. why couldn't it be |a|+|b|=1 or |a|3+|b|3=1 etc

1st I want to point out that |a| is generally defined as |a| = sqrt(|a|^2).  2nd is that quantum mechanics describes particles as obeying wavefunctions, and waves tend to have [intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)) that scales based on the square of the amplitude.  Quantum wavefunctions are waves of probability, so the condition that the probability of *something* to happen being 1 is the condition that the sum of the squares of the amplitudes corresponding to all possible events totals to 1.  Note that the coefficients in qubit states are really just abstracted coefficients for linear combinations of wavefunctions of the physical system being used as a qubit. 

 &gt; why do we use complex numbers
I can try to come up with a more satisfying explanation, but I would say its because we needed another degree of freedom to explain phyiscal effects, and the math that comes from using complex wavefunctions works out to matching well with reality, largely due to cyclical and wave-like nature of many quantum effects.

 &gt; why 3d space, why not 4d or whatever?
For a single qubit, you have 2 degrees of freedom (the magnitude difference and the phase difference between the two states).  2 angles describes the surface of a 3D sphere.  For systems with more degrees of freedom (such as qutrits or systems of multiple qubits) you need a higher-dimensional bloch sphere.

 &gt; why does this probability vector behave as if it was just an orientation of any object in our physical world?

I would say it really doesn't?


The more general answer to your questions is that yeah its a convenient tool that works nicely, and you can argue over whether there is more significance or not.  But a lot of physics is like that.",1607692250,QuantumComputing,Mazetron,Quantum,Comment,459

As I see it, there are three natural ways to add another single dimension to the real numbers in a way that participates in multiplication: complex numbers, split-complex numbers, and dual numbers. These can be thought respectively as “borrowing from the absolute value”, “lending to the absolute value”, and “ignoring the absolute value”. The complex numbers seem to be the only one that allows you to tuck probability away in an hidden dimension that affects reality but conserves total probability.",1607631038,QuantumComputing,rotuami,Quantum,Comment,92

1807,"It’s only a model. The directions on the Bloch sphere do not need to correspond to directions in physical space.

The reason is because it’s topologically correct - the sphere has the right dimensions and the right shape. You could flatten it out (like how maps flatten the globe) but it would involve tearing the space.

The Bloch sphere maps “complex projective 2-space” - the pairs of complex numbers constrained so the vector length is 1. If you look at the “real projective 2-space” - (the pairs of real numbers so the length of the vector is 1), you would get a circle.

As for why the Euclidean norm, it’s because that’s the only norm which works nicely. The dot product describes the relation between vectors and the Euclidean norm is what you get when you use that dot product to define a norm.

It really depends if you are interested in the conceptual side or the technical side of Quantum computing (QC) and/or mechanics (QM). 

For the conceptual:
YouTube is definitely a great resource, Kurzgesagt, frame of essence, PBS infinity, Veritasium, computerphile, just to name a few have great videos about QC. 

If you want to dive deeper and learn how a QC operates and algorithms
- get very confident in precalc: trigonometry, complex numbers
- move on to linear algebra, this is the bedrock of QM and QC
- basic probability theory (uniform distribution, probability normalization etc)
- maybe some complexity analysis? 

I suggest these resources in this order:
1. Khan academy for pre calc 
2. 3B1B for linear algebra (search on YouTube essence of linear algebra). There are also great textbooks about Lin alg. It’s already an interesting topic in itself.
3. Brilliant.org for introductory quantum computing 
4. Nielsen and Chung or Qiskit Textbook to get started with QC (former for theory, latter more application based)

1860,"I’d say it would be extremely useful in simulating quantum data. From what I’ve read the biggest impact will be in the field of chemistry, especially pharmacy. Hopefully we could develop ground breaking drugs and treat diseases we wouldn’t be able to without the aid of quantum computers. also might force us to change how we approach encryption . I reckon generally, sensitive government data will be much harder to hack since people will probably develop new quantum data encryption methods. 
All this is with the assumption quantum computers will actually be stable",1607572048,QuantumComputing,baesianinference,Quantum,Comment,93
1861,"&gt;Either way, I think it’s a moot point because all of the languages mentioned here, HDL, assembly, and qasm, are all low-level languages.  What makes them low-level is the fact that you don’t have shorthands for common structures like loops, variables, objects, and pointers, which you have in a high-level language like C.

I take it you didn't even look at the examples, did you?

VHDL and Qiskit both have loops, variables, objects.

That is not what makes something high level either.

&gt;In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how ""high-level"" a programming language is.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language

And ultimately:

&gt;The language has similar qualities to traditional hardware description languages such as Verilog.

1935,"Just to add to a great response--central to a proper understanding of quantum computing (and quantum mechanics in general are:

1. Linear algebra (seriously, you can never know too much linear algebra)
2. The Born rule

Ultimately, linear algebra is what allows you to perform computations on both the |0&gt; and the |1&gt; bit at the same time (what's really happening is you are doing computations on a linear combination, or superposition, of these two bits. So stuff like 1/sqrt(2) |0&gt; +  1/sqrt(2) |1&gt; is perfectly legal as an input, where before in classical computing we were forced to choose between 0 and 1). This happens before measurement. After a computation is performed, we are left with combinations of qubits where each qubit is in a state like this.

The second we measure, things get a bit more interesting thanks to the Born rule. The Born rule dictates what we can actually measure in a lab (or in a computer). Thing is, you can't actually measure these in-between states like sqrt(3)/2|0&gt; +  1/sqrt(2) |1&gt; : once the system interacts with the environment (e.g. measurement), it selects one of the two states, |0&gt; or |1&gt;, and that's what we measure. These coefficients determine the probability of observing the system in either of these states: so in this case, the probabilities of observing |0&gt; vs |1&gt; are

P( observe |0&gt; ) = |sqrt(3)/2|\^2 = 3/4

P( observe |1&gt; ) = |1/2|\^2 = 1/4

(the absolute values are because these coefficients take values in complex numbers). 

This means to determine the output of some computation, you usually have to run the same program several times and do statistics on it. The art of it all comes in clever ways of making these computations execute in a way that these probabilities aren't spread out among many possible solutions. So for example, if your quantum computer spits out the desired output (a) 50% of the time, and some ""false"" solutions (b) and (c) 25% of the time, we would have to perform the same computation many times to eventually believe output (a) is the true solution (think of trying to decide whether a coin is biased or not). Compare this situation to the one where we cleverly design an algorithm that spits out the desired output (a) 90% of the time, and the ""false"" solutions (b) and (c) 5% of the time. We don't need to run the same test too many times to realize ""oh, (a) is the output corresponding to the right answer"" since we know the probability distribution beforehand.",1607295052,QuantumComputing,the_Rag1,Quantum,Comment,427

1938,"&gt;Then here is my question: from a PURELY SOLVING EFFICIENCY stand point, is a quantum computer always better than a classical one whatever the faced problem to be solved ?

It helps to remember that a quantum gate computer is essentially an ordinary digital computer (or 'classical' computer) in every way except that it adds hardware that can interface with quantum logic gates if the instructions in your software call for it. 

If your software application doesn't use quantum logic in its instructions, then a quantum computer is about equal in performance to a similarly equipped non-quantum computer.",1607288513,QuantumComputing,nnsmkngsctn,Quantum,Comment,98
1939,"No, smaller and affordable are not the characteristics you'll be looking for. For the moment there's no way quantum computers phase out classical computers. 

Right now most QCs are connected to a CC because they need to apply error correction algorithms to clean up the results, this probably won't change any time soon.

There are more detailed models than that, but for the sake of vocabulary, ""region"" and ""system"" are terms for whatever you define them as in the specific problem.

If I am studying a Hydrogen atom in a trap, a reasonable model might be to call the Hydrogen atom the system, the area within the trap the region of interest, with some simple model for what the trap looks like (such as a potential well).  My measurement of the hydrogen atom would be described as collapsing the wavefunction and returning a result.  However, if I wanted/needed a more detailed model, I might come up with a quantum mechanical description of my particular measurement device (say a photon hitting the atom and then hitting a detector).  Now I have a more detailed model, and the ""system"" now includes the photon, but the detector is outside the ""system/region"" of interest.  If I add a model for the detector as a circuit with some description of electrons flowing through a wire, I now have an expanded and more detailed system, but at some level I am going to abstract where the electrons are coming from/going to, and possibly more importantly, the flow of entropy (or equivalently the flow of information).  Wavefunction collapse is the result of information leaving the system described mathematically and exiting into the external universe.

The corresponding single bit computer could only have the states *at* these endpoints but the quantum computer’s state could be anywhere in between these points.

Adding a second and third bit (y and z, each between -1 and 1). The state space of the corresponding classical computer is the 8 corners of the cube. But the quantum state could be anywhere on the edges or interior of the cube.

However, what makes the Copenhagen interpretation different from other ""interpretations"" is mostly philosophical.

They are different interpretations of the same theory, which produce the same predictions and thus cannot be experimentally differentiated.

In the classical case, you're limited to choosing two points which are indicated by either (`a` = 1, `b` = 0), or (`a` = 0, `b` = 1). As u/Hypsochromic said, these correspond to the north and south poles of the sphere. In the quantum case, we can choose any value for `a` and `b` as long as it satisfies the equation |`a`|\^2 + |`b`|\^2 = 1.

2076,"&gt;Implementing error correction is arguably what defines the post-NISQ era.

Error correction is literally all about noise. If you don't have noise, you don't need error correction. It's not just quantum either, if we had noiseless classical communication, we wouldn't need classical error correction:

&gt;&gt;Quantum error correction (QEC) is used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other **quantum noise**.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction

Here's what a article co-authored by Preskill says:

&gt;&gt;Quantum error correction (QEC) ... is a method for reducing noise in quantum channels and quantum processors. In principle, it enables a noisy quantum computer to simulate faithfully an ideal quantum computer, with reasonable overhead cost, if the noise is not too strong or too strongly correlated.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02510-3


&gt;Nevertheless, it is a software thing that requires a very different skillset to building a QC.

QEC is absolutely a hardware thing:

&gt;&gt;Back in 2001, theoretical physicists Daniel Gottesman, Alexei Kitaev and John Preskill proposed storing information non-locally in exotic quantum states of an oscillator that became known as GKP states. “Everybody knows that the uncertainty principle says you can’t measure with arbitrary precision both the position and the momentum of a harmonic oscillator,” explains Preskill, who is at Caltech. “But it turns out that you can prepare a state of a particle or an oscillator, then someone – while your back is turned – can come along and shift it a little in position and momentum, and you can measure both shifts to arbitrary accuracy if you promise that they are small. If you look at one of these states in position space it looks like a grid, and if you look at it in momentum space it looks the same way; so if you shift the comb by less than half the distance between the teeth, you can measure the distance by which it’s been shifted. So you can encode information in these states and the noise in the lab can be measured and corrected.”

While Shor's algorithm is commonly used as THE example of a practical application of QC, many of the applications in finance and business have not been realised yet, so its hard to even predict the capacity required to perform such tasks.

However the problem for complex tasks in business is not going to be creating a QC with say 5000+ qubits, but quantum coherence and the capacity to store information for more than just 0.1 seconds on a particle.

If I were to just throw out a prediction to when we will see QCs being used in business/practical uses I'd say 2050-2060. Some might say I'm pessimistic, others will say optimistic.",1606890896,QuantumComputing,VertixBuns,Quantum,Comment,218

I agree numpy and numba are super fast and you can do plenty of stuff with it (even more if you use cython, but you lose some readability). It depends on the types of problem you are interested in. I think Python is an amazing language and by no means would I suggest to abandon it.

2326,"&gt;While there are a couple problems you would run into, Googles Quantum Computer could mine all of Bitcoin in a couple seconds.

I do not believe this, and would love a link if you can provide it. Quantum computers have implications to two parts to the Bitcoin protocol. 

First, there is the electronic signature scheme used to separate the public and private keys associated with different Bitcoins. Shor's algorithm can efficiently deduce a private key from its corresponding public key. This is a huge security risk as it would allow someone with a quantum computer to steal Bitcoin from another user if they learned their public key. Of course, Shor's algorithm will require a much larger and better-performing quantum computer than is available today. 

The second is the proof-of-work or mining part of the protocol. Here, Bitcoin is mined by solving challenging cryptographic problems (inverting a hash function). This is much more resistant to a quantum attack as quantum computers can only achieve a quadratic speedup over classical computers for this problem. This is done using Grover's algorithm. Current estimates indicate that, with the speed we expect from quantum computers in the short and medium term, [quantum computers will not be able to significantly outperform classical computers at mining Bitcoin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10377). 

So no, quantum computers could not mine all of Bitcoin in a couple of seconds. However, they may be very effective at stealing it.",1606158906,QuantumComputing,HaxtesR,Quantum,Comment,234

2328,"""A couple problems"" is laughable.  Google's Quantum Computer (barely) demonstrated computational advantage by using a crafted problem which utilized randomness. The hope was that the crafted randomness would outweigh the randomness of noise -- and it did, just enough to show they had control of quantum computer. This is actually really exciting. But quantum computers are not even close to being able to control 5+ qubits in a non-random way without noise just making results complete garbage. 

To get around this problem, you'd have to solve noise. Ideas include error correction, better hardware, algorithms that are noise-tolerant, etc.

But if you just want to theoretically understand how a perfect quantum computer could break encryption, then look into the Quantum Phase Algorithm and then Shor's Algorithm. Bitcoin uses an elliptic curve, where similar to prime factoring, the discrete-logarithm problem makes it hard to solve classically. Shor's algorithm solves the discrete-logarithm problem, and more generally, the [Hidden Subgroup Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem)",1606156021,QuantumComputing,RustyBamb00,Quantum,Comment,157

2330,"The short answer is a qualified yes. They can, theoretically, efficiently solve problems that could be used to do things like changing ledgers for similar reasons that they can do things like factor. However, don’t expect this any time soon. At all. I imagine the problems they are referring to relate to the fact that our current quantum computers are simply far too useless to do that in practice. You’d need a lot more high-fidelity qubits and likely at least some decent error correction. We aren’t there right now. I don’t even think we’re that close. I think 10 years is an almost optimistic estimate, and at that point, cryptography will likely have adapted to meet the challenge.

2332,"For building yes you probably would have to have a good mastery of all the undergrad topics and some grad topics as well. But I'm a mechatronics engineering major and am not well versed in their actual mechanics and the physics that goes into producing them at least deeper than what everybody already knows. 

To know what problems are solvable and/or more efficient on a QC I advise you to read on computational complexity theory and especially check out the different complexity classes such as BQP, it stands for bounded-error quantum polynomial time. And as Deutsch's problem prooves some problems are definitely faster on a quantum computer but yes, practically not all. Classical computers are insanely efficient and error-proof on most algorithms in existence. So much so that for most classical applications they would leave the QCs in their dust. That is because modern QCs use a classical computer for controller and needs to constantly check for errors as qubits are very very sensitive to environment noise such as heat fluctuations. 

Also it might be a disappointment (or a relief because you won't feel as rushed) but I would advise you to not take the QC news too seriously, media acts like quantum computers are just around the corner and they will instantly squash cancer and make time travel possible but in truth they are barely able to solve some arbitrary problems just for the sake of showcasing quantum supremacy and they don't have any actual practicality as much as I'm aware. But to gain back some faith in the area you can check out Shor's Algorithm and Grover's Algorithm, I would even advise you to download and try to read Grover's paper as it's very well written and might pique your interest in getting yourself familiar with some heavy mathematical proofs such as why some problems must be faster on an ideal quantum computer etc.",1606146512,QuantumComputing,Marnsghol,Quantum,Comment,316

I've seen a lot of people go through the early stages of their careers. Doing any qualification represents a certain amount of risk. But with specialised technical ones like this, the risk goes both ways. Yes, perhaps the field will die down, research avenues will be found to be dead ends, and it'll be hard to find a job. Maybe you'll have to retrain. But there's also the chance that you'll be an early expert in a growing field. If you apply yourself, and do well, then you may end up in a senior, highly paid position well before you might do otherwise. It's harder to do that from a more general qualification. You need to decide for yourself whether you're willing to take the risk. Investigate the potential of the field. Everyone will have some kind of vested interest. What do they say? Why? 

Another take on this altogether is that, by taking specialized technical subjects, you will learn *how to learn*. If it turns out your technical qualifications are in the wrong area, you will be able to pick up new areas quickly. This is a valuable skill to have throughout your career.

If you are studying quantum computers to be able to write algorithms for it those are what you need. But because you are in highschool as long as you got linear algebra and bssic complexity theory covered you can toy around with different ideas and codes in QC simulators. QC simulators by the way don't use actual quantum computers as their name suggests they just simulate quantum states and decoherence. But I believe you can upload your qiskit code to IBM's platform to actually run it on their quantum computer but I never tried it or found it necessary with my applications.

Personally and logically I would say don't be hard on yourself in learning Quantum Computers, because ""learning"" QC is 99% reading pure math proofs and 1% is learning quantum gates are just matrix transformations that... well... transform the state of the system in a reversible way. After you learn about the gates, what they actually do and what the ""states"" actually are. Think about what you like about the quantum computers, meaning would you want to make a quantum computer or write programs for it. Because the two requires different set of skills. And try to improve those and visit back to relearn everything.

2391,"Yeah, so any gate that a quantum computer implements will have to be unitary. But as I described, you can look at a subsystem of a quantum computer and actually see non-unitary operations. Moreover, measurement itself is a non-unitary operation -- which is what the paper you linked utilizes. This is weird right? These are perfectly valid transformations, yet sticking to unitary operators does not let us describe them! How would I describe the transformation of my subsystem B, or of measurement? Well you can use quantum operations!

Quantum operations capture any transformation that a quantum system can perform. A gate, or a unitary operation, is just a special case of a quantum operation. Measurement is also a special case of a [quantum operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics#State_change_due_to_measurement). So quantum operations do not have to be unitary, but do have to be physical -- that is they should remain linear (and also satisfy ""trace"" conditions).

So you can completely design an algorithm or an idea by using quantum operations. When you actually want to implement the quantum operations on a quantum computer, you are forced to use unitary gate. Well, you can do something like I describe to implement a quantum operation using unitary gates.

Researchers, depending on the problem, will switch between using quantum operations and state/unitary-operator formalism. For example, those who work in quantum error-correction will most likely the quantum operation formalism because when you only look at a computer (system B) which interacts with an environment (system A), the computer will appear to have non-unitary operations. But if you looked at both A+B, the system will evolve in a unitary way and you can use state/unitary-operator formalism -- but this is hard to do because you would also need to know how the environment evolves.",1606065483,QuantumComputing,RustyBamb00,Quantum,Comment,294

2425,"Many of the quantum computers right now preform operations by evolving a system subject to a Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is hermitian, so it will give you a unitary evolution operator and hence your quantum gates will be unitary.

Now, it is still possible to perform effective non-unitary operations. Consider the addition of an ancilla-qubit (system A) which you entangle with the rest of the qubits that you care about (system B). You can apply a gate to both system A and system B and the operation will be unitary.  But if you only observe system B, the qubits you care about, the operation can look non-unitary.

The general mathematical formalism to describe this is called Quantum operations. Many ideas and algorithms are formulated using quantum operations (e.g. HHL). Quantum operations do not have to be unitary, but they do have to be linear. There are serious computation implications if you do have a non-linear quantum mechanics/computing.

So to answer your question, doing extra grovers’ iterations will actually get you a worse answer even on a noise-free simulation.

3. when you start solving a problem first make a table with two columns.column 1: theoretical concepts you use, mathematical tricks you use. write down the physical concept with which you are planning to tackle it and update the math column as you move along with the question. when you get stuck it's much easier to look back and find out which one's bugging you.

&gt;Researchers led by City College of New York physicist Pouyan Ghaemi report the development of a quantum algorithm with the potential to study a class of many-electron quantums system using quantum computers. Their paper, entitled “Creating and Manipulating a Laughlin-Type ν=1/3 Fractional Quantum Hall State on a Quantum Computer with Linear Depth Circuits,” appears in the December issue of PRX Quantum, a journal of the American Physical Society. 
“Quantum physics is the fundamental theory of nature which leads to formation of molecules and the resulting matter around us,” said Ghaemi, assistant professor in CCNY’s Division of Science. “It is already known that when we have a macroscopic number of quantum particles, such as electrons in the metal, which interact with each other, novel phenomena such as superconductivity emerge.”
However, until now, according to Ghaemi, tools to study systems with large numbers of interacting quantum particles and their novel properties have been extremely limited. 
“Our research has developed a quantum algorithm which can be used to study a class of many-electron quantum systems using quantum computers. Our algorithm opens a new venue to use the new quantum devices to study problems which are quite challenging to study using classical computers. Our results are new and motivate many follow up studies,” added Ghaemi.
On possible applications for this advancement, Ghaemi, who’s also affiliated with the Graduate Center, CUNY noted: “Quantum computers have witnessed extensive developments during the last few years. Development of new quantum algorithms, regardless of their direct application, will contribute to realize applications of quantum computers.
“I believe the direct application of our results is to provide tools to improve quantum computing devices. Their direct real-life application would emerge when quantum computers can be used for daily life applications.”
His collaborators included scientists from: Western Washington University, University of California, Santa Barbara; Google AI Quantum and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

2525,"Particles become entangled by interacting. Generally, any two interacting particles will become entangled with each other, and they will remain entangled until they interact sufficiently with other systems. 

Entangled particles that are far away from each other had to be close enough at some point in the past in order to interact, or alternatively had to both interact with a third particle that traveled between them (such as a photon). Generation of entanglement cannot break causality, in the sense that entanglement between distant particles cannot be generated faster than the speed of light.

However, the existence of entanglement does not generally depend on the distance between the entangled parties; they can, in principle, be as far away as you'd like. This does not break causality, because the mere existence of entanglement cannot be used to transmit information without additional communication.",1605478203,QuantumComputing,TheSumOfAllPeanuts,Quantum,Comment,140

2578,"This is kind of the crux of the thing. There are not only 2 states of spin. 

In the classical picture, you can have the particle spinning about any axis, so if that spin is creating some kind of force field (let's say a magnetic field), you could measure how much of the force on your test apparatus is directed along the x,y,z axes. Each of these components represents some fraction of the total, and they sum to 1 under (vector) addition.

When a similar experiment is tried with something like an electron, what ends up happening is that no matter which axis you decide to test, you find that all of the spin is directed along that axis. The ""2 states"" thing is because it can be directed in the positive or negative direction of that axis. This does not mean that these are the only 2 possible states; it only means that once you've decided which axis to measure (which has the same amount of freedom as the classical case), these are the only 2 results you can measure.

Look up classical entanglement or classical nonseparbility.  by constructing a Hilbert space from the linear solutions to classical maxwells equations, you can do any “quantum” information processing that doesn’t require multiphoton interference (for example you can not do Boson sampling).  Multiphoton interference is a result of quantization of the EM field and non-commuting nature of the creation/annihilation operators.  

However,  for a classical EM field you can have both superposition of eigensolutions as well as nonseparable states (mathematically equivalent to quantum entanglement, but does not have nonlocality).  So, using superposition and the mathematical equivalent of entanglement in a classical EM field, you can do a lot of “quantum” information schemes albeit with some limitations.  

Coherent states are the most “classical” quantum state you can construct, so it is similarly motivated to what you are talking about.",1604935894,QuantumComputing,vacuum_state,Quantum,Comment,156

Questions like “what is the expected value of my measurement” and “what are the outcomes and probabilities of my measurement” become impossible to clearly define.


The condition for defining a measurement operator is the condition of being self-adjoint, and equivalently, of having orthogonal eigenvectors for non-degenerate eigenvalues, and this is precisely the requirement to be able to calculate probabilities of different outcomes.


Note that you totally can describe your state in a different basis, but your measurement operator will have an orthonormal basis, so you will effectively have to convert to an orthonormal basis in order to calculate probabilities.

Also, you have misunderstood the Bloch sphere (to be fair it’s kinda confusing).  The two basis vectors are on opposite sides *because* they are orthogonal.  The Bloch sphere is a description of the surface of the sphere, it does not have any description of points not on the surface.  Movement around the block sphere happens solely as rotations.

The entire vector space spanned by the basis is fair game. For example, a qubit can be in the state |0&gt; + |1&gt;. This is what people mean when they say a qubit can be true and false at the same time, although it isn't really both true and false at the same time, rather it's in some other state that is a linear combination of true and false. This means you can do more computations than you can classically.

2793,"Depends on the side of QC you want to get into. Seems like your background would be more suited for the algorithmic side of QC rather than the hardware. 

Out of the 3 options, #3 would be the best. #1 is not related to QC at all. #2 would probably be very difficult to pivot into unless you already have a very significant physics background equivalent to a BA/BS in physics, so unless you had a particular reason for wanting to go into theoretical physics, it would probably not be worth the effort. However, even #3 not ideal - you want to go for something a little deeper in computer science theory and math.

If your end goal is a PhD, then you should start pursuing research as soon as possible. This also leads into the next bit of advice - it's probably better to choose the department based on the professors in that department whose research you are interested in.

2801,"Most quantum computers today are designed and built by research physicists, so either grad students or researchers hired by companies such as Google or Amazon.  The actual manufacturing is done at various fabrication labs.  The manufacturing process may be done by the researchers themselves, manufacturing lab staff, or some combination.


The techniques used to make a quantum computer depends on the type of qubit technology, as needs can differ greatly.  Superconducting qubits, which are kinda the most popular/most successful qubit technology right now, mostly use the same techniques used for making classical computer chips, which allow a precise pattern to be etched into silicon, but there are some unusual techniques needed to add key components (such as Josephson junctions).



So far I’ve been talking just about the quantum chip itself.  This would be the analog of the CPU in your classical computer.  Of course, your classical computer also has RAM, a battery, a screen, a cooling system, a motherboard to connect everything together, etc.  A quantum computer also needs a lot of other components.


-	Cooling: Quantum computing chips generally need to be cooled to extreme temperatures.  This is done using what’s called a “dilution fridge”, which looks like a Russian nesting doll of metal cylinders with a bunch of tubs coming out the top.  These are manufactured by companies that specialize in making research equipment (quantum computers are definitely not the first application of these).
-	Vacuum: Air would be solid at the temperatures needed for quantum computing, so you really need to suck all that out before cooling it.  A series of pipes with powerful vacuum fans are used to suck all the air out.  The result is that the inside of the fridge is at a stronger vacuum level than outer space (at least in our solar system).
-	User Interaction: Classical computers are used to design the wave pulses used to send to the quantum computer.  The researcher will design experiments, either directly designing the wave pulse, or relying on a stack of software tools to do so.  This is analogous to writing a program either as assembly or in a programming language and using existing tools to generate the assembly.  (I work on such tools!)
-	Interconnection: A bunch of microwave waveguides (like small metal pipes) are used to manipulate the quantum chip and read data from it.  These waveguides go to a series of classical electronics which are in charge of generating wave pulses to send, or analyzing the wave pulses received.  These classical electronics are connected to the previously mentioned classical computer.



I hope this helps and wasn’t too long.  Let you know if you have any questions, or want more detail!  Also, this is all based on my experience from working in a university quantum computing lab that used superconducting qubits.  Things may differ somewhat at companies like Google or labs using different qubit types.",1603762932,QuantumComputing,Mazetron,Quantum,Comment,483
2802,"For superconducting (if only talking about the actual quantum chip at the bottom of the dilution fridge) is largely just lithography (used in classical fabrication) and a small part of e-beam writing/deposition for the josephson junctions which is new(ish).

All the lithography layers tends to be microwave circuitry (coplanar waveguides for the most part). Who is responsible will vary on the size of the group/company, but will tend to be a few people doing the layout design (in CAD) and the actual fabrication process.  Grad students would tend to be doing all of the steps.

2822,"Depends what you want to do.   Of course everything in science and information processing require the translation of any ideas to the language of maths.   However if you want to go into implementation of quantum technology then you need a VERY solid background in physics.   These technologies are incredibly difficult to create (which is why we are 40 years into the field of quantum information science and just now getting to points where meaningful implementations seem feasible).   

Arguably, you actually need to know very little about quantum mechanics beyond understanding two state systems and entanglement in order to do theoretical quantum information science.   This requires a solid foundation of linear algebra.   You can look at David Merman’s book on quantum computing for computer scientists as an example of a text that is very light in actual physical quantum mechanics.   

To summarize, if you want to work on actually making these ideas realizable in a physical system then you need a very strong foundation in quantum mechanics, and from an engineering perspective concepts in optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, etc.   most of this work is highly collaborative and is a tour de force with challenges that span many disciplines.   There may be a team with people very strong in quantum mechanics but not very good at engineering working alongside people whose strong suits are electrical engineering.  

For example, right now I work with a group that is in quantum networking, which require people who come from backgrounds in quantum communications, quantum optics, classical optics, optical engineers, electrical engineers, classical networking,  atomic physicists, quantum computing experts and so on.   Much of the progress comes from the collaborative conversations of teaching everyone in the group about each of the expertises so that all of those perspectives can be used to tackle the challenges hindering progress.  

For example, say, an expert classical network theorist is introduced to quantum mechanics so that they can think of how one can apply the concepts developed for network controls in the classical internet to quantum networking.  

You really need to find what you are interested in.   There are so many technological challenges that need to be addressed in order for quantum technology to actual make an impact.   These are very difficult problems that require big communities to come together.   Find one of these challenging problems you are interested in and then go from there.

Edit:  when I say you need to find what your interest is, I mean this in a broader sense for someone going into undergrad.  I went into my physics degree thinking I wanted to work on theoretical cosmology and ended up going to grad school for quantum optics with a focus on experimental quantum communication.  So, my main advice is if you want to go into quantum technology, major in physics and do a minor/double major in math/computer science.   However there are many more paths such electrical, optical engineering.   But use undergrad to as a means to pick a subject ur most generally interested and keep your mind open.

So, what does this weird extra CNOT do? Well, trace 1s from the beginning and observe the bitflips on the target qubits. In the end, you should see the solution. Plus, you should have intuition on why everything is where it is in the circuit: this qubit controls that qubit because of the effect you can observe on the target.

Particles are entangled until they are disturbed, for example by a measurement (there are also clever things you can do to duplicate states and things, but that's beyond this comment and unnecessary to the discussion). Until it's measured, the particles are in a superposition. Once one is measured (and the outcome of the measurement, critically, is random), the actual state of both particles is absolutely determined, which seems to happen faster than light. 

Can we send a message like this, if we could in theory capture every particle that was sent? No, sadly. To send a message, you need to disturb one of the entangled pair, which has a similar effect to measuring it, and then ruins the entanglement. Then any further measurement is meaningless, because they're not entangled any more.

0) Great job writing your thoughts down and organizing them for others to review!

1) You probably explain qubits on the other pages, but it would be nice to see that on p.1 since the quantum properties of a qubit enable all of the other concepts like quantum supremacy, the physical role that quantum matter plays in processing information (thus we need vacuums, cold temps, coherence), superposition error correction challenges, etc. 

2) Does quantum supremacy necessarily imply exponential speedup, as opposed to (e.g.) quadratic or other speedups?  To my thinking, it's just a matter of demonstrating a QC-characteristic solution to any problem that is intractable for a classical computer

3) The range of ""3 days to 10,000 years"" is a little fuzzy, and purposefully misleading (but not by you!).  I think it's helpful to have a short short short detour to explain the discrepancy between Google's claim (10K years) and IBM's objections (3 days)

2891,"I don't have answers to all your questions, but I can address some of them, at least. Hope it helps.

Quantum computing is as viable as any high-tech specialization, and more viable than most. We're in the middle of a big push for quantum technology, with a lot of companies investing in research, hardware, algorithms, and more. It looks like the field will keep growing, as far as anyone can tell, so you could do worse in terms of specializations.

Waterloo is among a handful of universities to make quantum computing a research priority, and they are one of the top in the field. They're definitely the best place in Canada for general QC, and probably have the best overall math, physics, and nanoscience departments (again, in Canada) to approach the technology from all angles.

I can't speak to payout, as it depends and I'm not quite in that field. The best specialization depends on your interests and background - do you like more theoretical work, or coding, or getting your hands dirty with actual qubits? There's ongoing work in all of these areas, so read up on what's happening and see what catches your interest.

I haven't done actual QC myself, but many of my colleagues have (I'm a grad student in physics/engineering). On the hardware side it's experimental, mostly working with very large fridges and measuring qubit states, entanglement, and so on, to try to make them more stable, easier to measure, and more. Programming is a bit different than classical, because you really can't escape the math if you want to understand it.

As to what you should know, again it depends on where you want to specialize: if you just want to code, you might not need to know as much condensed matter physics, for example. But a general understanding of quantum physics, with a strong helping of linear algebra, is an absolute necessity no matter what. Beyond that, programming helps, and condensed matter/superconductivity/magnetism/optics (depending on the type of qubit).",1603205072,QuantumComputing,xenotranshumanist,Quantum,Comment,334

See a recent comment of mine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/jakuza/if_you_were_stranded_on_an_desert_island_in_the/g8sm6wy?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for some references.

The limitation of analog computers is *noise*. Specifically, noise in an analog computer is additive. So when you connect components together, the noise from each component feeds into all subsequent components. Digital computers use saturation and noise-margins (both of which are power-intensive) to operate at extremely low noise levels. And the little bit of noise in sensitive components of the machine can (and is) error-corrected using error-correction techniques.

The elephant in the QC room is that, at a high level, QC is facing precisely the same dichotomy as that between analog and digital computing, just at extremely small scales and power profiles. There is a naive error-correcting code call k-repetition. It works like this... suppose you want to transmit a bit-vector x0, x1, x2, ... xN. A 3-repetition code could do it this way: x0 x0 x0, x1 x1 x1, x2 x2 x2, ... xN xN xN. The receiver can use majority vote to correct some errors in this stream. It's a very inefficient code, but it works.

A digital computer is, physically, a quantum device. It is very hot and there is no practical distinction between the quantum and classical states in the machine. But we can think of each charge well in the digital computer as a Quantum Error correction code using k-repetition code where k is an extremely high number corresponding to the number of charge carriers[1] in the charge well, and the machine never accesses pure quantum states. The reason for thinking of a digital computer this way is to eliminate the magical and ultimately undefinable distinction between ""quantum"" and ""classical"" computing. A digital computer can be thought of as a really crappy quantum computer[2].

So, this is my thesis: eliminating noise and minimizing power in analog computations and increasing coherence times and noise-resilience of quantum computers will eventually lead to convergence on a common mathematical foundation because these are really just two different approaches to solving the same underlying physical and computational problems.

2975,"&gt; Edit: I do not know much about this, but could one say that quantum computers are equivalent to Turing machines?

A Turing machine can simulate any quantum computer without an oracle. This proves that quantum computers are in the first degree of the arithmetic hierarchy. A quantum computer can simulate a universal Turing machine (this proves Turing completeness).

That's not as remarkable of an achievement as it might sound. Rule 110 is Turing-complete and it can be written out in just 32 binary digits (or just 8 bits if we agree on how to number the cells). The Game of Life is Turing complete and it's as simple to describe as Rule 110.

At any finite energy level, a quantum computer cannot escape the first Turing degree. You need infinite energy to get to hyper-computation. Hyper-computation is computing something that a universal Turing machine could not compute.

Also, one last point (because I frequently encounter this misunderstanding): ""classical"" is not synonymous with ""digital"". So, just because an algorithm computing some function f would be slow on a digital computer doesn't necessarily mean there isn't a faster way to compute f using a different kind of classical computer, such as an analog computer. For example, using op-amps, you can build an analog computer that computes an elementary arithmetic function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in constant time even though multiplication or division are O( n^2 ) algorithms on a digital computer.",1602796192,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,240
2976,"A quantum computer can be simulated by a classical computer, it just takes an exponentially long amount of time. Similarly, a quantum computer can simulate a classical computer. We can then conclude that the class of problems they solve is the same.",1602795913,QuantumComputing,HaxtesR,Quantum,Comment,42
2977,"If one doesn’t care about runtime, then the set of problems that a quantum computer can solve is the same as a classical computer. This is because we can simulate quantum computers on classical computers: the state of a quantum computer is a vector, and the operations that we can do consist of multiplying that vector by a matrix. Classical computers can handle vectors/matrices, so they can simulate quantum computers. Of course, the size of these vector spaces grows exponentially with the number of qubits, which is why it’s quite difficult to simulate this efficiently. 

There are problems that we know can be solved faster on a quantum computer than on any classical computer: for instance [Grover’s Algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) gives a way to invert a function in O(sqrt(N)) time, whereas a classical computer needs O(N) time.

Edit: yes, it is correct to say that quantum computers are equivalent to Turing machines.",1602795393,QuantumComputing,Orpheus11235,Quantum,Comment,150

The main difficulty you’d find in a physics class is the style: physicists are used to making assumptions and approximations, frequently without clear justification.

My favourite example from undergraduate physics was in stat mech, when we had to estimate the core temperature of the Earth given only its mass and radius. The answer was to apply the Virial Theorem, which only applies to ideal gases. In other words, I had to assume that the Earth was entirely made of gas!

Make sure to communicate thoroughly with your professors (assuming you take physics classes in grad school) and stay away from classes taught by experimentalists until you’re a bit more up to speed. For reference, I came back to Physics for my PhD after an MSc in math and I had to relearn some old (bad) habits that physicists just do without really thinking.

What really matters is where you go to study (ie what kind of people they have there), who your advisor is, what kind of projects they have you working on, and most importantly your own self directed learning. You should make sure those things align with your interests.

3045,"Awesome! I can really only speak for myself but physics is still amazingly interesting to me, and I particularly love qc. It's a deep and varied field, both theoretically and experimentally, that's at a very exciting point right now. 

I feel any ranking I can give for promise would be sorely inadequate; a good answer requires an understanding of the nuances of these quite different technologies, which I lack. Frankly I don't think anyone has a really convincing answer (at least I haven't heard one). Generally the approach is that we should try as many things as possible and see what pans out. 

My comment about defects in solids was sourced from discussions with researchers working with NV centers. According to them, the field is leaning towards quantum sensing (where NV centers and other defects are doing amazing things). Quantum simulation is still very active, as well as using defects for quantum networks; but computing isn't as strong a direction as it used to be. If someone from the field disagrees with this take, please correct me.

I know ions best. I think ions are a very promising technology. The sort of ""straightforward"" approach for ion qc is limited to a few 10s of qubits; going beyond that requires a technological jump. However, there are several promising approaches for doing that, including using photonic links or shuttling ions around on a chip. Once the barrier is broken (and I'm almost certain it will be) ions could scale up to large registers. Ions also enjoy high quality building block operations.

Neutral atoms are relatively new players in the field. Their main advantage is that it is (comparatively) easy to see how one might scale up to thousands of qubits. However, the basic building blocks are not as mature and as high quality as that of ions or sc qubits (yet). There are a lot of open questions here.

Sc qubits are of course very powerful and quite mature. They're the qubits of choice for google and ibm for a reason. I can't really comment on how difficult it would be to scale up to thousands of qubits. I'll leave that to an sc pro to answer.

Quantum dots or silicon qubits are an interesting player. If I understand correctly, generating a proper high quality qubit is very difficult. So far, this technology has shown less results than the others in this list. However, once one does figure out a way to do it, you'll enjoy a huge advantage from having the highly advanced tools of the silicon industry at your disposal.

I don't feel comfortable saying anything about photonic quantum computing. It's a different paradigm from the other technologies (measurement-based qc) and I'm not familiar at all with the main challenges there.",1602539599,QuantumComputing,TheSumOfAllPeanuts,Quantum,Comment,461
3046,"First, computer science is a theoretical concept. The existence of actual machines does not change the theoretical definitions. It might make them obsolete.

As mentioned before, quantum computers and Turing machines can do the exact same computations. Either can simulate the other (with enough overhead).

Now, quantum computers inspire new complexity classes. Whether they actually are distinct from known ones like P or NP is a major open problem (I think). Note that the existance of physical quantum computers is irrelevant to these complexity classes, just like the (likely) nonexistance of a nondeterministic Turing machine is.

Will quantum computers change programming? Well, maybe. It depends. I think they will only be relevant for huge number crunching tasks and become available as ""acceleration cards"" for normal PCs. So you write software the normal way and then maybe outsource parts to the quantum parts, kinda like you can outsource things to a GPU. So you will likely still write normal programs.As to how quantum programming languages will look, we don't know. Current approaches are more like imperatively putting bits into specific gates and more resemble a hardware description language.

3071,"I'm finishing my PhD (quantum dots, superconducting circuits). Solid state devices have a wide range of physics going on so that makes them particularly attractive to someone interested in materials and ""atomic"" physics. 

For all platforms (superconducting, semiconducting) understanding the physical origins of noise is pretty active and very physics-y. There has been a lot of nice work in superconducting qubits on radiation (e.g. nuclear decay, cosmic rays) suggesting it can be a limiting mechanism to qubit coherence at the few millisecond level (meaning other things currently limit performance) and potentially cause correlated errors in space/time across a chip which is undesirable for error correction (see [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09190),[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02286)). A nice overview of ""charge noise"" physics and current models is can be read [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01108).

As a bit of advice, I'd point out beyond a topic you're interested in there is a practical thing to consider as well: how difficult is it to study what you're interested in? I worked on quantum dots in silicon which are notoriously hard to make (complicated fabrication) and prone to being damaged by packaging (electrostatic discharge). I never got to study the physics I was interested in during my PhD (and not for lack of trying!). How easy it is to at least get to a situation where you can attempt to do/learn about the measurements you are interested in is an incredibly important thing to consider and something I wish I had appreciated before starting.

3111,"Super fun questions and some seriously good answers here. I’m an engineer and scientist and have developed some cool technology for NASA and “other” government agencies. Also well-funded private industry developing commercial products based on quantum technology. 

I know enough about this stuff to know that We (the royal we) are still mystified by much of quantum mechanics but nevertheless we are getting quite familiar with how it behaves. 

Drawing on some of what I’ve learned though my own study and from the women and men I’ve worked with who are much smarter than me, there does seem to be a limit to information density, and as one earlier commenter stated, it does seem to be dependent on surface area. 

Based on what we currently know, and this is evolving, the maximum information density possible is one bit per Planck area. 

If you want to geek out, this area is derived from three fundamental constants like this:

Planck area = G*h_bar/c^3. 

Where G is the gravitational constant, h_bar is the reduced Planck’s constant, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. 

This astoundingly small number works out to be about 2.6x10^-70 m2. Yes, to the minus seventy. 

The surface area of a Hydrogen atom, the smallest one, is on order of 3.5x10^-9 m2, this allows for the storage of about 10^61 bits of information. 

Not sure exactly how much information is on (or in) the Earth but you can use this number as a reasonable guide for digging deeper on the subject.

I'm not so sure how much it relates to quantum computing but I think the maximal amount of information that can be stored in an area actually scales according to the surface area of the space. This is kind of counter-intuitive for us, I like to think of the example of a hard drive. If we made the best possible hard drive to store all the information in the world it would only store as much information as its surface area allows, not it's volume! In fact, if you keep stuffing information into this hard drive it will eventually turn into a black hole. This is known as the ""Bekenstein bound"" and you can read about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein\_bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound).

3119,"I agree, as we cannot manipulate the outcome of a measurement, we depend on classical channels to report them. 

However, what if we consider the following:

2 entangled qubits Q1 and Q2 that form the system Q12

and

3 functions such that:

* for Q1, Flip(Q1) puts the system in superposition (Q12 = 1/sqrt2 \* (|00&gt; + |11&gt;))
* for Q2, Measure(Q2) measures the system and returns the value (by measuring Q2) (Q12 = 00 or Q12=11)
* Check(Q12) checks if the occurrence of either of the Q12 values in 1 t is 100%

In each unit of time t, Flip(Q1), Measure(Q2) and Check(Q12) can be executed x times

In each unit of time t, Flip(Q1) can either be executed exactly x times or not be executed at all

&amp;#x200B;

The result would then be something like this:

If Flip(Q1) = 1, Check(Q12) in 1 t will show &lt;100% occurrence for either value (ideally it would be 50%-50% between 00 and 11; but what is important is that they are less than 100%)

If Flip(Q1) = 0, Check(Q12) will show in 1 t exactly 100% occurrence for one of the two possible results (either 00 or 11)

&amp;#x200B;

Further exemplification:

if Alice wants to send Bob the value 1 at t=1, Alice would flip in t=1 =&gt; measure(Q2) &lt;100% =&gt; and Bob would read this as Bit = 1

if Alice wants to send Bob the value 0 at t=2, Alice would not flip in t=2 =&gt; measure{Q2) = 100% (either 00 or 11) =&gt; and Bob would read this as Bit = 0

TLDR the conserved quantity in a wave tends to be proportional to the amplitude squared, not the amplitude.




The reason you have to square the values is the same reason you have to [square Voltage when calculating power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance) and why you have to [square the amplitude of the electric field to get irradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance).  Same with calculating the power of sound waves.


One answer could just be “that’s how you get the units to work out”, but really given so many examples, it should be clear that something more fundamental is going on.  It’s a common property of waves that the value we want to measure to describe the “strength” of the wave is related to the square of the amplitude.  This is because of the way wave equations work, the flux of this amplitude squared property is conserved, so it tends to make sense that this amplitude squared is “the amount of stuff being moved”.



In Quantum Computing, your qubit states |0&gt; and |1&gt; are really just shorthand for eigenstates of the physical qubit system.  |0&gt; and |1&gt; are wavefunctions, and a|0&gt; + b|1&gt; is a joint wavefunction.

3187,"The abstract:

&gt;Quantum optical systems with cold atoms and ions provides one of the best ways to build controllable quantum many-body systems as quantum computers and quantum simulators. Here we report on recent developments in building, and in particular programming quantum simulators based on trapped ions as intermediate scale quantum devices. Our discussion will focus on hybrid classical-quantum scenarios: here the quantum part is the generation of highly entangled states on the quantum device in quench dynamics, which is combined with a classical post processing of measurement data, possibly run in a feedback loop with the quantum device. Examples highlighting these developments include the implementation of self-verifying variational quantum simulations, illustrated here by computing the ground state and quantum phase transition of a Schwinger Model as 1D QED. In addition, we develop and demonstrate a ‘randomized measurement toolbox’, allowing to access in experiments quantities like Renyi entanglement entropies and — as ongoing research — measure the entanglement spectrum, i.e. ‘seeing the Schmidt decomposition live’ in quench dynamics from an initial product state towards thermodynamic equilibrium.

Depending on whether you want to focus more on the device development side of things as opposed to the software development on top of that, both CS and Physics could be viable, especially as the scene continues to evolve.

3280,"1) I'm not really well-versed into these kinda things. The only thing that I have heard about that could maybe beat quantum computers are ""Black hole computers"" (computers that would use the time dilatation properties of a black hole to perform their computations extremely quicker). I don't know much about that, but one thing that I know for sure is that our current technology is extremely far away from what would be needed to build such computers (way more then it is for quantum computers!)


2) No, that's not how it works. Adding qubits will allow you to solve problems for larger inputs (and more slowly!). I'll give you an example :
If we look at factoring, classicaly, if I want to increase by 1 bit the size of my integers, then the required time to factor approximatly doubles (for example, it would take ~ double the time to factor 501 bits integer then it would for 500 integers). But on a quantum computer, the time required to solve inputs that are 1 bit larger (by adding 1 qubit) won't increase by a lot (still, it will increase). This is were our speedup comes from : adding 1 qubits to the quantum computer doesn't make it twice as fast. It's just that it doesn't make it twice as slow like it would on a classical computer. And this whole ""twice as"" thing only apply to problems where we would have an exponential speedup. Not all problems benefit from quantum computers like that!


3) For the same reason why it seems like classical computers won't solve NP-complete problems efficiently : people have tried to find polynomial algorithms for them, but they all have failed.


4) I don't really know. I guess any BQP problem that's not known to be in P would be interesting to solve, but maybe not : The first such problem that comes to my mind is factoring. But if we are able to factor efficiently, then we would be able to break RSA encryption, which will destroy the current security of the internet! (which might not be a good thing after all!)",1602004555,QuantumComputing,AshikabiKun,Quantum,Comment,355
3281,"I have a little different take then the other posts here. My understanding is the ""known speedups"" rely on error corrected quantum computers (i.e. they don't decohere or collapse while the computation is running). One strategy to getting there is to take many non-error corrected qubits (often called physical qubits) and use a control and measurement scheme that allows one to infer errors in time/space on the quantum chip giving you the opportunity to correct the problems as they occur. Or at least know what problems happened where and when allowing you to make sense of the noisy output. The overhead to error correct is pretty large, requiring entanglements with ancilla ""error detecting"" qubits, measurements of said ancilla, possibly correction gates to undo errors, and could swamp out many non-exponential speed ups. This is why there is so much focus by the academic and industry research teams to improve the physical qubits and look for clever ways to operate them quickly and accurately. 

To give an analogy that might make sense: it is kind of like trying to cook a meal while keeping a plate spinning on a stick. If the plate and stick are well balanced, you don't have to do much to keep it going so have time to do the cooking, but if you're constantly trying to keep the plate spinning and the stick upright you might not ever get around to making the meal.",1602004068,QuantumComputing,NSubsetH,Quantum,Comment,238

3285,"There aren't any NP-Complete problems known to be solvable efficiently by a quantum computer. And most experts think that there will never be any. BQP (the class of problems solvable in polynomial time on a quantum computer with a bounded margin of error, ie what's people will say are the problems efficiently solvable with a quantum computer) is though to not be contained in NP, and to not contain all of NP (and in particular, to not contain any NP-complete problems). (A diagram of the suspected relationship between BQP and other classes is available on the BQP wikipedia page). That's also something that make people say or think that quantum computers don't offer many advantages : NP-complete problems are natural problems we would like to solve efficiently, but we're pretty sure that we can't do that both on classical computers and on quantum computers (at least, no body ever found out how to solve even one of them efficiently, neither on classical computers nor on quantum computers). We would have liked quantum computers to solve them efficiently (thus giving us a massive speedup!), but it doesnt seem like it will be possible.


What you are talking about with search and protein folding kinda comes down to my 2) point at the end of my previous post. They are problems that can be solved much faster on a quantum computer! But for some people, that isnt enough compared to the hypothetical exponential speedups some other problems could have.


All quantum algorithms that I know of and that offer some sort of speedup ultimatly rely on parallelism. So there are  known ways to benefit from parallelism!  But for the problems were these benifits are confirmed and proven, some people find them too small. And for the problems where the speedups are big enough to satisfy these people, they are problems were we aren't even sure if classical computers couldn't do better (so the speedups wouldn't be that big after all).",1601978863,QuantumComputing,AshikabiKun,Quantum,Comment,328

3287,"It's not that they may not have any advantage over classical computers. For some problems, like searching a database, we already know how that quantum computers will offer an advantage over classical ones. As far as I'm aware, the debate is more on ""do quantum computers offer a big advange over classical ones"". I'll give you some examples :


""Small"" speedups : Grover's algorithm allows us to search an unsorted database in time O(sqrt(N)) instead of the O(N) time that a classical computer requires. This is a speedup, and a really good one : it's a quadratic speedup. But for some people a quadratic speedup is not as good as they would like. For instance, if your database has an exponential size, then a quadratic speedup would still give us an exponential seach time. In other words, if we have a problem that we can't solve efficiently on a classical computer, then Grover's algorithm could give us a a quadratic speedup, but the whole thing would remain unefficient : that speedup isn't enough to make a that big of a difference.


""Not really"" speedups : The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm allows a quantum computer to figure out in constant time ( ie, almost instantly) and with 100% certainty in which of two very restricted categories does a given function fall into (assuming that the function indeed falls into one of these two categories). Whereas a classical computer would require exponential time to do so. This thus give us a massive speedup! However, there are 2 problems with that. Firstly, it if we allow the classical computer an extremely small and negligible margin of error, then the classical computer can also solve the same problem in constant time. Secondly, the Deutsch–Jozsa problem is completely artifical and has no practical uses. So, our speedup here isn't a speedup anymore when we consider probabilistic classical computers, and when we don't it's a massive speedup but for a useless problem. Not that big of a deal after all...


""maybe big"" speedups : Shor's algorithm allows us to factor a large integer into prime numbers efficiently on a quantum computer, whereas the best currently known algorithm for factoring on a classical computer is unefficient. So, we do have a massive speedup here. However, there is a twist : we still don't know whether or not factoring could be done efficiently on a classical computer or not. Maybe there is such an algorithm, and we just haven't found it yet (in which case, there would be no quantum speedup!) Many people have tried and failed, but the possibility (albeit low) of an efficient classical algorithm still remains. So, right now, the speedup here comes from our lack of knowledge about classical computers! Whether it is or isn't a real speedup remains to be proven. (And there are some similar cases where a though-to-be quantum speedup was disproven, which is my next example!)

""were though to be big but finally weren't"" speedups : Similarly to my previous example with factoring, in 2016, an efficiant quantum algorithm that made use of the HHL algorithm was found for the ""recommandation problem"". At the time of its discovery, the best known classical algorithms were unefficient, so we had what seemed like an exponential speedup! And many people believed that it was indeed! However, about 2 years ago, a student name Ewin Tang found a classical efficient algorithm for that problem. So what appeared like a massive speedup (like it appears right now with factoring and Shor's algorithm) finaly wasn't.


To end off, here's what you need to remember :

1) There are some problems that quantum computers can't solve faster than classical ones;

2) There are some problems that quantum computers can solve faster, but not that much faster (Still, it is faster! That is an advantage, and quantum computers are not useless. If and when large quantum computers are built, they will have some interesting usage, though they might not be revolutionary);

3) We are still unsure whether or not there are some problems where quantum computers would offer a big advantage over classical computers. That's the main point of debate here. Although, if it happens that quantum computers don't offer any large speedups, in practice, they still would until it has been proven otherwise. For example, if we are able to build large quantum computers that can factor efficiently by 2050, but someone finds that classical computers can do the same in 2100, then that would still leave us with some 50 years where quantum computers would have offered a significant advantage over classical ones!

That said, quantum computing is a completely different way of harnessing nature to make calculations. I think you're losing the point a bit if you're trying to make a 1:1 comparison between classical computers and quantum computers.

The best way to understand the advantage of quantum computers is to understand [computational complexity classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_complexity_classes). These are categories that we can place different types of mathematical problems (algorithms) into.

The most important categories are P and NP.

Every algorithm that a classical computer can solve within a reasonable amount of time is part of P. As the input increases the computational time increases polynomially, so nothing gets too out of a control for a classical computer to compute.

Every algorithm that a classical computer **cannot** solve within a reasonable amount of time is part of NP. The time to solve these problems grows **exponentially** as the input increases, so very soon you would need a classical computer the size of the entire universe to attempt to solve them and it would still take millennia to complete.

Quantum computers attempt to exploit some strange quirks with nature to solve problems differently. A classical bit has two states: 0 or 1. Thanks to superposition a qubit can be in a state of 0, 1, or anywhere in between (maybe 20% 0 and 80% 1). Two entangled qubits can share information with each other instantaneously - faster than the speed of light. These are the properties that can *sometimes* offer a speed advantage with *some* problems.

We're hoping that the result is that some NP problems become BQP problems - problems that a classical computer solves in exponential time, but a quantum computer solves in polynomial time.

It's unlikely that quantum computers will replace home PCs, but it's still way too early to make good predictions about their capabilities.

3340,"You're confusing the speed of electricity and the speed of computing.

The speed of computing is more so like the speed I'm allowed to flicker my electricity. If I cannot flicker my electricity (reliably), quickly, then data isn't going fast enough, (think Morse code). 

Beyond that, there's another bottle neck in the speed of computing. The ""algorithmic complexity"", this concerns the programming of the computer, (think of algorithms as a set of instructions for the computer to follow) . Certain problems use different algorithms that we make, some as fast and some are slow. Adding up numbers is fast, sorting numbers are hard, picking very cheap plane tickets to earn a profit is very hard (Google traveling salesman).

The fastness of quantum computers comes in to play at this algorithmic complexity idea. When we write algorithms, there are certain operations that are provided to the programmer, and the idea is to combine them into more complicated operations. For example, regular computers provide you operations like, add, subtract, save, load, etc, then the goal is to make useful complicated operations like add many numbers together, sort numbers, find minimum, find maximum, etc. These make take longer or shorter time depending on how many times it uses the basic operations.

The specialty of quantum computers, is that these basic operations are different, because we're using weird small things. The idea is that we have to make new programs that use different basic operations, and these new programs might use the basic operations a different number of times (hopefully less).",1601751176,QuantumComputing,CoffeeVector,Quantum,Comment,257

One is quantum entanglement, which is faster than the speed of light, whereby observing the position/momentum/value of one entangled qubit instantaneously gives you the opposite for another entangled qubit. Another is parallel computing by being able to compute 2\^n different states (as opposed to 2n states where n = the number of bits)

One famous example is finding the factors of a number.

IBM defines QV as 2 to the power of the depth of the largest depth=width circuit that can accurately give outputs to some problem, specifically the ""heavy output generation problem.""

So, to double your QV, ""all"" you have to do is add a single qubit and then make the protocol work with that. Clearly, it's difficult work expanding the circuit, but to me it seems like a marketing ploy to define QV in a way that a linear increase in the number of qubits leads to an exponential increase in QV. (Yes, the Hilbert space does increase exponentially the same way QV does,  but I think it's confusing to the layperson who could believes IBM's plans to double the QV yearly is a quantum equivalent to Moore's law, i.e. midtakenly think that doubling QV implies the number of qubits doubled. Whereas others, like Google, are claiming they can achieve the real quantum equivalent to Moore's law, the Dowling-Neven Law, where you get an exponential increase in the number of qubits and a *doubly*-expontential increase in the Hilbert space over time.)

Also, IBM's current definition requires you to classically simulate the circuit first to determine what the heavy outputs should be.

3374,"I see, I guess I'd need to read more about how they're using the vibrational modes of the 1D lattice to do the gate (e.g. I don't know what the physical spacing is, so I'm unsure what length of trap starts having frequency crowding issues you're talking about). 

Right now, solid state platforms are all brute forcing the wiring problem and that works to some degree. Cue a pic of a google DR and you'll see why that approach as it is currently done is unsustainable. There are some high density wiring approaches that take less space than standard coax cables (""flex cables"") but it isn't widely used so the jury is out if that'll have the performance one needs. 

Integrating the control circuitry on the same die is probably not going to happen anytime soon, the footprint for something like an AWG is going to be several mm of chip space (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14185 for an example of a 4 channel awg on a 4x4mm^2 area chip) and that is a lot of area on a chip. CMOS approaches generally dissipate a lot of power, so you can't even put them on the mixing chamber to begin with. So you're talking at best some sort of routing between the mixing chamber and 3K plate. 

If you assume you're going to have to route signals from say, 3K to the qubit chip you're going to need some clever way to bring hundreds or  thousands of individual signal lines onto a single die. Wire bonding is a tried and true method but it is untenable at the hundreds to thousands of signal lines due to limited chip perimeter and they can introduce unwanted signal cross talk (the cross talk may be at an acceptable level, the limit on how many individual lines will probably cripple this route first). Bump bonding is another solution, but the bump density will be limited by how small the contacts are on the packaging PCB (if we're really optimistic maybe 10x10 mils^2 or 0.25x0.25 mm^2 area for the pad). So you're talking an upper bound of 16 signals per mm^2. In reality you'll probably be limited to something like 2-4/mm^2.  State of the art chip from google or IBM is something like 400 mm^2 area. So now you're max'd out at 1600 lines which actually is pretty good (more than the supremacy experiment needed). Eventually you'll need to make the chips bigger to add qubits so maybe the density here is sufficient to brute force until you hit the limit of a silicon wafer ~300mm diameter or surface area of ~70,000 mm^2. At that point, you need to either have a clever scheme for entangling between wafer-sized dies or make the qubit smaller (too small and the control wiring density will limit you!). 

Right now, the best proposals I've seen suggest a PCB -&gt; signal routing chip -&gt; interposer chip -&gt; qubit chip for the signal flow. (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11146 for a nice discussion on this).

IonQ's proposal to get around this is to use optical heralded entanglement between different traps (it was at some point at least, idk if  they are still wanting to do this).

3436,"I am a PhD student working for a superconducting QC lab at a major US university, and can say that, although applied physicists still dominate the hardware space, engineers are becoming more critical in our work. The reason for this really boils down to scale and complexity: for small systems or new types of qubits (like fluxonium, quasi-charge, or 0-pi) the problems are typically more physical in nature and often require a deeper understanding of circuit quantization and quantum electrodynamics. Sure, engineers still play some role, and we have tons of support staff to help us, especially in the nano fabrication part of things, but at the end of the day 90% of the work is done by the physicists. Often times, to get results, we will hack stuff together until it works, however at scale this tends to be incredibly inefficient: we may use a $100,000 network analyzer to do our characterization and time-domain measurements, which is fine for a single qubit but for even a couple of qubits proves unusable (and insanely expensive/overkill). This has led us to work more closely with engineers in various specialties. A good example is in high speed DAC/ADC implementation for real-time feedback and control. The time evolution of our systems is typically nanoseconds, so we require control pulses and data acquisition bandwidths of many GS/s (giga-samples/second). To do this at scale we have been working on multi-channel direct synthesization of signals using very high speed FPGAs over many channels. To implement this is quite difficult, and would be like designing your own graphics card from scratch. To do this we work closely with groups that specialize in these systems and are led by people who are experts in high-speed mixed-signal design and using Verilog and VHDL for FPGA implementation. We also work with big companies on developing new RF hardware for our specific needs, especially for cryogenic compatibility and IR reduction (a big source of qubit decoherence). As time goes on I expect these sorts of relationships to be more common, both on the signal and development side. My work includes a lot of materials engineering and rf design and research. At this point I think of myself as an engineer more than a physicist.   


So, with this in mind, what do you need to get into quantum computing? Well, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to get into hardware (qubit/chip design, etc) the best route is to go into applied physics (I have my BSE in engineering physics) and get internships in quantum labs. If the computer science aspect is more important to you, a route in CS or applied math (or better yet, both) is the best route. Some exposure to quantum in a physics context is good but not necessary if you are only interested in algorithms. If quantum theory is your thing than a BS in physics (and mathematical physics) is probably the way to go. If you want to work in between there is a big need for software-hardware development on the signal side. Things like optimal control and feedback are big points of interest, so if you can get into mixed-signal RF implementation, FPGA, or work on software for interfacing these systems or running simulations, you will be a big asset for a large quantum lab. A much less popular route is cryogenics engineer (in the case of superconducting QC). I actually started in part as a cryo person, but transitioned into the hardware side of things when I started my PhD. This route is probably the hardest though because cryogenics as a field of study, atleast in the US, is quite limited. I was hired for a very specific reason that really boiled down to luck and some specific know-how I possessed at the time.

Another good book whatever your background is [Quantum Computing and Quantum Information](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2R5GL7DE17CKC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=quantum+computing+and+quantum+information&amp;qid=1601113168&amp;sprefix=Quantum+Computing+and+Q%2Cstripbooks%2C157&amp;sr=8-2) by Nielsen and Chuang, which is sort of the standard introductory textbook in the field — I've generally found it quite well explained, and it goes all the way from explaining the necessary prerequisites in Linear Algebra and Computer Science, through to explaining various quantum algorithms, quantum error-correcting codes, and some quantum information theory. This is also just a good reference book to have, if you get further into the field.

Also, if you are interested in getting started with programming quantum computers, then it might be worth learning to use a quantum computing language. For example qiskit (IBM's python quantum computing library) has quite a lot of good learning materials such as the [qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html), which teaches the fundamentals quantum computing as well as of the language, or alternatively the lectures from their course [Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware](https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/), which covers similar topics, and also explains some of the physics of super-conducting quantum computers.

Now, these 'QuTech' courses are actually also available to students of the computer science MSc. (and I believe for the applied math as well). That brings me to my question: What program coordinator at the TUDelft did you contact? Was it for Applied Physics, or for the computer science MSc.?

Because if you haven't tried the CS MSc. you could go down that road. It's a really good MSc. program actually, just realize that it's not only about QC.

Some other thoughts:

Going into QC only really starts in your second year of the masters, because you can do your thesis at QuTech. This is 3/4 - a whole year and that's where your QC 'education' mostly happens. Most things happening at QuTech are actually on the hardware development side, but there are some groups that are actually purely software/information science. These groups also officially fall under the wing of the computer science faculty so you'll definitely be able to do your thesis there as a CS student (although you will be housed in the physics faculty where all of QuTech is)

3540,"&gt; Hi, I am trying to read up on quantum computers but all articles and YT videos I could find oversimplify the problem drastically.

That's the truth!

&gt; I have a basic understanding of how the computations work with qubits. It is my understanding that QC works basically backward. They perform a calculation on an unknown input and then collapse the superposition of the result qubits to the desired input.

This is a misunderstanding. A quantum computer is, at root, a *reversible* computer. See [reversible computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing). Because the mathematics work ""in both directions"", you can either ""compute forward"" (that is, from inputs to outputs) or ""compute backward"" (that is, from outputs to inputs). But ""which direction"" you are computing is purely abstract. That is just mathematics and has (essentially) nothing to do with the physical hardware itself which always proceeds from the electronic inputs to electronic outputs. See [this excellent article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/heres-a-blueprint-for-a-practical-quantum-computer) to get an intuition for how a real QC is physically constructed and operated. So the *physical* inputs to the QC are always inputs, never outputs. And ditto for the outputs. But *what we are computing* may be either an output (forward mode) or input (reverse mode).

For example, consider the simplest possible quantum circuit... the identity circuit (wire). So, I just prepare a qubit (in either |0&gt; or |1&gt; state) and measure it. That's it. Did my measurement ""reverse collapse back to the inputs""? Well, physics tells us that it did, but that's not what we are doing at an operational level. The operational steps are (1) prepare the qubit (in whichever state), (2) wait for some duration that is determined by the device physics (3) measure the qubit. The mathematics that describes the physics of this circuit ""works both ways"". But, operationally, we work in only one direction and the entire physical apparatus of the QC (except for the quantum state itself, within the coherence time) is also unidirectional.

---

Bonus:

What follows is a non-QC person's description of how to calculate a function in reverse. This is not specific to QC but we can use QC to implement such reverse calculations.

To calculate a function in reverse using a QC, you must first completely describe the function in terms of quantum gates. Now, you fix the output of the function to be calculated (in reverse) to the *input* of the quantum circuit (that is, the prepared states), and you map the inputs of the function to be calculated to the *outputs* (that is, the measured states) of the quantum circuit. This might be confusing, so I will explain with functional notation.

Let q(v0,v1,..vN,t) be a quantum circuit with qubits v0..vN. I added the parameter t to indicate operational time (do not confuse this with the time-parameter of the wave-equation itself). At t=0, we prepare v0..vN with some state vector. At t=1 (let's normalize t), we measure v0..vN and this is the result of q on v0..vN. Let us suppose we are using q to solve a function f with M inputs and M outputs, so (y0,y1,...yM) = f(x0,x1,...xM). Note [1]. 

So, we prepare the qubits according to some mapping from &lt;y0..yM&gt; to &lt;v0..vN&gt;. So this will become q(v0..vN,t=0). After some delay, we measure the qubits. From the output distribution, we should have some mapping from &lt;v0..vN&gt; (that is, q(v0..vN,t=1)) to &lt;x0..xM&gt;. In this way, we calculate the inputs of f from its outputs. And we can do this because the quantum circuit is inherently reversible, so it's just a matter of which ""direction"" you choose to prepare the state from.

[1] In case this notation is confusing, you can rewrite it as the solution of N functions each having one output:

y0 = f0(x0,x1...xM)

y1 = f1(x0,x1...xM)

...

yM = fM(x0,x1...xM)",1600639411,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,625
3541,"&gt;I want to try to find a valid solution for a problem. The best way I know to do that is to try every possible candidate and test if it solves the problem

Kind of true.

You apply gates to your input qubits, once you have finished your calculation the qubit is still the same, only the information it's carrying is different. 

So initially all your qubits are in the 0 state and then you apply gates to them according to the algorithm i.e. finding the prime factors to a number x. And at the end of the algorithm you measure your qubits and then there is a high probability that you get the right answer, i.e. a (non trivial) factor of your number X.

Now understanding how you get that non trivial factor or in your words how to set X isn't as easy as it sounds. IIRC (and it's been a while that I looked into this) that's because you operate not on all positive integer numbers but only on a subset that is defined between 0 and x-1.

I want to try to find a valid solution for a problem. The best way I know to do that is to try every possible candidate and test if it solves the problem. 

For example, I want to find two prime numbers, that when multiplied together give me a number I know, x. With a traditional computer, I would have to try candidates one by one. But qubits and quantum gate allow me to multiply two numbers made out of qubits, that can be any number. The qubits of the result will be quantumly entangled with the number I am multiplying.

3549,"&gt;couldn't they get a different key-value?

Yes. This is exactly the reason why there is a step at the end where Bob and Alice sacrifice half (or less) of their qubits to compare them publicly (their actual values, not the ""filters"" they used) and see if they actually match. If they have a slight error rate (\~10% according to some), they decide that someone was eavesdropping, and they start over.

This happens because if someone is eavesdropping, they also have a 50% chance of guessing the base (""filter"") correctly. Take what I say with a grain of salt. I did a project on BB84 last semester and I only assume I got this stuff right because of my grade, lol.  


From various sources that I used to write said assignment.

[BB84 on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84)

&gt; From the remaining k bits where both Alice and Bob measured in the same basis, Alice randomly chooses k/2 bits and discloses her choices over the public channel. Both Alice and Bob announce these bits publicly and run a check to see whether more than a certain number of them agree. If this check passes, Alice and Bob proceed to use information reconciliation and privacy amplification techniques to create some number of shared secret keys. Otherwise, they cancel and start over. 

[Quantum Key Distribution on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution)

&gt; To check for the presence of an eavesdropper, Alice and Bob now compare a predetermined subset of their remaining bit strings. If a third party (usually referred to as Eve, for ""eavesdropper"") has gained any information about the photons' polarization, this introduces errors in Bob's measurements. Other environmental conditions can cause errors in a similar fashion. If more than p bits differ they abort the key and try again, possibly with a different quantum channel, as the security of the key cannot be guaranteed. p is chosen so that if the number of bits known to Eve is less than this, privacy amplification can be used to reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrarily small amount at the cost of reducing the length of the key. 

[This quantum cryptography paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.2507.pdf)

&gt;Alice and Bob compute the error rate of the test events (i.e., the fraction of data for which their value disagree). If the computed error rate is larger than some prescribed threshold value, say 11%, they abort. Otherwise, they proceed to the next step 

[This quantum key distribution paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315644447_A_Simulation_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Scheme_Using_C_Windows_Form_App)

&gt; If they disagree by more than a tiny percentage (that could be attributed to noise), they know that Eve was listening in and then sending  what  she  received.  In  that  case,  they  scratch  the  whole  sequence and try something else.",1600629176,QuantumComputing,DeadInsideOutside,Quantum,Comment,443
3550,"Yes, this lies at the very core of why quantum encryption is safe.

Let's use poper terminology for the BB84 states, encoded in photon polarization: |H&gt;, |V&gt;, |D&gt;=(|H&gt;+|V&gt;)/sqrt(2), |A&gt;=(|H&gt;-|V&gt;)/sqrt(2) for respectively horizontal, vertical, diagonal and anti-diagonal polarization.

You are correct about the first part of the BB84 protocol: Alice sends random bits (0 for |H&gt; and |D&gt;, 1 for |V&gt; and |A&gt;) in random basis (H/V or A/D), and Bob measures in a random basis. Thus, if no errors occur, *only* when Alice and Bob select the same basis do they get the same bit. Otherwise they get a random bit.

An eavesdropper can definitely accidentally change the polarization of the photon. This is why, after a round of QKD, Alice and Bob take a *subset* of their bit strings (after basis sifting) and *compare* (publicly) to check for errors. If the error rate is deemed too high (this is another topic entirely), they conclude the key could have been compromised, throw away the whole key, and start over.

If the error rate is low enough, they use the rest of their bits (the ones they didn't compare) for key.",1600628674,QuantumComputing,QuantumQuack0,Quantum,Comment,190

3561,"I know Zach Weinersmith does these kind of explanatory comics a lot, and often hes quite good at it. But if I may offer some constructive criticism, I think this one misses the mark.

If you try to separate the ""comedic"" and ""informational"" parts of this comic, I think the core information occurs in these 3 panels:

&gt;In quantum computing, the whole idea is just to choreograph a pattern of interference where the paths leading to each wrong answer interfere destructively and cancel out, while the paths leading to the right answer reinforce each other

&gt;And THAT gives your computer a huge speed boost!

&gt;Well, we only know how to do that for a few special problems.

&gt;The important thing for you to understand is that quantum computing isn't just a matter of trying all the answers in parallel.

The part I disagree with isn't the explanation, it's the statement of what ""the important thing for you to understand is"". Because to me, the important thing to understand is ""How would these quantum superpositions help with computation?"".

This kid says ""and THAT gives your computer a huge speed boost"" as if that's somehow immediately apparent from the idea of interference, but it's not. I doubt anyone who doesn't already know the specifics of QC would be able to walk away from that discussion able to explain why a quantum computer is useful in their own words. This causes the explanation to sound less like someone who wants to help another person understand a topic better and more like someone who wants another person to understand that they are wrong and don't know what they're talking about. To improve this, you would need to expand on this new concept in such a way that it's clear why this complex number encoded information can process information more quickly than classical information.

I also think this comic occasionally falls into a common trap that well educated people do of throwing in jargon because *they* know it's relevant, but it's too complicated to explain so they don't. This is unhelpful because when you are already familiar with the term it seems like a casual aside, but when youre not familiar it ends up being a confusing distraction that makes the overall message harder to parse. To someone unfamiliar when they see that new term they're not sure if it matters if they understand it or not, and so they have to pause and try to figure out whether or not it matters that they don't know that term.

An example here is: ""You should think of it as a new ontological category: A way of combining things that doesnt really map onto any classical concept"". Which is to say, this is a term I can't explain well with an analogy, so I wont. He doesn't even use the term ontological category after this panel, so it seems unnecessary and distracting to throw that in.

Finally, and this one I'm not really clear on so I could be way off, but I'm not sure if this explanation is really useful or correct with regards to Adiabatic Quantum Computing. I know computer scientists don't really like discussing this as much as Gate quantum computing, but it is still a thing. And from what I've been told, Adiabatic QC is where you encode the problem into the Hamiltonian of a qubit somehow, and then just let it settle to the lowest energy state. Which kind of *does* line up with the ""Just try all the possibilities in parallel"" metaphor, unless I'm missing something. 

Anyway, point is I think the joke part of this comic works fine, but the sciencey explanation part could be improved.",1600609160,QuantumComputing,Bananawamajama,Quantum,Comment,617

The Bloch Sphere is a neat educational tool to understand the dynamics of a qubit. But only one qubit. It is not possible to visualize the state of two or more qubits in a bloch sphere as the dimension of the state is too large (A pure two qubit state needs four basis states to be uniquily described for example |00&gt;,|10&gt;,|01&gt;,|11&gt;).

Also your single qubit encoding as it's shown there only depends on one variable 'x' which isn't enough to fix a position on a sphere. You only have the amplitude part of the qubit, what you are missing is the *phase* which is often written as cos(x)|0&gt; + exp(i*y)*sin(x)|1&gt;

3653,"Oh yeah, sorry.  The red and blue sidebands are ""faster"" the more motional energy you have in the chain, and their speed goes as sqrt(n), where n is the number of quanta of motion.  The red sideband on a single ion joins states |g,n&gt; and |e,n-1&gt;, and the blue sideband joins states |g,n&gt; and |e,n+1&gt;.  If I apply one of them continuously, the population will ""flop"" between the two coupled states, with a certain frequency.  The red sideband on |g,n&gt; is sqrt(n) times faster than the red sideband on |g,1&gt;, and the blue sideband on |g,n&gt; is sqrt(n+1) times faster than the blue sideband on |g,0&gt;, and that's what I meant by the ""strength"".  Off the top of my head I can't think of a nice intuitive explanation for why things are like that, but it falls quite simply out of the solution to the quantum harmonic oscillator.

To say the same thing in the operator formalism: In operators, the red sideband is like ""σ^(+)a + h.c"", where σ^+ is the ion excitation operator (maps |g&gt; to |e&gt; and |e&gt; to 0), a is the harmonic oscillator (e.g. the motion in an ion trap) annihilation operator, and `h.c.` means Hermitian conjugate (basically the reverse process).  The annihilation operator acts on harmonic oscillator states as 

    a|n&gt; = sqrt(n)|n - 1&gt;

so when we solve the Schrödinger equation, we find that the red sideband causes ""Rabi flopping"" (means the population moves coherently between the two as a sine wave) between |g,n&gt; and |e,n-1&gt; at a frequency proportional to sqrt(n).

Now the second question, ""does it work if everything is in the ground state?"": yes, it all works out fine, but good observation.  You're correct to point out the process which excites the red sideband ""first"" can't happen when starting from |gg,0&gt; because there's no red sideband from there, but the other one (blue sideband ""first"") still can, because it its intermediary virtual level is (|eg,1&gt;+|ge,1&gt;), which then _does_ have a red sideband available from it.  There's no path difference cancellation, but it doesn't matter because `n` in this case is 0, so we don't need to cancel it off.

You can make a similar argument to show why the gate works starting from |ee,0&gt; (everything's just backwards), and |ge,n&gt; or |eg,n&gt; (these are slightly different because they use two of the same colour photon, but the path difference and speed calculations are the same).


_edit_: I will also say that this is generally an intuitive view of things, and it's rather hand-wavy.

3654,"What is your question? Like can you restate it? I'll try to write something for you.

The ions move collectively because... well they are ions and they interact through the coulomb force. This is used as the ""data bus"".

Also their movement is not randomly, there are N modes of movement of ions along your main axis (lets say z-axis here), where N is the number of ions you have trapped. The movement along x and y can be ignored if you create a good trap, its very small oscillations.

Yes you want to cool the movement of your ions down fairly low to ground level for the Mølmer–Sørensen gate, or similiar gates since higher motional modes result in less perfect control because some of the approximations you make require very low motional modes.

3658,"Roughly, the MS interaction is a two-qubit flip whose speed is not dependent on the shared motional state. Perhaps the most used form of the gate maps |gg&gt; to (|gg&gt; + |ee&gt;) up to some relative phase difference (you can control it), and the ions have to be cool, but not completely 0 motion.

The hand-wavy intuition is that we simultaneous apply a laser tuned to  
      w_1 = w_z - w_m + d  
(slightly detuned from the red sideband) and  
      w_2 = w_z + w_m - d  
(oppositely detuned from the blue sideband), where w_z is the frequency of the |g&gt;--|e&gt; transition (the carrier), and w_m is the frequency of the |0&gt;--|1&gt; transition (the motional frequency).  d is a little bit extra detuning so that we're not directly addressing the transition to another motional level, and there's a little bit of phase advancement.  Because we haven't directly tuned to a sideband, there's no way^(*) that you can excite only a single ion; you have to excite both of them at once.  The total energy imparted if the chain absorbs one of each photon is exactly the right amount to get you from |gg&gt; to |ee&gt; (or back), so we've got the oscillations we wanted, using the motional state to get them to talk to each other.

The possible problem is that in order to be useful, the gate has to work at the same speed, no matter what motional state the chain is in.  If it didn't, then if the motion wasn't perfectly prepared, you'd get a mix of speeds needed depending on the state of the motion which probably isn't in a pure state, and the whole thing wouldn't work.

Let's say the ions start in the motional state |n&gt;.  The maths shakes out that the red sideband acting on |n&gt; has a strength ~sqrt(n), and the blue sideband has a strength ~sqrt(n+1).  There are two options for how  the process might work from here:

  1. the red goes ""first"" taking the state to |n-1&gt;, then the blue takes it back to |n&gt;
  2. the blue goes ""first"" taking the state to |n+1&gt;, then the red takes it back to |n&gt;

In version 1, the total strength goes as sqrt(n)\*sqrt(n-1 + 1) = n (i.e. red on |n&gt; has strength sqrt(n), then blue on |n-1&gt; has strength n), and in version 2 the total strength goes as sqrt(n + 1)\*sqrt(n+1) = n + 1.  Very very hand-wavily, you can think of a phase difference between versions 1 and 2, so instead of adding them to get the total strength of the process, they actually subtract.  Now the speed is (n+1) - n = 1, or in other words, it's not dependent on the motion at all.

---

^(*): actually, for there to be truly no way, you'd have to have d be infinitely large, but then your lasers wouldn't be the right frequency.  In the original papers, they keep d much bigger than the strength of the laser they use, so the population that goes into those intermediate levels is very low, and oscillates out again quickly enough that on average, you still get decent fidelity.  The downside to this is that you have to do the gate very slowly.  In the modern way of doing things, we don't use perturbation theory, we solve the Schrödinger equation exactly, and it turns out that with a particular ratio of d to the strength of the drive, you can line up the ""motion returning to where it should be"" and the ""qubit--qubit pi/2 rotation"" so that they happen at the same time, and that makes your gate.

---

This description very roughly corresponds to Sørensen and Mølmer, _""Quantum Computation with Ions in Thermal Motion""_, PRL **82** 1971 (1999).  A little bit of a glossary between my terms and theirs:

me | them
----|----
w_z | w_{eg}
""strength"" | Rabi frequency (captial omega)
w_m | nu
d | delta - nu
e/g (ion state) | e/g
n | n

(the last two elements are just to indicate we use the same terminology)

They also refer to the ""Lamb--Dicke parameter"" (eta) which is a measure of how strongly the laser interacts with the motion.  To make the gate motion-independent, you need eta\*sqrt(n + 1) to be much much less than 1 for all relevant n otherwise the strengths of the sidebands don't go nicely as ~sqrt(n) any more, and the cancellation doesn't work.

They start off by imagining only one laser on each ion.  This works, but as they say later, it's better just to apply both to both ions and that's easier to do experimentally too.

They also talk about interaction with a thermal reservoir.  You don't really need to understand this to understand the gate at an intuitive level, but they're showing that it works even if the motion changes over the course of the gate within reason.",1600092220,QuantumComputing,lishyguy,Quantum,Comment,817

3661,"&gt; Well, quantum computing is absolutely reversible on paper if we discount measurement. 
&gt; Any complaint about irreversibility is a complaint about practical considerations or about measurement.

That's probably the crux of my argument. You can't have quantum computing without the final measurements.

&gt; When you talk about energy used to construct a state space, you probably mean that the energy is used to lower the temperature to near absolute zero so that the initial state of the quantum computer is nearly pure. Doing quantum operations might raise the temperature, but they might not. 

I meant the energy used to do quantum operations. The cooling I freely agree it's a fixed cost and hence discounted.

I also accept that while quantum operations take energy, those energy is not to be lost before measurement.

Basically my argument rest on two claims:

_ Destructive measurements are not optional in quantum computing if you want a speedup. Otherwise you have no useful output.

_ Measurements are not fixed cost to tag on at the end. This because most energy invested into executing quantum gates/operations is to entangle and build a wavefunction which lives in a larger and larger phase/state space. When you collapse this at the end by the measurement you erase all of this large state space to get your useful output. The thermal cost of this step scales with the length of circuit sequence. The larger the state space the more you will have erased at the end.

I don't think you and I are too far apart at this point. Maybe you are using a more general definition of quantum computing, one with less emphasis on restricting its use to the problems that would have a quantum speedup. If you use quantum computer ONLY like a classical computer, which you can, then I think we are on the same page.

Now that I understood the core idea a bit more, I think that quantum computing is not reversible even on paper.

It's easy to see that all gates in an idealized QC are ""frictionless"" (indeed in a superconducting implementation, all you see in the circuit are L and C and never R).  So it's still reasonable to say that all energy is conserved until the end. 

However, I claim, because all of this energy is used to construct the state space of the entangled circuit and the final  measurements at the end neccesarily collasp this whole state space, it uses up ALL the energy that is provided thus far to run the sequence. You cannot recirculate this energy for the next run. Every sequence that any qubits is subjected to will end with a measurement. There is no useful resource left at the end.

3669,"I'm no expert, but I'll try to clarify
Some energy levels are used as the qubit states. These energy levels are coupled (influenced) by the motional mode (movement of the ion), so if it's moving, the energy difference for the states 1/0 would be different to when still. This kinda gives an intuition to how we can go about coupling multiple qubits.

Ion traps work by 'trapping' ions in a oscillating potential well. Think of a saddle rotating so that the ions stay almost still. Then you can address the energy levels using appropriate lasers.
Also they are 'ions' so each ion can also repel and hence influence other ion movement, hence their energy level.

Now putting it together, motion of ions can be induced by certain lasers. Then different wavelength lasers can be used to address qubits that are moving due to repulsion. Since motion is in actual space, they almost to a good accuracy influence every other ion in that trap, so coupling by additional excitations to any other ion in the trap after inducing motion in one of the ion, and then reversing the first action of causing ion motion. Thus ions are quite well connected.

Think of a Newton's craddle like setup, so once you set off motion in one ion, then do something on someother ion (which is dependent on that particular motional mode of the ion) and then reverse the original cause of the motion and hence you'd have performed coupled gate. Now the catch is during motion, you may influence other ions too, so it's very 'well connected'.

Edit: I might have confused you, but trust me the mechanism is quite beautiful. Try looking up some YouTube videos or any simple books.

Tl;dr:
1) motion is restricted but possible. Also motion influences energy levels
2) motion also influences most other ions in the trap due to repulsion
3) hence well connected as I can set off motion in one place, act on other places, reset motion.",1600005316,QuantumComputing,praveen91299,Quantum,Comment,333

Quantum computing is probably more computationally efficient than the irreversible sort, but is not necessarily more energy efficient. The point is that computational efficiency and energy efficiency are very different concepts.

It is true that computational efficiency should, all else being equal, lead to greater energy efficiency. But it is not true that greater energy efficiency implies, all else being equal, improved computational efficiency.

To study computational efficiency, we need a few metrics of computational cost (as opposed to energy cost). To pick a few important ones: time, space, size. Roughly speaking, time complexity means the number of gates that must be executed in a row, space complexity means the number of bits that need to be involved at any one time in the computation, and size means the total number of operations performed (upper bounded by time \* space). Energy cost might relate to each of these metrics (or other ones) in complicated and not necessarily desirable ways, but the trade-off could be worth it if we are saving with respect to another metric. For example, it might we worth paying more energy for improved time complexity and a quantum computer might provide exactly this tradeoff for some kinds of problems.",1599959740,QuantumComputing,YuvalRishu,Quantum,Comment,219

3677,"Sure. It's a bit complicated and I have to keep it a bit brief because I'm working on other stuff right now. But here goes.

There is an old physics thought experiment called Maxwell's Daemon. In that thought experiment, we imagine a box filled with an ideal gas with a wall partitioning the box into two equal sizes. In that wall is a door that can be opened or closed. There is also a daemon (Greek for spirit, not the evil kind that the English word connotes) in the box that can watch for gas particles and can open or close the door. The gas in the two sides of the box have an initially equal temperature.

The experiment/paradox is this. The daemon can watch for gas particles and choose to open or close the door based on the speed of the particle. So the daemon can let faster particles into one side of the box and slower particles into the other. As a result, the daemon introduces a temperature difference between the sides of the box over time, apparently without an energy cost. This violates the second law of thermodynamics.

The resolution is something called Landauer's principle (same Landauer I mentioned in another post). Landauer pointed out that the daemon has to remember whether or not she should open the door. This is a bit of information. If the daemon has finite memory, then eventually the daemon has to erase bits of memory to make room for new memory. There is an intrinsic energy cost to bit erasure, so the second law of thermodynamics is not violated after all.

The implication for computation that Landauer himself drew is that there appears to be a fundamental energy cost to computation. But the reversible computing arguments of Charlie Bennett and others showed that, in fact, one need not erase information in order to perform Turing-complete computation. Thus the cost of computation could in principle be brought to zero, although in practice one needs to correct errors. I mentioned in another post that one implication of fault-tolerance threshold theorems is that the energy cost of error correction in principle scales much more slowly than the energy cost of irreversible computation, so it looks like there's a considerable energy savings to be had if we can get the technology right.

I understand that classical circuits can be modeled in a similar way but the difference is in the measurement operation which, in the classical case is performed at every step of the computation, as it were, while QC permits us to "" defer"" the measurement step to the end of the circuit so that we can realistically exploit that exponential state space.

3687,"Ok, I have time for a proper response. Sorry if my previous response was a bit glib. I was in the middle of breakfast and using my tablet. I've switched to my laptop and have the time to write something more thorough.

Your objection is a good one, and has been tried by very prominent scientists (notably Rolf Landauer). If we develop the objection a bit further, we arrive at something like the following. It may be possible in a perfectly noiseless world to do reversible computing, but because of the need to counteract noise we will need to augment the computation with operations intended to counteract the effect of noise. Correcting noise is necessarily irreversible, because the result should be the same no matter the kind of noise. So wouldn't we have to add a lot of irreversible operations, thereby eliminating any efficiency gains?

~~The answer is yes, but it's not that many operations.~~ 
*Edited to clarify:* The answer is no. Whereas we do have to add irreversible operations, it isn't enough to wipe out efficiency gains.

Versions of this objection were raised to quantum computing and to the regular kind of computing. The response comes in the form of what are called ""fault-tolerance threshold theorems"". These theorems prove that, if noise is reasonably well behaved and introduces errors at a low enough rate, then any computation can be augmented to protect against those errors with only a polylogarithmic overhead. That is to say, the ratio of the size of the augmented (""fault-tolerant"") computation to the size of the non-augmented computation only grows as a polynomial function of the logarithm of the size of the non-augmented computation. ~~This ratio becomes vanishingly small as computations become extremely large, so the efficiency gains can be preserved so long as the noise is kept reasonably low.~~

*Edited to add:* Sorry, that last sentence is a misstatement. What I mean to say is that we find the energy cost of reversible computing (and related metrics for other kinds of computing) grows only slowly with the size of the computation. Naïvely we expect that the cost should grow directly with the size of the computation, but in fact it only grows as a polylogarithm, which is *much* slower!

These arguments were developed for the usual model of computing in the 1950s (John von Neumann) and for quantum computing in the late 1990s (various people). I don't think it's ever been specifically nailed down for reversible computing but that's only because it hasn't been a priority. No one doubts that similar theorems could be expressed for the reversible model too. It's a project I might tackle myself in a few years when I have a permanent academic position (I'm still a postdoc).

Yes, web search (and many other kinds of search) use ""tricks"" like shingling, min-hash, and so on. But that's not really my point. My point is that *search is important* -- that's why all those tricks were developed in the first place!

&gt; Moreover, how often do normal computer users have to execute a blind search?

I think it was Knuth who said something along the lines that all computational problems can be reduced to some variant of search or sort, or combinations thereof. Most of what your computer is doing when it is not idling is some kind of search or sort.

Which is linear algebra. Which is what QC does incomparably better than digital computers can.

&gt; But those are all just linear ""update everything"" tasks. Looking at the current state of the theory I see absolutely no reason for consumer PCs to include a dedicated quantum computing unit.

Given the current state of QC hardware, there is no foreseeable path to QC as a personal computing technology, not even as an expansion card. You just can't shrink a refrigerator that can get within a fraction of a Kelvin to absolute zero down that small. However, there is the possibility of novel QC hardware based on ""hot"" qubits, or even room-temperature QC with hardware based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, and so on.

&gt; The comparison to radio seems inaccurate since quantum computers are hardly just analog computers.

I wasn't comparing quantum and analog, I was comparing digital to analog to point out that digital is very far from power-optimal in respect to what is physically possible. The fact that analog can perform computational tasks at power-profiles orders of magnitude below digital demonstrates the power inefficiency of digital on those problem domains. Digital gives you *flexibility* at the cost of power-efficiency. Analog gives you power-efficiency, at the cost of flexibility.

&gt; Current suggestions are to simulate one logical qubit with hundreds or thousands of error corrected physical qubits. Getting qubit implementations anywhere close to the efficiency of bit registers seems like a complete pipe dream to me.

I don't disagree that there are a lot of highly unrealistic expectations in QC space right now. Even more, I think that we are bumping against some kind of hitherto unknown ""conservation of computational effort"" law[1]... I don't think that Nature gives you ""computation for free"" just because you put your computer in a big refrigerator and isolated it from EM interference. So I think the ""classical vs. quantum"" divide which, today, is treated as a bright-line distinction is going to become increasingly blurred in the future. I predict that we will build classical computers that act more and more like quantum computers, and vice-versa. So what we are really optimizing is ""compute-per-resource"", regardless of whether that resource is a delicate quantum state or a robust classical state. Along the way, my hope is that our understanding of the exact relationship between classical information processing systems and quantum information processing systems becomes clearer and less cloaked in mysticism (yes, I am including even the physicists in this critique because of the stubborn insistence that ""quantum cannot be understood"").

[1] - I mean something more general than Landauer's principle which tells us how much entropy there is in irreversible operations. Because we live in a quantum universe, digital computers are actually quantum computers (as is everything else)... so we can regard a digital computer as a very poor/inefficient quantum computer. The fact that some operations can be performed more efficiently on a ""pure"" quantum computer doesn't automatically prove that a quantum computer can perform all computational tasks more efficiently than a digital computer. So, there must be some criterion embedded into the structure of physics itself that determines which problems can be solved very efficiently and which problems cannot. When you're solving one of these ""hard problems"" that even a pure QC could not solve more efficiently than a classical computer, it won't matter how you physically implement the solution, you will just run into the same limitation in some other physical form.

3720,"

&gt; However, I have read that Quantum Computers will only be good for any/only problems that can be ""translated into a quantum mechanical interference pattern"". Considering the double-slit pattern, I kind of consider this to roughly mean ""can this problem be calculated using nothing but Sin waves?""

By the analogy of GPU, you won't expect GPU is useful only when the entire problem can be calculated using nothing but vector operations. If part of the entire algorithm can be accelerated, then this can help to solve many other problems by using quantum algorithms as subroutines.

For example, only parts from Shor's algorithm use quantum computing. Of course you can also consider other parts as ""translating to QC"". In that sense, it's not as trivial to see how QC can be useful for a given problem as GPU can be.

&gt; even I smartest amongst us aren't sure which problems will can and cannot be translated into the mathematics of the quantum world yet (from my understanding).

A problem can be solved efficiently by QC if it's in the class of [BQP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP). So any problem that belongs to a lower complexity class can be automatically solved by QC.

The interesting open question is whether a hard problem for classical computers can be solved efficiently by QC. It's generally a hard task to find the lower boundary of complexity. The problem not specific to QC.

There are basically no general solutions, but individual proofs. That is, if you construct an efficient algorithm, then it serves as a proof. This is hardly helpful if the end goal itself is to design an algorithm.",1599885906,QuantumComputing,crvdgc,Quantum,Comment,270
3721,"So, there's a pretty big disconnect between the popular discussion surrounding QC and the reality of QC. While quantum physics is, obviously, counterintuitive, QC is not as exotic as the press makes it out to be. The reason is that, in QC, we don't necessarily care about everything quantum (as the physicists do). Rather, we constrain our view of the quantum world to the qubit and, in this way, we allow ourselves to ignore all the other quantum weirdness that doesn't help us compute. To be sure, all the quantum weirdness is still there, it's just that we don't have to care about it unless we utilize it in some way. So this is why QC will be very efficient at simulating quantum physics (with all its weirdness) and, yet, we can build a relatively clean QC abstraction that - compared to the weirdness of quantum physics - is almost boring.

The classical computer is built on a simple abstraction: the ideal switch. You can think of the transistor as being a switch or valve that is either completely ON or completely OFF. Ideally, there is no linear (analog) component in the operation of a digital logic circuit. Of course, the reality is that there are imperfections in real digital logic circuits and they do not perfectly approximate ideal switches. But the goal is to approximate ideal switches as closely as possible and that's exactly what digital electronics circuits do.

Similarly, the simple abstraction that underlies a quantum computer is *an ideal complex matrix multiplier*. By ""ideal"", we mean that it makes no errors (never decoheres). There is no mystery to complex matrix multiplication, it's just a bunch of additions and multiplies. GPUs are ideal for simulating quantum circuits for this reason (at least, as ideal as any digital system can be). A quantum circuit is ""assembled"" down to a sequence of such multiplications. And it is these multiplications that form the universal operation of the qubits themselves.

It is absolutely possible to convert any digital logic circuit into a sequence of matrix multiplications and even to carry this out on a quantum computer. It's just very inefficient by comparison to native operation of a digital circuit. So, even in a future where QC has become widespread, problems that are ""natively Boolean"" will still tend to be solved using standard digital circuits, while other problems that can be converted into some efficient expression in linear algebra[1] will be solved using the vast power of QC.

For example, we probably don't want to use quantum computers to process bank ledgers because QC is highly susceptible to noise. And ""the power of superposition"" is not really a power when it comes to keeping accounts *separate*. In any case, digital computers already perform these kinds of tasks at lightning speed, there's really no bottleneck here. The only shortcoming left is power consumption. But then it's a question of who has the lower noise-margin for a given power-profile -- QC or digital. It's not at all obvious that QC wins that battle. So, even in a QC-dominated world, we may still use digital computers for tasks that require high security and extremely low noise even if they use more power (banking, encryption, and so on).

[1] -- It's difficult to define a problem that *doesn't* have an efficient expression in linear algebra because it is so general (we can express any logic circuit as a sequence of operations in linear algebra). Intuitively, it seems to me that book-keeping like tasks (OS, office software, emails) will tend to be the last things converted to quantum, while the tasks that are hard for digital computers but very valuable to us (physics simulations, scientific computing, machine learning, VR, rendering, game physics, etc.) will be the first things to be converted to quantum.",1599885710,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,635

3724,"A QPU would be an add on and not a replacement of CPU or GPU.

The interference of a probability wave with negative values is one resource that a QPU has but others don't, so you are not all wrong in thinking that. But it's much more than sine waves since if that's the case you can build a computer that is basically cavities which host different vibrational modes like a laser cavity or a string under tension. This kind of analogue computing does not lead to a speed up yet, even though it can encode info in wave modes and superposition them.

This is because the other crucial resource that a quantum computer has is entanglement. Specifically the fact that the actions are non-local and the wavefunction evolves unitarily. This phenomena is unique in nature and any advantages are strongly suspected to have to come from these features.

This is why it's not good enough that you have a lot of qubits. The amount entanglement gate between any two qubits on a chip need to be maximized as well, basically its interconnectivity.",1599868955,QuantumComputing,Vrochi,Quantum,Comment,183
3725,"There are attacks that aim at the hardware layer in a physical implementation of QKD.

It does not necessarily mean targeting a poorly built buggy hardware because nothing in real life is perfect. It means to target the inherent weakness in the technology and the device physics of perfectly built components themselves.

For example, you need a single photon detector in QKD. There are only a few ways to build such a sensor, avalanche diode, superconducting wire etc. Say you use a superconducting wire. The way the tech works is when a photon hits the wire it heats it up and reverts it to normal resistance. You deduce this event by checking the current through the wire. The wire needs to get cold again to detect the next photon. This time is finite and during which it won't click. An attacker could split the fiber in the middle and send pulses of bright light to the detector in a way that extend the downtime of the wire and make it not to click when it should. They can also blind it in a way that make it click where it shouldn't, effectively take control of the detector output without raising any suspicion. In reality, the scheme should be more complicated than this but you get the gist. The outcome is that sometime Eve can still get the quantum key without generating too many errors on Bob side.

The thing is fundamentally though that there is this popular picture of quantum computers as being new machine that will soon be in your office and you'll have to learn how it works... when really it's more like a new kind of transistor that's soldered on the motherboard. It'll silently do it's work. The people that need to understand how it work are at the manifacturer and how to use it, well, I am enormously unconvinced by the premise behind a lot of ""quantum programming"" these days that pretends like there is a huge bottleneck of people not knowing how to program quantum computers which we will need very soon!

When in reality what we ""need"" are mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists that can figure out what if any tasks can be made to benefit from QCs at all. There are tasks that we know QCs are cool for - simulation of real quantum physics phenomena chief among them. But there simply is no indication of a full ecosystem of ""quantum software"" that will need programmers like regular software on the horizon. It'll probably always remain a comparatively small field of highly trained experts.

This is because what we know they can do, for the most part, is simply not as sexy as a lot of people want to think. (For example, although fault-tolerant quantum computers with enough qubits can crack RSA encryption, there are several quantum-resistant cryptosystem candidates. Scott Aaronson and probably several others believe perhsps one of the first real applications will simply be solving chemistry problems that are difficult to simulate classically. I could imagine an interesting movie about quantumcomputers, for example, discovering room temperature superconductors or a more efficient process than Haber Bosch. But I haven't seen one yet, and I imagine several people would find that movie uninteresting without some other elements thrown in.)

3813,"Quantum encryption doesn’t rely on hard math problems like classical encryption.   Instead it relies on quirks of physics, in particular regarding a pair of entangled Qubits.


To have quantum encryption, both parties need to have a qubit, and those qubits need to be entangled with each other.  Then person A measures their qubit, and sends a classical bit based on the result and the bit they want to send.  Person B takes the classical bit, makes a measurement based on it, and is able to recover the bit Person A wanted to send.  No one who intercepts the data can read the hidden bit because they don’t have a qubit entangled with Person A’s qubit.


&gt;	Quantum encryption does not rely on quantum entanglement to communicate though because you can still send the encrypted sequences via standard means.

Part of the information is sent classically, but that information is essentially instructions for how to measure your qubits, which must be entangled with the sender’s qubits.


&gt;	Furthermore, you cannot have cryptography without computation,

Not particularly?  Modern classical cryptography definitely requires some rudimentary math, but quantum cryptography doesn’t really require anything I’d describe as “computation”, and neither does many old-fashioned techniques, like a cipher wheel.  Furthermore, you could absolutely build a device that is capable of cryptography but absolutely not capable of any more classical computation (not Turing complete).

1. Some (but NOT ALL) problems can specifically be solved faster with a QC than with a CC. Any intro textbook will go through the canonical quantum algorithms in order but Deutch Jozsa,  Bernstein Vazrani, Simon's, Shors (which actually can't be done on a classical computer), etc. 
2. The quantum advantage comes from the possibility of superposition. A lot of the time the question isn't, ""How is one qubit one better than a classical bit?""  Rather, ""Instead of using N bits to solve this problem how can I use significantly less (say M) qubits to solve it?""
3. As far as ""don't you need to measure a qubit to use it?"", yes you absolutely do. But in the intermediary steps the higher dimensionality of the system allows you to more conveniently manipulate the state than if it was a classical system. Usually the goal is to very cleverly get the state to have probability 1 of being measured in 0 (or 1) and probability 0 of something else.",1599578252,QuantumComputing,indiankid96,Quantum,Comment,186

3873,"Yep, it's a vector. 

The state of a quantum mechanical system with N levels is a N-dimensional complex vector (an element of a N-dimensional Hilbert space). Measurement yields an outcome with a probability given by the projection of this vector onto a basis of at most N outcomes (these can be thought of as axes in 3d space). 

What makes QM special is that a system composed of two smaller subsystems has a number of states that correspond to the product of the two subsystems, AND that the the system can exist in a non separable state (entanglement). 

So for instance 3 qubits has 2*2*2 or eight states (same as 3 normal bits). Importantly the overall state can be a non separable sum of any of those eight states, which makes measurements correlated, and allow more information to be stored or processed than in a classical non probabilistic system.",1599563818,QuantumComputing,xmcqdpt2,Quantum,Comment,149

3878,"So a couple things, the qubit’s state is not actually indeterminate before you measure, the qubit actually has a defined state at any point.

Think of a 2D axis like you would see on graph paper, we’ll call a ray pointing directly towards your right 0, and a ray pointing directly left 1. Regular computing allows you to have a ray (or state) point rightwards or leftwards aka 0 and 1, while quantum computation allows you to have a ray that is pointing in any direction between right and left (for eg. a ray representing a qubit can point straight up and be equal parts 0 and 1). 

These are states that are some part right and some part left. Say a ray at 45 degree angle would be more parts right than left. This would represent a state in an unequal superposition of 0 and 1. An equal superposition where it is exactly the same amount of both states would be a ray pointing straight up.

This is computationally useful because you can now represent a lot more information in a 2 qubit system than you could in a 2 bit system. These ‘intermediate’ systems (between 0 and 1) will when evaluated come out to be EITHER 0 or 1 every time, but when computation and measurement are repeated they mean of your final measurements start approaching the proportionality of how far your final state is between 0 and 1, which is the ‘true’ position of the final qubit state. So for a equal superposition of 0 and 1, the expectation (average) of you measurements should approach 0.5.",1599548658,QuantumComputing,IcyBaba,Quantum,Comment,269

3887,"So, for unstructured search, you can theoretically get a quadratic speedup O(√N) over classical search O(N). Unstructured search is *very* general and you can cast most computational problems into some sort of search problem (though doing so naïvely would fail to exploit the structure of the problem, which is generally inadvisable if it's there). Nevertheless, there is a very general speedup – the trouble is, the nature of that kind of speedup doesn't leave much room for overhead in preparing quantum states and sampling the outputs.

Some people have mentioned that entanglement and superpositions are the source of the speedup. Sorta. But the other key component is quantum interference. Roughly, the goal of any quantum algorithm targeting a universal quantum computer is to essentially model a large Hilbert space of possible solutions (entanglement, superposition) and orchestrate quantum interference over the superposition such that the solutions you want are subject to constructive interference and the non-solutions to destructive interference. That way, when you sample the output state, the probability of the correct solution is increased. Do many shots, and you'll build your statistical confidence in the correct solution. 

I bring this up because entanglement is easy (e.g. CNOT gate on two qubits entangles them). Superposition is easy (e.g. Hadamard gate on n qubits). Orchestrating the interference to perform a computation? Much, much harder. You essentially have to devise a mathematical function (encoded as some unitary) in a polynomial (or less) number of gates that is able to generate the require quantum interference on an *exponentially* large Hilbert space. The problems that allow you to do this tend to have special properties. If you want to read some of the literature on attempts to understand the characteristics of problems that quantum computers can solve exponentially faster, see work by Scott Aaronson, Andris Ambainis, and Shalev Ben-David. I can find the papers if you're interested.",1599460025,QuantumComputing,Abstract-Abacus,Quantum,Comment,312

3894,"There isn't anything ""magic"" about qubits that makes them ""like classical bits but faster.""  The speed comes from the fact quantum programs use a fundamentally different way of manipulating data.

Classical computers are good for most practical applications because they manipulate information in the most basic, intuitive way- through bitwise and predicate logic.  A and B, C or D, if X is Y, etc.  We can interpret, compare and contrast units of information as we please and act accordingly.

The logic of quantum algorithms is different.  Instead of predicate logic, it's based in linear algebra, which is useful for showing how all possible states are changed under a series of operations in a uniform way.  For instance, linear algebra may be used in 3d video games when you want to translate from the coordinate system of the game world to the coordinate system of the pixels on your screen.  But as a classical system, we have to process those calculations one by one, vertex by vertex, pixel by pixel.  For every input, give me an output.  What makes qubits special is that by leveraging their apparent randomness, we can abstract the input and output states to the point that we can virtually take them out of the picture.  What quantum computers are great at is showing us the relationship between them.

For instance, let's say we had a standard combination lock with 60 positions that, from the initial state, must be turned clockwise to another state and then counterclockwise to a final state to be opened.  A classical computer would have to run through these one by one.  1-2-1, 1-2-3, 1-2-4, etc.  In the worst case, that's 60\*59\*59, or over 200,000 operations.  With a quantum computer, you don't have to try each operation, because it doesn't care where you ""start"", what only matters is how far one turn is from the other.  Let's have 50, 30 left, 40 right as our example solution. After the first try, we don't know the exact combination, but we see a larger likelihood of opening the locker if the last step is a turn of 10 to the right.  So we amplify  (i.e. ""boil down to"") the outcomes where the last step is turning 10 to the right. Next we see a larger likelihood of the correct result where the second step is turning 20 to the left.  Now we know the result is X - (X-20) left - (X-20+10) right.  Now it's just a matter of finding X the same way and voila.  We've reduced 60\^3 operations to 3.  But the thing to note is that we didn't do it by running through each case really, really fast, we did it by abstracting the unique cases as transformations demonstrating a relationship between an arbitrary input state and an arbitrary output states, to the point that a single solution was inevitable.  That's something you can only do efficiently with a quantum computer because of entanglement.

But this isn't useful for every type of problem, both from a practical and a physical point of view.  For starters, not everything you do with a computer comes down to searching through a vast space of potential states.  While though you could, in theory, perform any classical algorithm on a quantum computer by restricting yourself to non-quantum logic gates, you wouldn't be getting any advantage or speed up out of it. But even in a perfect world where a quantum computer was as cheap and universally efficient as a classical computer, there's no getting around the volatility of qubits. There's no advantage pure and simple to using them to store or represent concrete, structured data like a user profile or bitmap picture because whether a user measures them or a rogue cosmic ray hits the register, the data can't be accessed or copied without being destroyed.  Qubits are awesome, no doubt, but using them when bits would do isn't even killing a fly with a shotgun, it's just killing a fly with a million dollar swatter made of glass.",1599425645,QuantumComputing,SuperStingray,Quantum,Comment,671
3895,"Because the special tools of a (ideally fault-tolerant) quantum computer are **entanglement** and **superposition**. If you cannot exploit them in some way, you don't get any speedup, plain and simple.

At current times, there are only few tasks for which we are provably or reasonably sure that we can design a quantum algorithm that relies on superposition/entanglement to achieve a speedup. It has conversely been shown that in some other tasks there won't be any speedup from quantum computing.

The important point is: the few task currently known for QC to be a useful technology are so important that they already fully motivate the effort and cost in developing them :)",1599418152,QuantumComputing,Timber_Owl,Quantum,Comment,111

Also I've heard that we have probably about a decade left for growth similiar to what Moore's law states. What will likely be happening before we move onto another form of computing is that we use materials other than silicon for developing even smaller transistors or have better thermal performance allowing an increase of frequency. These could be materials like graphene, germanium, or molybdenum disulfide.

Scott Aaronson said that the best way to think about it is that it's a new and fundamentally different thing that's neither ""and"" nor ""or"" and which is best understood in terms of the mathematics behind it.

In practical terms the different states of the superposition inside a quantum computer don't allow you to do different tasks at the same time because in the end you have to measure the output state which means the computer has to be in a single well defined state at the end of the calculation. But the way it gets there to that state can be by interference of different superpositions of states which allows through some clever tricks to do certain calculations in much fewer steps then if you did them on a classical computer.",1599408466,QuantumComputing,ThirdMover,Quantum,Comment,166

3944,"&gt; Furthermore, I think Pennylane uses autograd, chainer, PyTorch, and other machine learning libraries as backend to compute the gradients and doesn't compute the gradients by itself.

In this case, PennyLane is doing two things:

* It implements the rules and logic for computing quantum gradients as /u/gawron has mentioned. That is, PennyLane calculates the gradient for a variational quantum circuit with respect to some measurement statistic (such as an observable expectation/variance, or the output probability distribution). PennyLane uses several approaches for computing the quantum gradient:

  - The [parameter-shift rule](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/parameter_shift.html) which computes the quantum gradient using repeated quantum circuit evaluations. The neat thing about this approach is that it is hardware compatible --- so the quantum gradients can be computed on quantum hardware, alongside the cost function value.

  - Standard backpropagation. Here, PennyLane will simply use classical backpropagation to compute quantum gradients. Compared to the parameter-shift rule, this only works on simulators. If using a simulator, however, [it can scale better than the parameter-shift rule](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_backprop.html).

  - Reversible backpropagation. This is a modified form of backpropagation, that is well suited for reversible/unitary computations (and as such requires less memory than regular backpropagation). As with backprop, it only work on simulators, not hardware.

  - Numeric differentiation/finite-differences. This is a fallback mode, that is universal (works everywhere), but numerically unstable :)

* Secondly, PennyLane provides the ability to backpropagate through a *hybrid* classical-quantum model. It does this by registering the quantum gradients with PyTorch/Autograd/TensorFlow, in effect, making it so that you can include quantum components within a standard PyTorch/Autograd/TensorFlow model. The classical ML framework performs the overall backpropagation --- whenever a quantum component is encountered, it 'hands over' to PennyLane to compute the quantum gradients.",1599191551,QuantumComputing,___J,Quantum,Comment,282

I haven't seen any research groups go down this path. Measurement based QC requires the ability to generate large entangled networks of qubits which isn't currently possible for quantum dot based devices. Current state of the art is ~10 dots but on devices that large the experiments are comparatively simple and entanglement has not been generated across the entire array (e.g. [single electron shuttling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08970-z)).

In the context of quantum simulation, there is some work on using quantum dots as a platform to directly simulate interesting physics in a non-gate based approach (e.g. [this paper on Nagaoka ferromagnetism](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2051-0?proof=t)) but I would suggest this has not yet become a popular avenue in quantum dot research.",1599093085,QuantumComputing,Hypsochromic,Quantum,Comment,219

This is crucial; it means that we *don't* have to wait for quantum computers that are mature enough to implement them – after all, if NIST is testing these algorithms for standardization, how would they practically do that if they required a mature quantum computer? A common assumption of lattice based quantum resistant encryption is that [learning with errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_errors) is hard on average for a quantum computer.

""*Unfortunately, I assume a quantum-driven cybersecurity apocalypse is just over the horizon.*""

For now, it seems highly likely that a quantum computer sufficient to crack existing encryption will need to be very large by todays standards, which implies fault tolerance. There are certainly rapid advances towards fault tolerance, but even if we assume an exponential increase in qubit density akin to Moore's law (i.e. a doubling of qubit counts and the reduction of error rates to support them every 18 months), it would take 30 years to have a quantum computer of sufficient size to leverage Shor's algorithm to crack 2048 bit RSA. Here's [a paper with data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749) for a back of the envelope calculation. Of course, advances in algorithms, error correction, and hardware will likely make the day come much sooner (my guess is 10 - 15 years, 20 at best) and implementing a new encryption standard may take much of that time, but I would assert that providing this back of the envelope calculation is critical to your point, even if it is being published in Forbes. Otherwise, it's just fear mongering.",1599076091,QuantumComputing,Abstract-Abacus,Quantum,Comment,404

4012,"&gt; 1) Is it possible to simulate one atom as a whole or is the uncertainty of the electron too complex for just a few qubits to handle?

Depends on what you're trying to do. If you're simulating chemistry you definitely need to simulate an atom 'non-holistically' because the its electronic (i.e. quantum) configuration is what gives rise to chemistry.

&gt; 2) To simulate a hydrogen atom completely, do you think it would stress more on the physical lowering of quantum noise or to create a rigorous software algorithm to model an atom’s behavior?

I'm sorry could you rephrase this question, I don't know what you're asking.

&gt; 3) Will simulating each individual atom completely be overkill when trying to simulate a chemical reaction or can a program just make entities with properties of an atom without distinguishable nucleus and electron cloud?

Really depends on the type of simulation you're doing. Quantum simulation of chemistry is a big big field with many different techniques designed to simulate chemistry at different scales.

&gt; 4) Is the only way to reduce noise in a quantum system to create one million qubits that corrects noisy qubits, or is there alternatives to isolating atoms beside from cooling to absolute zero for an application in future quantum commercial computers?

This is several questions with several different answers. First, not all qubits require cooling (e.g. photonic qubits). In addition, I'll just say that extreme cryogenic cooling, while foreign to most people, is *not* really a significant limit to current quantum hardware. Second, future error correction methods might reduce the overhead required to construct a logical qubit. Third, it is a very very big field of research to improve the properties of individual qubits and quantum devices to reduce the number of physical qubits required to construct a logical qubit.",1599045718,QuantumComputing,Hypsochromic,Quantum,Comment,303

4040,"CPLEX and Gurobi most likely faster, but proprietary and potentially too expensive for our bootstrap startup.  Instead we custom-develop methods that are accurate, fast, intuitive, and relatively edgy.  We own them outright.  As a startup...this matters to be sustainable.

We have moved beyond the 'quantum vs. classical' competition that we started with.  No longer matters.  We can run 60 stocks at one time classically in 7 seconds, consistently.  We can do 64 assets still in under one minute.  This is with a 2013 iMAC with 16GB RAM...if we need more speed (vs. better code and cloud systems to access), we can use our in-house server, or buy a new MAC.  It is not about speed, but about the quality of the solutions in a reasonable timeframe.  At 64 assets, we can use both the 2k D-Wave and classical.  D-Wave still requires calibration and set-up, which we need to reduce next.   

Why does the competition end?  We max out the D-Wave at 64 assets (fully connected vertices, or cliques) using the 16x16x4 Chimera graph with 2,048 qubits.  So, the competition ends there, because we can run more than 64 stocks classically.  

The D-Wave is fast, especially as we begin to master the parameters and settings.  That takes time...we just successfully ran 2 new ways to embed the problem (Lazy Fixed, and Fixed Embedding). Been getting it right faster.

We welcome input from the financial services sector.  None have given us their proprietary stock picking codes or methods, but some have given us hints and tips which are subtle and extremely helpful.  

Back to the original comment, which was suggested before, we are limited by what technology we can use.  Quantum and digital technologies that could possibly scale us &gt; 64 assets at one time today are out of reach (in negotiations though).  Solver software, or even data analytics software is expensive too.  As we gain clients that will pay for what we can contribute (general financial markets analytics capabilities plus quantum annealing expertise, management consulting depth, and creativity in converting problems into matrices that QC can use), we will plow back those revenues into new tools and methods.",1598883818,QuantumComputing,Chicago_Quantum,Quantum,Comment,357

Government isn't going to be the only one.

Yeah, there's going to be jobs.  Good ones.

##Twelve-qubit quantum computing for chemistry


Accurate electronic structure calculations are considered one of the most anticipated applications of quantum computing that will revolutionize theoretical chemistry and other related fields. Using the Google Sycamore quantum processor, Google AI Quantum and collaborators performed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation of two intermediate-scale chemistry problems: the binding energy of hydrogen chains (as large as H12) and the isomerization mechanism of diazene (see the Perspective by Yuan). The simulations were performed on up to 12 qubits, involving up to 72 two-qubit gates, and show that it is possible to achieve chemical accuracy when VQE is combined with error mitigation strategies. The key building blocks of the proposed VQE algorithm are potentially scalable to larger systems that cannot be simulated classically.

##Abstract

The simulation of fermionic systems is among the most anticipated applications of quantum computing. We performed several quantum simulations of chemistry with up to one dozen qubits, including modeling the isomerization mechanism of diazene. We also demonstrated error-mitigation strategies based on N-representability that dramatically improve the effective fidelity of our experiments. Our parameterized ansatz circuits realized the Givens rotation approach to noninteracting fermion evolution, which we variationally optimized to prepare the Hartree-Fock wave function. This ubiquitous algorithmic primitive is classically tractable to simulate yet still generates highly entangled states over the computational basis, which allowed us to assess the performance of our hardware and establish a foundation for scaling up correlated quantum chemistry simulations.",1598604303,QuantumComputing,Bhima,Quantum,Comment,241

4091,"&gt; The dude tries claiming nothing exists. I don’t know much but if anything I know I exist.

I don't know where you're getting that from... what timestamp? At 53:54, he utters the phrase, ""What we really are..."" So, he's not asserting nihilism/solipsism. He's asserting that the notion of a unitary (classical) universe is not possible. Every interpretation of QM agrees on this point, so it's non-controversial. The interpretation he's espousing he terms ""zero-worlds interpretation"", meaning, the world is pure information -- perhaps it is a simulation running in a quantum computer. And that is, more or less, my own cosmological view. It is consistent with QM and it is mathematically equivalent to all the other interpretations.

The novelty of this interpretation is that it builds on information theory ""from the ground up."" So, we start with Shannon's theory of information, augment it with complex-valued von Neumann entropy, and then quantum theory just drops out as a side effect. So all of the ""paradoxes"" of quantum theory are nothing more than the weirdness of complex numbers when viewed through a real-valued (classical) lens. As Scott Aaronson puts it so well: "".. Cancellation between positive and negative amplitudes can be seen as the source of all 'quantum weirdness' -- the one thing that makes quantum mechanics different from classical probability theory. How I wish someone had told me that when I first heard the word 'quantum'!"" [source](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html)

&gt; His argument seems to be that because non-experimental entanglements (i.e. entanglements just within the measurement apparatus) can produce spurious measurements that they necessarily always produce spurious measurements and we can never know anything about the universe.

4092,"Challenging the status quo is great and helps us drive progress...but I think you have maybe misunderstood some of the core concepts. 

Information transmitting faster than the speed is directly mentioned in the special theory of relativity as not possible. (The term used commonly is superluminal communication.) This applies for both massed and massless means.

I couldn't detect if you flipped the coin. I can flip my coin and assume that if we both flipped it in the same way (used the same measurement basis) we would see correlated results. But if you didn't flip it, I would still be able to flip my coin and get a result no matter what you did. 

I think at this point if you really are interested in bucking against the commonly accepted and, frankly, well established understanding you will need to get better at either finding research on your own or comprehending it.

His argument seems to be that because non-experimental entanglements (i.e. entanglements just within the measurement apparatus) can produce spurious measurements that they necessarily always produce spurious measurements and we can never know anything about the universe. That conclusion is obviously a failure in logic (mistaking a probability for an absolute), and leads him out into the weeds where he declares we don't exist. Silly fool! He already showed that there was only a probability that quantum measurements could be spurious, and in fact we can calculate that probability. At the scale of classical physics, of course, our measurements are very reliable and only rarely produce a spurious result such that we observe an extremely consistent universe. Any reasonable person ought to conclude that we do, in fact exist, and so does the universe. Any reasonable person ought to conclude that there's nothing at all wrong with reality as we know it in classical physics, we just can't rely on statistically insignificant measurements at the quantum scale to tell us that.",1598419137,QuantumComputing,silverstonery,Quantum,Comment,192

4109,"Great that you are interested in Quantum Mechanics and asking these questions! 

There is actually quite a lot of literature out there explaining (much better than I can on my phone) why you cannot communicate information with entangled particles. Some call it the ""no-communication"" theory and it is founded on the very laws of quantum mechanics. Also, I don't think Einstein would it because FTL communication would violate relativity. 

So unless our understanding of quantum mechanical systems changes drastically, this is sadly not in the cards. 

I 100% recommend seeking out some of the many available articles about it. Forbes had an approachable one from a few years ago. 

I'll try a simple analogy as a holdover. You and I exchange two quantum entangled coins. A measurement is a coin flip. If we flip them at the same time, we get the same result. If I want to signal to you heads, I would need to not flip my coin but place it heads up. However, this breaks the entanglement (there is math formalism which backs this up). There are other creative ways that they have tried to get around this...but the problem is the results are essentially random seeming to you unless you take multiple flips from the exact same starting state. (You can't do this either because of the no-cloning theorum). So, only once our coin flip results are correlated, would we see they line up perfectly. But that requires us getting back together and negates the instantaneous nature of it.

You could prepare a message for me specifically...but then you have to send the coin to me in which case you could have just sent the message directly.

So if I had 2 occupied orbitals and 2 virtual orbitals in my system, then the simple Hartree-Fock mean field starting state would correspond to the register in the |0011&gt; state.

By running the quantum simulation, the true wavefunction of the full Hamiltonian is some non-trivial linear combination of electronic configurations in the full orbital space (in our case 4 orbitals). Therefore you may end up with a wavefunction for your molecule that is something like |psi&gt; = c\_0 |0011&gt; + c\_1 |1100&gt; where c\_0 and c\_1 are some complex coefficients, and then you can solve for the corresponding eigenvalue (which is the energy) of that ground state vector.",1598313161,QuantumComputing,tstu,Quantum,Comment,133

4176,"You are fundamentally misunderstanding the nature of qubits and quantum computing. Classical bits (like those in your RAM or hard drive) are persistent in time. Of course, even classical bits eventually degrade but the time-horizons can be very long (in some cases, thousands of years or longer).

Qubits, on the other hand, are not persistent at all. A qubit is an ephemeral quantum state that only exists from the time the quantum computation begins until it ends, or sooner if the quantum state decoheres due to interference (noise/perturbation from the environment). For the kinds of qubits being used in current generation NISQ chips, I believe coherence times are on the order of microseconds, or less. ""The coherence times for superconducting quantum computers have improved from 1 nano-second to 100 micro-seconds in last decade [12]. Furthermore, existing superconducting qubits show improving trend in coherence times [4][12]."" [Source, p. 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10224.pdf)

In practical terms, that means you need to set up the initial quantum state, allow the quantum circuit to evolve over some specified duration of time, then measure the resulting quantum state, all within the coherence time. The only evidence that a quantum computation even happened is the classical data that resulted from the final measurement.

In a sense, it is impossible to communicate classical information to or from a quantum computer. The reason is that either form of communication (classical to quantum or quantum to classical) is destructive -- classical-to-quantum will necessarily decohere the quantum state and quantum-to-classical is, by definition, a destructive measurement of the quantum state.",1598195194,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,257

However, as a classical gate unto itself, and as a classical gate along with another classical gate, it doesn’t span even a dense subset of the unitary group.

I’ll add that the quantum startups are only receiving money from big companies (such as finance and pharma) to do fundamental
Research.  No companies, and I mean zero, are giving QC to help with anything actually used in a product.  There’s a lot of money in these big companies, and these exploratory dollars are what are funding the quantum “market”

One example is a company put out a press release with one of the big QC startups saying they helped solve a big logistics problem.  In reality that problem was already solvable on a laptop with CPLEX, and it was just a lone researcher in a big company who did this work for free.  It had zero relevance to anything real.

4209,"We're just in the very early stages of quantum computers moving from academia to industry, added to that the guys in academia are in on average a bit clueless when it comes to industry unless they are spending A LOT of time consulting. 

Commercialization opportunities &amp; applications are unclear.  Check jobs in quantum are right now (check Linkedin in for job openings and people who have jobs) and you will get a rough idea: it also includes cybersecurity &amp; Finance (banks &amp; financial institutions like Goldman sachs). There are lots of start-ups.... Most organizations are trying to figure out their niche/business model (for long term viability). For example, Robert Sutor, VP for Quantum Ecosystem is transparent that we are just starting to figure out the applications.

Quantum computers are somewhere around where computers were when people were using punch-cards back around the  1950's/1960's (rough estimate). The difference is that classical computing (existing computing) improved linearly (moor's law) where as  quantum computers will improve exponentially, so it won't take 20 years for quantum computers to be useful (\~1950/1960s's computers to late 1970's-1980s computers).

You should be asking yourself if you want to get in at the ground floor, which means a bit of risk, where things are unknown (bleeding-edge tech means some people get cut).

The reason I am proposing qutip over, for example, qiskit, is that it actually simulates the physical system, thus matching your title ""qubit interaction"".

You can write down a Hamiltonian (the mathematical object describing interaction) in qutip, tune its parameters (translating in real life to, for example, turning on a laser to control your trapped ion qubit or turning on a microwave pulse in a superconducting qubit to perform a gate) and therefore simulate the physical quantum mechanical system on your classical PC. 

The disadvantage is that you need some knowledge on the actual physics. Keywords: density matrix, master equation formalism, dissipative evolution, open quantum systems. There are plenty of references, but all with quite some overhead. I would think that the Nielsen and Chuang, Quantum Computing and Quantum Information could be a good starting point. You will have to get familiar with quite some linear algebra, and of course quantum mechanics, but the book is quite self-contained so given time and dedication it could work out. 

Given that the above mentioned is quite ambitious (especially if you have to self-teach), I see two other things that could interest you: 

\- Simulating the Schrödinger Equation (you can write the numerical scheme to simulate it and then perform experiments on it to observe phenomena such as tunneling and bonding of molecules

Regarding that I say do what interests you the most. Do what you enjoy doing the most. This is more important than anything else.

If you're thinking ""80mil is a ton of money, why would they go belly up in 5 years?"" 

The answer is simple: it costs a ridiculous amount of money to run a hardware development program. Cleanrooms have extremely high operating costs after the upfront costs (e.g. building the rooms, buying the tools). Fridges consume a lot of electricity, cost a lot up front, and have continual maintanance requirements that at least involve hiring an engineer or two to keep things running smoothly. Then you have the large team of engineers and scientists who design, make, and measure circuits who probably on average cost 100k/year /person. Their crunchbase profile says they have 100-250 employees. So that is order 10 mil right there alone.

I don't know what their annual operating costs are but it wouldn't surprise me if it is in the ballpark of 20 million a year. As a mid-sized university group, we burn something like 1-1.5 million a year. And we do not really pay even a quarter of the real cost to use the cleanroom facilities we have (it is essentially run at a deficit by the school) nor the real energy costs of the fridges.",1597925897,QuantumComputing,NSubsetH,Quantum,Comment,208

Thus, you can use quantum superposition, quantum intrication, ... which sort of allow you to perform multiple computations at the same time.

4294,"Quantum mechanics is specifically a nonrelativistic theory: the Schrodinger equation is a low-velocity approximation of the Klein–Gordon equation.

A quantum superposition is different than a mere probability distribution.  A wavefunction assigns to each classical measurement outcome a complex number. A complex number can be thought of as an arrow on the plane with a direction (the ""phase"") and a magnitude (the ""amplitude"").  The Born rule says how to derive a probability distribution from a wavefunction: you square the amplitude of each basis vector to get the probability of that outcome.  Since the total probability that *something* happens is 1, the wavefunction satisfies the property that the sum of the amplitudes squared is 1.

The fact that the wavefunction is complex is important: it's what allows for destructive interference in experiments like the double slit experiment.  It's what makes Shor's algorithm for factoring products of large primes better than any known classical algorithm.

Superposition is a mathematical concept.  It shows up in waves: a chord is a superposition of notes played at the same time.  It also shows up in vectors: northeast = 1/sqrt(2) (north + east) is a superposition of north and east, but so is northwest = 1/sqrt(2) (north - east).

The question of what the mathematical waves in the Schrodinger equation mean, physically, depends on what interpretation of quantum mechanics you prefer.  There are lots and lots of interpretations, and nobody has figured out a way to distinguish them yet experimentally. The Bohmian interpretation says that particles have specific properties like position and momentum, but there's an extra potential energy term that depends instantaneously on the configuration of all matter in the universe.  The Copenhagen interpretation says that particles don't have specific properties until they're measured, and that a measurement ""collapses the wavefunction"", instantaneously causing the wavefunction to change shape.  Penrose's interpretation says that the wave function collapses randomly at a rate that depends on how much difference there is in the curvature of spacetime instead of due to a measurement. The many worlds interpretation says that the wavefunction is real and all there is; we're living in a universe that's a big chord of classical possibilities.  Whenever we make a measurement, our brains get entangled with the quantum system being measured and different versions of us remember the different outcomes.  't Hooft proposed a cellular-automaton-like model where stuff happens deterministically and classically at the Planck scale, but it looks like a wave medium at the atomic scale.

4350,"Thanks for your advice! I'm going to check out the Linear Algebra primer in Mike and Ike and see if I can extend my linear algebra chops to get better at quantum computing. I actually really enjoy the proof aspect of mathematics, so maybe this is a good thing/good start? I'll see how I can improve in this area. I'm a self-taught programmer so i'm painfully aware that i lack a lot of academic rigor that most cs majors have coming out with a bachelor's degree. I've been taking math and cs courses at community college for the last 2 years to bridge this gap! 

I know that my post is vague in some areas, I'm still exploring what research topics are available to me. After taking these introductory quantum computing courses I feel like I have a better idea of where my interests are. Currently, i'm doing a fair broad sweep of different topics in quantum information research before I settle on a few that really catch my attention.

4356," You need to figure out which area of quantum computing you want to start with. Each area will require a different background to understand. For example, you have a computer science background so you may be interested to know that there are many areas of quantum computing that do not require any physics background, only a strong knowledge of complexity/algorithms and linear algebra. It is hard for me to know exactly where your issues are coming from but if I had to bet it is that your linear algebra skills are lacking. Most intro to linear algebra classes do not go in-depth or theoretical enough to be sufficient for quantum computing. I suggest you study the linear algebra section of Mike and Ike to both learn the required linear algebra and evaluate your current knowledge. It may also be that you are simply lacking the required mathematical maturity. In fact, this is the one requirement Mike and Ike suggest a reader has in addition to an undergrad degree in CS, math, or physics. To develop this you will need to solve a lot of problems. Preferably problems that require proof writing. Of course, these are just guesses as too where the issues might be.

4361,"Hey there, I'm an undergrad Physicist and I've been working over the summer with a research group in the field of quantum information. Like you I found it was all so new to me at the start that there was way too much to take in and I really didn't understand any papers. I found that I eventually started to get it by trying to write some code to apply some is the stuff on the papers. This really helped my practical understanding! 
However I went in having covered one university course in quantum mechanics already. It sounds like you have done some stuff already, in not familiar with and of the books/courses you listed though. If you do want to do more basic QM then I'd recommend something like Leonard Susskind's theoretical minimum lectures on quantum mechanics on YouTube. I used them to help them with my uni course and I found them a really great introduction to the key course in quantum mechanics. They should help your understanding of some of the more basic stuff. Then I'm not sure what the best way to go from there is. Like I say what helped me was trying to write code to simulate things, and that helped make sure I understood them properly. I'll also mention that someone gave me advice that when you're reading papers you should be taking notes as you go, that really helped me to take in more of what I read when j started doing that.

There are a lot of resources out there, and depending on your background I think you will have to look around. 

IBM has a nice little textbook that combines coding and theory, which I think can be suitable for anyone that lacks the quantum physics background but knows a bit about programming. It's heavily centered on IBM's software stack for quantum computing called Qiskit. They're also doing a YouTube series, which I haven't watched so can't say if it's good or not.

The textbook that most people would recommend for this would be ""Quantum Computation and Quantum Information"" by Nielsen and Chuang.

Other than that, just searching for tutorials online will probably be helpful. Also, getting your hands dirty and actually solving some of the equations or programming something is invaluable for learning this kind of topic.",1597397520,QuantumComputing,slakeslak,Quantum,Comment,141

Constructive feedback:

1. I don't think there is a way to go back (besides the replay button). If there was a way, I couldn't find it. I should be able to remove gates that I have already placed.
2. If you can only add gates to the end (instead of in the middle) then you should just add the gate when i click it, instead of making a box appear and then i have to click the box. Or ideally, I should be able to drag gates to wherever I want to place them.
3. I don't really understand the 0/1/-1/-0 notation. I could just be stuck in my ways.  I guess negative corresponds to a 90⁰ phase rotation, but idk how that generalizes. Maybe it's a simpler and elegant than i am giving it credit for, so feel free to chime in.

4391,"This question is lacking a bit of context, but since this is posted in r/QuantumComputing I'll give a QC answer:

You might be familiar with the following method of measuring qubits in the X basis: Instead of measuring in the X basis directly we can use the H gate (which maps |+&gt; to |0&gt; and |-&gt; to |1&gt;) to transform between the X basis and the computational basis, after which we can do a computational basis measurement. So H gate + computational basis measurement is effectively an X basis measurement.

For Bell basis measurements we can do something similar: We can transform a 2 qubit Bell state into a computational basis state by applying CNOT(a,b) followed by H(a). This maps |\\Phi+&gt; to |00&gt;, |\\Phi-&gt; to |10&gt;, |\\Psi+&gt; to |01&gt;, and |\\Psi-&gt; to |11&gt;. After this mapping you can measure both qubits individually in the computational basis. If you want to end up with a Bell state as post-measurement state you'll need to apply H(a) followed by CNOT(a,b) to the computational basis post-measurement state.",1597314778,QuantumComputing,master_obi-wan,Quantum,Comment,173

4404,"You have an annealing program going from time t0000 to t1000. Imagine that in the middle of your annealing program, you have 2000 qubits in a specific ""t316"" state (ie. each of them is either ""up"" or ""down"", and all the constraints - like ""Q197 is opposite to Q451"" - are trying to be enforced). In this state, the system has a total energy. If N qubits (Q009, Q713, Q270 ...) were flipped, the energy would be lower and you would reach state ""t317"" of the annealing program. However, if you flip less than N, the energy is higher (because some constraints are badly violated). That means you cannot get from state ""t316"" to state ""t317"" by sequentially flipping qubits. Since classically there is a zero probability of instantaneously flipping just the right N qubits, you cannot get from t316 to t317. However, with tunnelling (ie, something that is highly improbable classically, can happen quantum mechanically) you can flip the N qubits. So you get to the lower energy state t317 and your annealing program continues to move forward. At t1000, you end up in the lowest energy state possible, and this optimally satisfies all the constraints you programmed in.

4425,"One thing, it's not that you aren't smart enough but rather you don't have the training.  This is particularly a crucial perspective to have when dealing with quantum mechanics because it is mechanics that our brains did not evolve in.  So it literally is impossible for quantum mechanics to become intuitive in the same way as your intuition for gravity was baked into you as a baby and hence, you can walk while on auto pilot.  

Because of this, graduate students in physics have to create a whole new world in their heads to gain something that can be called intuition (but yeah not so much).  So we can at least work with the quantum realm quite easily; it's rather simple linear algebra and a little difficult functional analysis.  The hard part is the interpretation, which is your point.  This is why Feynman said something like no one really understands quantum mechanics.  I get many students ask me, ""okay what is actually going on?""  Well the ""actually"" is something that our brains did not evolve to understand so I tell them to let go and create a new world for this stuff...

Those who suggested resources for check out— thank you so much. I appreciate you guidance.


To everyone asking about my resources “just cause”:

As I said, I’m only starting to learn and I watched a couple YouTube videos and skimmed over the following research paper before coming here:

The Logic of Quantum Theory— C.J. Isham


However, I did not do that as a prerequisite to asking a question here, nor does such an expectation even make sense to me. I’m expected to have gone somewhere else on the internet to get the info before I ask on here, as if I forced you to reply to me post! Very strange. You seem to have the time to reply with a challenge to my background “to save your time,” but you’re not considering that not commenting would save you even more time!

Anyway, I believe such threads exist to answer specific questions by people regardless of their background. I would not have come here had I been an expert or had I found the resources necessary to answer my question. I suggest that you try not to discourage people from posting, especially if the post is not directed at you personally.

4430,"&gt; reading about how quantum computing can result true, false, or in between.

I'm afraid that's not entirely correct, or at least it's strongly simplified. 

In a regular computer circuit, the state of each bit at each moment can be characterized by either one of two possible states: 1 (which we interpret as True) and 0 (which we interpret as False). If you dig deeper into the hardware of a computer, there's no 1s or 0s there - the 'bits' are actually electrical structures which hold voltage against a reference potential. Commonly, the voltage is between 0V and 5V - if it's closer to 0V we say it's a logical 0, and if it's closer to 5V we say it's a logical 1. So the bit actually has a continous real value 0V-5V which we can deterministically translate to true or false.

In the case of quantum computers, the *final* result is still either true or false. However, each qubit is now characterized by two (not one) complex (not real) values (this is still a bit simplified though and does not hold when qbits are entangled - but anyway). When we measure the qubit, we either get a True or a False - but this time the mapping is not deterministic. For a classical computer we had a range of possible bit states (0 volts up to 5 volts) and for each state we could say if that's a true (above 2.5 volts) or a false (below 2.5 volts). For quantum bits, some states always result in a True, some states always result in a False, and the rest of them result in either a True or a False in a certain percentage of time (e.g. if you setup your qubit in that state and measure it and do this 1000 time, suppose 30% of the times you'll get true and 70% you'll get false).

This is the meaning behind the ""it's neither true nor false"". Hope this helps.",1597127776,QuantumComputing,alin1popa,Quantum,Comment,329

4475,"Ideas about other dimensions and parallel universes are plausible, but the fact is we have no idea about the underlying mechanism of quantum weirdness, i.e. the ""universal wave function.""   There are many interesting theories on its true nature, but they're speculation.  Quantum computing is only concerned with how it behaves on a mathematical level, which we understand quite well.

The ""magic"" that makes the quantum weirdness useful for certain calculations comes down to what we call EPR Phenomena, namely quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation.  It's basically how the universe manages to stay consistent across all of time and space despite being constructed out of individually random systems.

Imagine Schrodinger puts the cat in the box.  Classically, the outcome of the measurement is the cat is dead or alive, but we can say that there are actually four potential outcomes.

* 1: The poison is not released and the cat is alive.
* 2: The poison is not released and the cat is dead.
* 3: The poison is released and the cat is alive.
* 4: The poison is released and the cat is dead.

But even in this self-contained random reality, there is little chance that the cat will survive being poisoned, so we can say the states ""alive vs. dead."" and ""poisoned vs. not poisoned"" are entangled.  So in other words, even if we don't know the cat is alive or dead, by simply measuring that the poison was released, we dramatically amplify the likelihood that the cat will be dead even without opening the box and observing it, and vice versa.

But let's say Schrodinger plucks the one of the cat's hairs before putting it in the box. While it's inside, he analyzes the genome of the hair and finds it actually has a gene that makes it immune to the poison.  This discovery collapses the cat's superposition to being ""alive"" instantaneously, without making a measurement of the cat or the poison.  So despite initially expecting a measurement, he's changed the basis from ""is the cat dead or alive"" to ""the cat is alive, but was the poison released or not?"" without even opening the box.  That's essentially the mechanism of quantum teleportation- constructing a unique set of possibilities by making partial measurements of other systems that are entangled with it without measuring the system itself.

That's essentially how quantum computers make calculations.  By altering the basis on which we measure the state of a system, we can amplify or reduce the probability of getting a particular outcome or set of outcomes.",1596670200,QuantumComputing,SuperStingray,Quantum,Comment,425

What do you think as far as a timeline before it starts to shake things up in a way that the general public is aware of?

I do think that AI and QC could be super scary for humanity in the long run.  I wish that AI and QC were kept separate and ISOLATED so that AI on QC is banned.  Never gonna happen, but I see it as containment efforts in a virology lab (sorry for the timely analogy).  If AI gets out of hand with regular supercomputer we would have the QC available and ""clean/uninfected"" to counter and overwhelm the AI like an ""antiviral agent"".  I understand that tinkering/developments with AI in the mean time would be hampered some and would be a pain in the butt, but so is working with potentially dangerous viruses with all of their associated containment efforts.

I also think that QC will eventually be an existential threat to many/most/all crypto, blockchain, and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT).  I think that it will be an arms race between QC and DLT at some point that won't really start until either QC strikes the first blow or has a widely publicized breakthrough that shakes up DLT.

4491,"I prefer to think about quantum phenomena in terms of QC rather than QM because QC (and QIT) does not require us to make any revisions of our intuitions about the world. Quantum Mechanics *contradicts* classical mechanics and, in this respect, it contradicts our intuitions in a manner similar to relativity (which also contradicts classical mechanics). Classical mechanics is a mathematically precise explication of our intuitive notions of space, time and motion in 3D Euclidean space. So, to have that ""perfect"" model contradicted can be very disorienting for many people.

But QIT does not contradict classical information theory, it augments it. QC does not contradict classical computing theory, it augments it. From the standpoint of systems design, a quantum computer can be regarded as a kind of *stochastic* computer. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_computing). There are various definitions of stochastic computing but the unifying pattern is that stochastic computing uses *unreliable* computing elements to perform *reliable* computations. It accomplishes this feat by the use *encoding*, *estimation* and *repetition*. To solve a computational problem, we first encode it in such a way that the underlying, error-prone computational hardware can be corrected. Then, we monitor the correctness of the computational result either by simple repetition (common in NISQ computers) or by the use of error-correcting/detecting codes. So, this is why there is a lot of active research in constructing error-correcting qubits so that we can go beyond NISQ computing (simple repetition, sampling of qubit outputs) into more robust performance profiles.

As for why quantum computers seem to do so much more than ordinary computers, it might be helpful to contrast the nature of wave mechanics with digital computation. Let's leave QM out of the picture. The hardware in an ordinary digital computer seeks to implement what we might call an ""ideal switch"". That's what the transistor is. It is an ideal discontinuity. But we live in a wave-like (continuous) reality (ignoring QM for now). So the transistor is actually an illusion. It's a really good illusion since error rates in transistors can be made *extremely* small. But it's still an illusion. Everything else we do with a classical computer is built on top of this basic illusion, or *restriction*. The value of the transistor is its noise-immunity.

An analog computer is at the opposite extreme. An analog computer is a completely continuous (wavelike) device. Analog computers can compute complex problems that require super-linear time on a classical computer *in a single time-step*. That's because the analog computer is utilizing ""the full power"" of the (classical) laws of physics. But analog computers have two fatal flaws: (a) noise-sensitivity and (b) inaccuracy. These flaws are why digital computers have been dominant in the last 70 years.

Quantum computers are a lot more like analog computers than digital computers. But keep in mind that the quantum computer does *not* assume that the world is ""fundamentally wave-like"" (classical mechanics), as analog computers do. So QC is able to operate in a mode that is like a hybrid of analog and digital. We observe its discrete outputs but its computational process can only correctly be described in a continuous space (the complex Hilbert space). QC is not inaccurate but it is also not reliable -- that is, it is either completely correct or completely random some percentage of the time. And QC is maximally noise-sensitive (decoherence due to environmental interference).",1596640446,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,560

4498,"**Nonlinearity**

That's not exactly right. Evolution of a quantum system follows Schrodinger's equation, which is linear. (There are nonlinear formulations that describe evolution of systems with uncertainty, et cetera, but they just offer another perspective.) Quantum phenomena are plenty weird, but they're (arguably) never nonlinear.

**Other dimensions**

This kind of claim doesn't sound awfully familiar to me, but I'm going to guess that it's based on the ""parallel universes"" idea (the idea that each of several superposed states is its own universe) combined with the informal use of ""dimension"" to refer to a ""reality"" or ""plane of existence."" In some cases it's kinda reasonable to view a quantum algorithm as simultaneously doing different parts of a calculation in ""different realities.""

Of course, the trouble with that is, that what quantum physics is telling us is that *reality* (in the singular) contains multiple superposed states. So I don't know in what sense they are really separate realities after all.

**Extra speed**

Imagine you converted your car into some James-Bond style amphibious craft that could travel across water as well as land. For some problems (e.g., getting from Spain to Morocco) that would be much much faster. For other problem (e.g., getting from Calgary to CDMX) it wouldn't save you any time at all.

We've been working on doing calculations on non-quantum computers for many decades and have some very efficient algorithms and solid ideas about how long things take. Suddenly there's a new tool. For a lot of problems, it makes no difference whatsoever. But there are a few problem classes where people have devised quantum algorithms that perform a lot better than any non-quantum algorithm, so it will definitely speed *some* things up.",1596613033,QuantumComputing,dbulger,Quantum,Comment,283

I always figured that part of what makes them faster has something to do with this aspect, but I don't know if that is true. Is it faster because the calculations are happening in so many dimensions simultaneously and does the local time flow in the given dimensions come into play? Is it because the dimension(s) where the calculations happen are in the past, present, and future simultaneously before feeding results back to the present?  How do we get these claims of 500,000x the speed?  Is it because they are operating in 100,000's of dimensions?",1596611823,QuantumComputing,Draco-Aurum,Quantum,Comment,133

Due to ""linearity"" and ""decoherence,"" these simultaneous superpositions of states are normally not apparent to us at the macroscopic level. (And for that reason, we've evolved, genetically, culturally and personally, an intuitional framework that makes it all seem rather implausible.)

But under careful laboratory conditions, we can control decoherence in such a way as to preserve and exploit simultaneous superpositions of memory states inside computers. Then (just as with any expanded set of capabilities, I suppose) you get new possibilities for the processing of information.

4502,"I work with trapped ions. The ions are often cooled using various laser cooling methods (Doppler, resolved sideband and EIT cooling) to their motional ground state, typically to temperatures of several uK. This doesn't require any cooling of the surrounding trap, only the ions themselves are cooled. The thermal coupling between the ions and the trap is extremely weak, so the temperature difference is not a problem.

However, for large ion arrays, cooling the trap and particularly the surrounding vacuum chamber is beneficial for several reaaons. One important reason is the quality of the vacuum. Although non-cooled traps can achieve ultra-high vacuum, it turns out that there are still enough background particles such that collisions with the chain happen on a regular basis. If you have more ions, the collision rate is correspondingly higher. So for working with large chains, an extremely clean vacuum is useful. And such a vacuum can only be achieved in cryogenic environments, i.e. by cooling the entire vacuum chamber.

There are also other reasons for cooling the chamber: the heating rate is even lower, and the background blackbody radiation is also lower.

To the best of my knowledge, the large ion array quantum information experiments (there are very few of them) all use cryogenic setups.",1596574585,QuantumComputing,TheSumOfAllPeanuts,Quantum,Comment,210

There are some programs where the applied physics/quantum computing research almost exclusively resides within the Electrical Engineering departments - the two main ones here are Princeton and University of Texas, Austin.

Two other options include UChicago's Molecular Engineering program, and UWaterloo's Institute of Quantum Computing. Wisconsin is one of the few schools that has a dedicated ""quantum computing"" degree, but that is specifically targeted at the Master's level, not a Ph.D. 

I'm not entirely clear how courses are able to transfer from an EE program to a Physics program, but my understanding is that you would need to pass qualifier exams in physics. One thing to keep in mind as you choose courses in electrical engineering (it sounds like you are just beginning your program, given your graduation date?) is to choose courses that would prepare you for physics style Ph.D. if that is what you want.

4539,"&gt;How can a qc know something, that a human cannot?

How can a classical (normal) computer know something humans can not? It is because of normal computers process information in a fundamentally different way than the human mind. The same goes for quantum computers. They process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computers. 

The obvious follow-up question is, how can quantum computers process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computers? Other commenters have given algorithms and processes which demonstrate this. Still, it sounds like you are asking for a more fundamental answer. The theory of quantum mechanics tells us that the way information works, how information can be processed and communicated, is fundamentally different from how it appears to work in our everyday life. The reason it can be so different than it appears is that when you have a large number of particles interacting together, as we do in everyday life or in most classical computers, all this weirdness about information working differently averages out. Quantum computers isolate particles so that this averaging doesn't take place. This means a quantum computer can take advantage of the fact that information behaves a lot weirder than we experience it. In fact, the quantum computer can leverage this weirdness to learn things that a human or classical computer couldn't possibly learn on their own.

4544,"I’ll caveat this by stating that I am somewhat new to the field and coming at it from a physics rather than an engineering perspective.

You start with a qubit in an initial state. Qubits can be made from an electron, a polarized photon, or a variety of other things, but the important thing is that there are two basis states (usually labeled |0&gt; and |1&gt;) that the system can collapse to on measurement. Definitely read up on the Bloch sphere if you haven’t already.

Quantum gates change the state of the system in some specified way and are represented by unitary matrices; the Paulo spin matrices are some examples of these. IIRC, the gates are usually implemented by hitting the qubit with a light pulse that will change the state. For example the X gate (represented by the Pauli-X matrix) will swap the states, so if you started in |0&gt; you would write X|0&gt; = |1&gt;; therefore the X gate corresponds to the classical NOT gate. You could have done this by taking a polarized photon and rotating the polarization by 90 degrees, or by exciting a two-level atomic system from the ground state.

I haven’t learned much about measurement yet, but if your final state is a superposition you will have a probability of measuring either one of your basis states after implementing your gates. Say your final state is a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;, where a and b are numbers. The probability of getting |0&gt; is a^2 and the probability of getting |0&gt; is b^2. But once you measure, you collapse the state; you don’t get to measure both a and b on a single qubit. To get both a and b from measurement rather than calculating the state through the circuit by hand, you’ll need to run the circuit enough times to get a statistical distribution for the value of a and b.

Hope this was somewhat helpful. If you want to read up more on the implementation aspect or just try out a quantum computer, check out IBM’s quantum computing.

The most easy example is Deutsch's algorithm - once you have calculated how the quantum (logical) gates act on the state of the qubits, you see that the quantum way can be faster than the classical way which can't use superposition.

Deutsch's algorithm for pedestrians:  
You want to check whether a coin has different or equal symbols on each side.  
Classic approach: 1. look on one side. 2. look on other side.  
Quantum approach: 1. create superposition of sides. 2. look at superposition.

In this example, the QC needs to look only once and can thus be called ""twice faster"" than the classical computer. This advantage scales exponentially with the number of sides of the coins (Deutsch-Josza algorithm), so if you take N qubits, the QC will be 2\^N times faster.",1596278882,QuantumComputing,picovoxel,Quantum,Comment,156

Quantum research is stable, but that requires a PhD, and there are only a handful of positions.  The CS industry is obviously massive with so many more job opportunities.  It also has deep mathematical fields, and is useful today.  I wish someone had told me this before I went down the physics path.

4570,"As the other comment said you won’t see any speed gains in a simulation because it’s still running on a classical computer. For true “benchmarks” I think we need actual quantum computers to have a good real life understanding. But in general we have profs that assuming quantum computers are feasible they will be faster when the input gets big enough.  

You need to understand quantum computing and complexity theory to really get an understanding of it all but I can give a somewhat concrete example. So imagine you have a list of random numbers and you want to know whether the number zero is in you list. In classical computing the best way to find the answer is to check every number until you find zero or reach the end of the list. Given lots and lots of such lists on average you have to check have the list. So if you get a new list that’s twice as long as the previous one you can expect to take twice as long to get your answers. As your list size grows you expect your algorithm runtime to more or less increase linearly. Now with quantum computing there is an algorithm for this search that grows with the square root of the list size. This means you have to quadruple your list size to double the expected run time. This may not sound like much but theoretically it’s actually a huge deal. This means that even if single operations take 100 times longer on a quantum computer then there still is a list size where suddenly big enough quantum computers are going to be faster than your biggest classical computer. That is lists that are about 10000 times bigger than your base comparison. 

This is really rough and an estimation but it gives the general idea of how we know there are likely special things we can accomplish with quantum computers. 

It’s also worth saying that not everything is faster with quantum computers. That is classical computers will probably always be around and even with quantum computer algorithms they often have a classical component involved.",1596080060,QuantumComputing,korbonix,Quantum,Comment,355

Take Google's XMon. Those are, say, ~400 um x 400um. Assume you just do direct capacitive coupling between them (so add in some spacing and round to 500x500um). A 100 x 100 qubit grid (so 10,000 qubits) is a 5 cm chip. So just for the qubit chip, that wouldn't be too bad. Except you now need a way to get gates (microwave pulses) down to everyone of those qubits. Currently that means microwave generators and AWGs at room temperature. Not to mention dc/low freq signals to tune SQUIDs of those qubits.

Realistically to have good fidelities, you need to have those qubits likely separated by resonant buses (or something to control the coupling strength to avoid cross talk), so now the grid is at least 2-3 times bigger in size, plus tons of wiring going through your fridge down to your mixing chamber.",1595988090,QuantumComputing,EngSciGuy,Quantum,Comment,168

Day-to-day, my work was very similar to physics research in the lab. My primary tasks were focused on optomechanical design, testing out new ideas in the lab, and doing system maintenance tasks. It takes a village to maintain, run, and operate these systems, so there are senior physicists running experiments, analyzing data, and working together with computer scientists to create better pipelines for executing code. The theorists work on theoretical problems, tackling questions about noise and algorithms, and also provide a lot of support in analyzing the weaknesses of current systems so that they can improve it further.

I think the best way to get a sense for what that kind of work looks like is to **get involved in a research lab** while you are an undergrad on campus. Every single senior physicist at IonQ, as well as a large portion of the computer scientists, theorists, and engineers, all had PhD degrees, and came from a background doing research.

4726,"&gt;	I'm not aware of anything that this would be useful for.

Absolutely nothing I can think of. It’s like the ‘absurd’ MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data) quadrant in the classical sequential/parallel processing paradigm: it’s there for logical consistency, but it isn’t (apparently) useful for much that anybody can think of (yet?).

&gt;	will note that putting the state of an entire CPU under superposition would be absurdly expensive to error correct, so there'd have to be some huge enabling benefit to doing it.

Actually that’s tangentially part of the way I found myself thinking of this. I read a book by hard-sci-fi author Greg Egan dealing with (amongst other things) an A.I. implemented one a quantum professor shielded from the rest of the universe, and I’ve been toying with how utterly beyond comprehension such a task would be if one were think it through.",1595432932,QuantumComputing,qubex,Quantum,Comment,145
4727,"Basically the way you would achieve this is the same way it's done classically. You would have a quantum instruction pointer register, which would determine where a value was read from a quantum RAM, and that value would control which operation was applied. There are a few corner cases you'd have to watch out for to ensure the lookup+decode+apply process was reversible. In particular, you would need to ensure that all paths through the program had the same instruction count and final instruction pointer in order to allow those paths to interfere.

4729,"I'm curious in what kind of situations this would be useful.

In its simplest form a quantum algorithm can be reduced to one single unitary operator that acts on n qubits, followed by some measurements. (Although the measurements might complicate some things if the algorithm depends on measurement results, not sure).  
 
So if you have two programs represented by operators S and G, then a superposition of these programs would be applying the operator αS + βG where |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1.

&gt; What would one expect to measure when one observes it?

With |α|^2 probability you get the results of Shor's algorithm and with |β|^2 probability the result of Grover's. Would you expect something else?   
Whether that is useful is up to you. You might as well just flip a coin first to decide which program to run, without having to put them 'in superposition'. 
 
---

I am not exactly sure what you mean by ""program memory"", but if you want it to be in superposition it'd have to be a quantum memory. Usually programs are purely classical, so you would have to find some way to turn each instruction and logic within your program/algorithm into a quantum operator.

QRAM doesn't exist. And in some ways it actually makes the scaling of Grover's algorithm worse than the classical version. Searching a classical database is O(n). Grover's is O(sqrt(n)). But preparing the qubits for Grover's is likely O(n), so in practice Grover's becomes O(n^3/2)

Anyway, I followed two bachelor courses and they were very doable imo. The first one involved classical mechanics, mainly focused on waves and was followed by a mostly conceptual introduction to QM. Then, the second course that I was following at the same time involved a mathematical approach to QM.  I got 85% on my exam.

I am next year starting a masters course in modern quantum chemistry, which involves doing calculation on supercomputers (mind you not quantum computers).

To get you started  with QM I would recommend the following subjects:

-VERY good calculus skills
-Basic linear algebra (very basic)
-Classical mechanics (especially waves, circular motion)
-Partial differential equations (IMPORTANT)
-Basic knowledge of series

I believe if you continue to pursue this path in the more physical direction you will find that you will need more statistics and advanced linear algebra etc.

Just remember that this only applies to *global* phases of an entire state. Differences in relative phases of states in superposition (i.e. the superposition is the ""entire"" state) can definitely make a difference. For instance, the qubit state |+&gt; = (|0&gt; + |1&gt;)/√2 is orthogonal to the state |-&gt; = (|0&gt; - |1&gt;)/√2 and the only difference is the relative phase between |0&gt; and |1&gt;.

On the Bloch sphere these states both live on opposite sides of the equator. You can think of the vertical angle on the Bloch sphere as representing how much |0&gt; or |1&gt; is in a superposition (closer to north = more |0&gt;) and the horizontal as representing the phase difference between the |0&gt; and |1&gt; parts (|+&gt; has a phase difference of 0 and |-&gt; has a phase difference of π because e^iπ = -1).

4768,"It seems your question has been answered but here's a slightly more in depth explanation of how and why the bloch sphere omits global phase:

The global phase of a quantum state does not affect the measurement, this can be seen by considering a state |S&gt; and the same state with some global phase in front e^iP |S&gt;, the expectation value of any observable O on these states will be the same because

&lt;S|e^-iP O e^iP|S&gt; = e^iP e^-iP &lt;S|O|S&gt; = &lt;S|O|S&gt;.

So we now know that any quantum state |S&gt; is indistinguishable from e^iP |S&gt; through any real world measurement so the states are effectively the same.

Any single qubit state can be written as |q&gt; = e^iN a |0&gt; + e^iM b |1&gt; where a and b are real numbers such that a^2 + b^2 = 1. We know that global phases are irrelevant so we can rewrite our state like so

e^iN a |0&gt; + e^iM b |1&gt; ~ a |0&gt; + e^i(M-N) b |1&gt;

Also, since we know that a^2 +b^2 = 1, we can rewrite

a = cos(T/2), b=sin(T/2) (the factor of a half makes things neater)

We can now represent our qubit state with simply two angles, T and (M-N) and we are only able to do this because global phase is irrelevant.",1595237711,QuantumComputing,Joff_Mengum,Quantum,Comment,219

 I applied with letters (different ones for different schools obviously) describing my interest in working with different profs and then met with all of them after admissions. In my experience that is what most people do in chemistry and physics. 

If you have a contact with the supervisor in advance than sure, what you did is probably the best approach. But if you don't, you don't want to write a letter targeting a single specific field with one faculty member, that may very well not have the time or resources to hire.

In CS at U of T, there are only two faculty that do QC as far as I know. If neither is hiring, then the OP will get rejected. Whereas if the OP is interested in CS theory, with a specific interest in QC, he could get accepted with offers from other CS theory faculty, even if no QC spots are open.

And what I meant by generalist is that there is no MSc in Quantum Computing, that's not a thing. And if you do a MSc in physics you can't just take QC courses, you need to take courses in multiple disciplines.

I talked to profs at each university whose research I was interested in. If they had space and were interested in me as a candidate I applied to the university. When I eventually selected a school to attend it was with an explicit agreement with the supervisor that I would be working in their lab.

So I wouldn't describe the experience of my friends or I as ""very generalist"" because we all targeted a specific research field + group before accepting an offer.

I would also say that writing a general letter to the program is a bad idea if you're committed to wanting to work in QC or any specific field for that matter. Be specific and say in your letter who you want to work with and explain why that's why you're applying to that school.

4819,"So I don't know as much about engineering, but in the sciences (and comp. sci. too, it's basically a science right?) MScs are not offered in specific topics in Canada. So you would be applying for a MSc in Comp. Sci., or in Physics, or in Chemistry, not Quantum Computing. Once accepted / during the admission process, you find a supervisor who's research interest you, and then work with them on your thesis.

When you do so you need to write an application letter, that describes what sort of research you are interested in. There, you would probably talk about your love of quantum computing or whatever topic of interest. The problem is that if you are applying to a dept with only one quantum computing prof, and they already have enough students / decided that they are not interested in your application specifically, the dept may reject you because they don't have a place for you.

So generally, in Canada and in the Sciences, you should approach MSc with an open mind as to the specific field you want to work in, and write your application as such. If you want to do a MSc but \*only\* in Quant. Computing, you probably won't enjoy the MSc program of most Canadian universities, as they tend to be very generalist.

Engineering programs have ""professional"" masters, that are much more specific and where you get to choose what topic you want to do (as opposed to being told by your supervisor :D ). However they are expensive (U of T charges 15 k a year? Probably more for international students... In contrast, MSc students are always covered first year with full stipend. ) However, I doubt there are any professional masters in Quantum Computing, they tend to be more focused on industry topics.

4883,"The reason why everything is simulated is partly because of the few available resources and partly because current quantum computers work poorly. At this time, you will get better performance (for your clients) by running algorithms in a fast quantum simulator like qulacs or qhipster. 

Not only can you readily simulate more qubits (easily 30 on a mid range classical computer) than most available quantum computers have, you won't have to contend with initialization or with noise. Noise on current machines is far from random or unstructured, so it can significantly change the very results you are getting in non trivial ways, and cannot be used as a cryptographically secure RNG.

4891,"This is reddit and not a scientific conference, thank you but I'll stick to a more broadly accessible language.

IBM's paper claims that you can classically simulate 54 qubits on the Summit supercomputer, though it's not been done in practice.

IBM's computer with 20 qubits was used to study quantum quenches. Doing the exact same thing with a 55+ qubits machine is out of reach for current supercomputers and indeed very interesting for any physicist. And thus, ""simulating quantum systems of practical interest might be around the corner"".

The fact that you cite blog articles rather than actual publications  and struggle to understand the difficulty of classically simulating quantum systems suggests to me that you might want to learn about the basics first, I highly recommend: [https://books.google.at/books/about/Quantum\_Computation\_and\_Quantum\_Informat.html?id=65FqEKQOfP8C&amp;redir\_esc=y](https://books.google.at/books/about/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Informat.html?id=65FqEKQOfP8C&amp;redir_esc=y).",1594796909,QuantumComputing,quantum_steve,Quantum,Comment,127

IBM didn't actually run the simulation they described, they only published a paper about how you might go about doing that simulation. I don't know if they intended to run the simulation and then discovered some difficulties (that's how these things tend to go), or decided not to do it because it would be too expensive, or if they're even still working on it.",1594722152,QuantumComputing,Strilanc,Quantum,Comment,80

4913,"Grover's algorithm is only a quadratic speedup. I didn't give an outlook besides pointing out that the connections were not warranted. Quantum many-body phenomena, if you mean molecular simulation, is again not within near term capabilities for useful problems, There is strong interest in that particular area, just as in others like optimizations because they have some potential for industrial use, not simply an interest for scientific community.   If you mean other many-body phenomena, you will have to be specific. 

IBM's blog says:

""For instance, once computed classically, the full state vector can be  accessed arbitrarily many times. The runtime of our simulation method  scales approximately linearly with the circuit depth (see Figure 1  above), imposing no limits such as those owing to the limited coherence  times."" 

So storing the vector is not the immediate problem as what appears in your response. BTW 2\^53 and 2\^24 are only a factor of 2 apart, not a factor of 10 (which is what 10\^15 and 10\^16 are).

My comment on Google having to only add a few qubits does not have anything to do with speedups. It's just that when IBM simulates the quantum system they have to store the wave function in memory, apply the gates etc. Google's current machine has 53 qubits so simulating it classically requires to store a 2\^53 (\~10\^15) long vector, going to 54 qubits requires 2\^54 entries (10\~16) so one order of magnitude more. 

I'm not saying IBM is not able to simulate 54 qubits, but you understand that at some point you reach current classical hardware capabilities.

Your statement ""all Google has to do is add one or two qubits and it’s again out of  reach for classical machines since the Hilberspace scales exponentially"", is premised on the idea that size of Hilbert space automatically translates to speedups.

4981,"Sure thing! I'll use x instead of theta, since it's easier to type.

By differentiating the function we were given f(x)= (1/M\^2) sin\^2(Mx)/sin\^2(x) with respect to x and setting the derivative to zero, we can see that as x goes to x=0, then f(x) approaches a maximum, and also that f(x) has minima at x=±π/M, with no extrema between x=0 and x=±π/M. Since f(x) is also continuous everywhere in –π/M &lt; x &lt; 0 and in 0 &lt; x &lt; π/M, we then know that f(x) strictly decreases as we go from x=0 to x=±π/M.

Clearly, |π/(2M)| &lt; |π/M| for M ≥ 1. This means that if we can show that f(x) ≥ 4/π\^2 for x = ±π/(2M), then it must be the case that f(x) ≥ 4/π\^2 for |x|≤ π/(2M), since the previously discussed outwardly decreasing behavior of f(x) on this domain means that f(x) for x smaller in magnitude than π/(2M) will necessarily be greater than or equal to f(x) at |x|=π/(2M).

We see that f(x=π/2M) = (1/M\^2) sin\^2(π/2)/sin\^2(π/(2M))) = 1/(M\^2 sin\^2(π/(2M)))

Now we need to prove that 1/(M\^2 sin\^2(π/(2M))) ≥ 4/π\^2.

Rearranging,

π\^2 ≥ 4 M\^2 sin\^2(π/(2M))

To show that this is the case, I proved that the maximum of the RHS is smaller than the LHS. To find that maximum we differentiate 4 M\^2 sin\^2(π/(2M)) with respect to M and set the derivative to zero. Doing so gives us the condition tan(π/(2M)) = π/(2M). Consider a right triangle which has an angle π/2M, and let the leg opposite that angle have length π whilst the leg adjacent has length 2M. This satisfies tan(π/(2M)) = π/(2M). Then, the hypotenuse of this triangle would be sqrt(π\^2 + 4M\^2), and the sine of π/(2M) would therefore be sin(π/(2M)) = π/sqrt(π\^2 + 4M\^2). Plugging this into the above expression

π\^2 ≥ 4M\^2 π\^2 / (π\^2 + 4M\^2)

π\^2 + 4M\^2 ≥ 4M\^2

π\^2 ≥ 0

which is obviously correct.

Hence f(x) for |x| = π/(2M) is greater than or equal to 4/π\^2 for all M ≥ 1 and hence so too is f(x) for |x| ≤ π/(2M).",1594455804,QuantumComputing,No-Time_Toulouse,Quantum,Comment,347

And while it's pretty clear that you don't actually know what ""gates"" are, I will mention that it's also pretty counterproductive to include more than four or five gates in your computing scheme, as it adds unnecessary complexity.

You clearly have interest in the subject and an ability to direct some amount of focus towards such a thing.

Even one bank getting this before other people can figure out how to make it safe could be destructive.

&amp;#x200B;

You're right about my attitude. I don't know how to interact well with people. It's my problem and I'm trying to work on it.

Here's my real opinion of this: My theory has explained something none of you can understand just yet. But as soon as I'm able to tell you about it without fear, you'll understand it and immediately go back to being smarter than I am. I don't care about that at all. At that point, whatever you guys produce I can also understand.

I know you're all smarter than I am for myriad reasons and I'm okay with that. I want to protect myself and my information before I screw up and hurt people by revealing something I didn't realize was just the right phrase or term some scientists needed to see before going, ""oh snap, I know what this guy sees! Time to make war bombs and murder toys.""",1594153107,QuantumComputing,LightColorTheory,Quantum,Comment,241
5063,No. If you use an annealer the overhead is N^4. This means for N towns you need a huge amount of analog qubits. Digital quantum is not better as it is in the tiny phase. ClassicAl heuristics like LK get you a close go optimal solution super fast for thousands of towns.

5065,"Sorry, I think I posted a little too early. I was making some shelves for my wife and went through how my language plotting should carry over elsewhere. I started thinking about math and realized in quantum you guys are already working on my cycle, but I didn't know how to spot it.

Quantum theory works in PEMDAS but reverse. First gate is subtract, second adds, third divides, second layer is achieved by multiplying, additional strength gets calculated with exponents, then additional notation for the third cycle will begin at the parenthetical gate but if there's nothing there, the gate is closed and the equation can complete on level 2 through all of those operations. You won't need to do second layer unless you have to do something more complicated than subtraction, addition, or division. This is probably closest to binary operational work.

Level 2 introduces multiplication, exponents, and parenthesis. I'm not very familiar with higher maths so I'll have to figure out what the next six parameters can be for tertiary scale. But at level 2 we're already working in qutrits so my logic doesn't need to extend there just yet.

&amp;#x200B;

First layer achieves the first level of speed notation. Second layer works out height. Third is distance.

Or, in radio waves this is Rate, Volume, Frequency.

The first level is calculating how fast this information needs to be processed and whether it will need to be more complicated than simple qubit groupings which might be where qutrits become necessary rather than optional?

If so, The first layer to step your equation is something like this:

Signal is E. Gate 1 is Green. Gate 2 is Red. Gate 3 is Blue.

E-G+R+B or (1)(-1)(+1)(/2)

This equals 1. Full and correct signal response.

Level two is where qutrits become necessary. The superstate of 2 begins at Gate 1, Level 2.

&amp;#x200B;

However, at the completion of cycle 1 here is where we are:

Whatever your first gate is can be the solution if necessary. This is if nothing needs to be transmitted, nothing is transmitted and there is no error about it. That's Volume. Volume 0 is okay.

Volume = Volume(Green-Red+Blue)

when that gets processed as a light signal, we add the exponent.

Volume=Volume(Green-Red+Blue)C\^2. That's one output rate of quantum calculation in my architecture at level one through three gates. My full architecture uses two processors that entangle, so it will be four times as efficient even on layer one. exponential growth on two, and maybe time travel on three?

A: When we started the work, only publications (e.g., [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08584](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08584)) and media articles were about toy problems or very simplistic approaches.  We had a member of the team for a while do this for ORNL, and could not do 20 assets on the same D-Wave box.  Lee Braine is quoted with the 'toy' line.  JPMC's head of QC kept talking about initializing qubits in his videos, and did cool complex number drawings.

One of the vendors I like who did this for fixed income had just stopped being on grant money life support.  Pals of mine in the biz at conferences hint and wink knowingly about portfolio optimization, but nobody shared anything concrete.

The large firms / government entities we spoke with were interested, but not doing this either, outside of secure communications.

So, we took it on...",1594136571,QuantumComputing,Chicago_Quantum,Quantum,Comment,169
5081,"I am an author.  Here is the paper in arXiv:  [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01430](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01430)

I can see advantage coming, but not in this paper.  Portfolio optimization with a 40 stock universe.  When we hit 60 stocks, or 2\^60 portfolios to analyze, then 80 stocks, or 2\^80, the race gets more interesting.

The economic logic: most &lt;$500k individual investors that buy and hold (think 401K or passive investors) would benefit from picking/rebalancing a stock portfolio to get lower volatility in returns for a level of expected returns.  Less up and down if we pick stocks based on covariance.  Individual investors don't have the ability to do this.  They read articles from pros (I tweet these occasionally).  Adding in fixed income (bonds), currencies, commodities, and real estate would make this exceptionally cool, but the math is different and will take time to work through.

Tl;Dr Genetic Algorithm did better, faster when seeded randomly, and seeded with D-Wave portfolios did even faster.  Simulated annealer feeding genetic algorithm should do even better (next paper will have it).  Brute force takes too long.  Random sampling got close, but takes way longer.  


The innovations:  1) We took a ratio (think Sharpe ratio, a/b) and reformulated to a linear equation (think c-d) that gives good answers, and fits into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) matrix that D-Wave uses as input.  The D-Wave was accurate and better than average (mostly) at picking portfolios.  2) We also figured out how to build the matrices (NxNxN) to keep the problem a QUBO and apply affine transformations and scaling so D-Wave can find the answers/energies we want it to find.

5108,"What we try to achieve in boson sampling is ""just"" drawing samples from the output distribution that is close to the ideal output distribution (which is related to the permanent of the matrix). Note that \*reconstructing\* the probability distribution or at least that verify that it is close to the ideal distribution is a different (albeit very important) task. If the circuit is treated as a black box, the latter task [is infeasible in general](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01023).

This may seem like a strange notion of a ""task"", but a quantum supremacy task  is designed specifically to be easy for a quantum computer (or in this case the linear optical circuit and the ability to prepare and count photons). Drawing samples from the output distribution is a natural thing that you can do to any quantum computer. The theoretical part of quantum supremacy is then to argue that such a task is impossible (cannot be done efficiently asymptotically) without the help of any quantum device. This is where the permanent comes in for this specific example of boson sampling. 

Since the argument is complexity-theoretic, any explanation of how the argument works will be filled with computer science jargons. Having said that, I'll try to give a rough rundown of the argument without exactly explaining the jargons and you can tell me any specific point you'd like to hear more. Basically, computational complexity tries to map out mathematical problems in terms of their algorithmic complexity. When you hear something like ""complexity class P is contained in NP"". This means that algorithms that can  solve problems in P are generally not known to be able to solve all problems in NP. Now P and NP are just the zeroth and first level of the [polynomial hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_hierarchy) (PH). On the one hand, exactly calculating *classical* probabilities is (in the worst case) a very hard problem; it is above the infinite level of the PH, while approximating them is in the third level of the PH. On the other hand, exactly calculating output probabilities of quantum computers is about as hard as the classical case. The crucial point, however, is that approximating them remains above the infinite level of the PH. What Aaronson and Arkhipov figured out in their boson sampling proposal is that, up to some mathematical conjectures, if you have a classical machine that can sample from a distribution close to the ideal quantum output distribution, then you can use an algorithm in the third level of the PH to approximate the quantum output distributions, thus solving a problem above the infinite level of the PH. In other words, the supposedly infinite PH ""collapses"" to the third level, which is a weaker form of the statement ""P = NP"" which computer scientists don't believe. If the conclusion of the argument (collapse of the PH) is false, then the assumption that we have such a classical sampling machine must be false. The permanent you can think of as just a specific hard problem that makes the proof tractable. (Note that if you replace bosons by fermions, then the permanent becomes the determinant, which is easy to calculate and so the whole argument doesn't work.)",1594033214,QuantumComputing,WhataBeautifulPodunk,Quantum,Comment,528

&gt; The trick is to take it one step at a time, because it isn't really possible to learn everything.

&gt; You start by mastering the use of the `hjkl` keys, which keep your hands on the home row and will get you most of the way with any vimlike application.
&gt; 
&gt; Then you start incorporating more advanced movements, so you don't hold down `hjkl` to get to the target. movements like `f`ind, `t`o, `a`round, and then adding numbers, like `5dd` to delete 5 lines.

&gt; Then the basic editing like deleting lines, changing words/paragraphs, copying/pasting, etc.

5163,"While quantum computers *leverage* quantum physics to perform computations that no classical computer can perform (at the same time/energy scale), the *interface* to every quantum computer is classical. That includes both the inputs and the outputs. That means that we need to clearly delineate the part of the quantum computer that is actually quantum (the isolated, prepared qubits) and the part of it that is classical (the state-excitation and measurement equipment).

[Start here](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/heres-a-blueprint-for-a-practical-quantum-computer) to get an rough grasp on the overall concept of what typical NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) hardware can look like. Remember that qubits can be built out of almost any physical phenomenon that exhibits quantum behavior, whether laser light, electron spin, and so on. While we call them ""qubits"" by analogy to digital bits, each qubit is better thought of as an analog system. It is *not* analog (because it is not classical) but the last layer that interfaces to the qubits themselves will always consist of high-accuracy, highly-tuned analog devices. These devices can be divided into ""control"" and ""readout"". The control devices are what prepare the states of the qubits. The readout devices are what read out the measured states of the qubits.

In a simple example, the quantum circuit that is executed by the quantum computer will consist of the prepared state (and nothing else). Since a quantum system evolves in time, there is some time-delay between the preparation and the readout. That time delay is encoded into the control circuits that control the analog control and readout devices. The simplest imaginable case is an identity gate which just does nothing but pass the prepared state through, unchanged. In that case, the only time delay is the time required for the control device to prepare the qubit states. To avoid bad data, the readout device must measure the state of the qubits within the minimum decoherence time.

In the case of a [CNOT](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22]]}), the ""result"" of the quantum computation is, in principle, already encoded into the prepared state (the left side of a quantum circuit diagram, see link above). The quantum gates are constructed by physical entanglement of the qubit states by the control device. In my non-expert imagination, I think of this a little bit like tuning radios to the same band. Each group of qubits that is entangled in the computation must be ""tuned"" to each other so that they will operate in a gang. So, the ""initial state"" of the quantum circuit is prepared and the physical entanglement of the qubits is driven by the analog control device. Now that the circuit is ""encoded"" onto the qubits, there is some (circuit-dependent) time-delay after which the readout device must fire a measurement. This must all occur within the minimum decoherence time or the entire computation will just reduce to white-noise.",1593843061,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,467

5181,"The are measure is the unique, **uniform** probability measure over the **unitary group**, which is the group describing the evolution of any quantum system (this is the second axiom of quantum mechanics).

In words, it is uniform in the sense that any ""area"" (more precisely, Borel set) of the unitary group will keep the same measure when translated by a left- or right action. Let us make an analogy. Imagine that you ave a piece of paper and you draw an area on it. A probability measure will assign a number from 0 to 1 to this area. Then you shift this area in another location of the paper, keeping its shape. If the measure is uniform, this shifted area will keep the same value as before. In our case, the piece of paper is the unitary group, the area is any Borel set, and the translation is done by left- or right group action.

Now, a unitary k-design is a distribution over the unitary group, which can be discrete like a set of quantum gates, whose first k moments exactly matches the first k moments of the Haar measure. That is, a unitary design can in some way act like the uniform Haar measure. The best known unitary 3-design is the Clifford group, that is, the *normalizer* of the Pauli group.

For quantum algorithms, [this blog is mandatory reading](algorithmicassertions.com/). Craig is often present in this very subreddit and is probably reading this right now. Hi Craig! The other bit of mandatory reading is [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/). By mandatory reading I mean his prepared lecture material, his research per se, and his blog (in no particular order).  

If you're starting from a CS background my advice to you is to implement a quantum computer simulation for yourself. Obviously you can't simulate a large quantum computer with a classical one as otherwise we would not need quantum computers. However even your smartphone should be able to simulate a ~20 qubit machine. The first time I did this it took me under 100 lines in python. You have not understood quantum computing until you can take a circuit diagram and make your simulated quantum computer execute it.",1593743665,QuantumComputing,IIAOPSW,Quantum,Comment,303
5193,"General answer: An ansatz is an ""initial guess"" as to what the final answer might be. For example when solving the equation of motion for the harmonic oscillator.

In the context of quantum mechanics: Ansatz is usually used when referring to the trial wavefunction when you're talking about the variational principle in QM. The trial wavefunction is parameterized by some parameters which you want to find so that your wavefunction minimizes the expectation value of your Hamiltonian.

This is similar to the general answer above because your trial wavefunction is sort of an ""initial guess"" which you can then adjust accordingly so that you minimize your energy.

In the context of quantum optimization in quantum computing: From the variational principle above, you need a trial wavefunction which you then adjust according to some variational parameters. In quantum optimization, the trial wavefunction is prepared by applying a unitary evolution to an initial wavefunction. This unitary evolution lets the trial wavefunction be parameterized, and the goal is to find the optimal parameters of this unitary evolution.

Depending on the type of hardware and problem you have, you can have something called a ""hardware efficient"" ansatz (e.g. a circuit comprising of rotation gates, CNOTs, etc), or a ""physically motivated"" ansatz (e.g. UCCSD).",1593740598,QuantumComputing,SufficientSet,Quantum,Comment,209

The host computer can still take advantage of the calculations it has already done earlier, in fact this is a commonly used technique called caching.

Then, create within that a supercomputer that does not need to calculate the same calculations as it's host computer. Why? Because the host computer already has done those calculations and holds them. Then, the computer within is addressed for a problem, say ""how to most efficiently address global climate change in a manner that reduces human negative impact but also benefits humans to use their greed against itself.""

5210,"Adding rules to your simulation like gravity generally takes more computation resources.  In the case of simulating the building, you could assume the building won’t move instead of simulating its gravity.  This is an approximation.  It’s fine for most purposes, but there are details that are lost this way.  For example, you wouldn’t be able to capture the stresses on the building’s structures and therefore how the building would hold up in an earthquake without some simulation of gravity.


But in general, yes, physics simulations can and do make approximations.  On some level, any physics simulation must be an approximation.  And for practical purposes, you cut as many corners as you can.  A building in a video game will just be a box colored with relatively low-resolution textures, rather than a detailed simulation of the object.


The issue with making these approximations for simulating a computer is that you need a certain minimum level of detail for the computer to function.  If you skip the wrong steps, your computer will get the wrong answer.  But if you know which steps you *can* skip, you can just update your program to be more approximate/more efficient, and run that program on your physical computer.  There is nothing gained by running a simulated computer, and in fact, there is always a loss due to the overhead of running the simulation.",1593706334,QuantumComputing,Mazetron,Quantum,Comment,227

5213,"You can’t learn everything about the Empire State Building just from the internet.


Even with an incredibly powerful computer, and blue prints and high resolution photos of every inch, you will not be able to deduce the position of every microscopic scratch in the concrete, every bacteria on the floor, or the states of the atoms in the walls.  You could, with a good enough scientific model, guess at these details.  The amount of space it would take to store the state of every atom in your simulation would be astronomical.  You will run into similar issues when calculating the processing time to run your simulation.  So let’s say you simulate only one tiny piece of the building at a time.  This is a huge approximation of a tiny piece of the building, but in theory, you could do something like this.


You can simulate computers.  Computers simulate computers all the time: emulators are used to play old videogames or run older operating systems.  The software people use for designing computer chips can simulate the chips being designed.  People make working model “computers” in software such as circuit simulators or even Minecraft.


However, you fundamentally can’t simulate a computer more powerful than the one it’s running on.

You can’t simulate a computer with more memory than you already have.  If you tried to do so via physical simulation, you will discover that even the smallest mechanism for storing a bit will take more than one bit of data to describe.  For example, a single SSD cell is still made up of millions of atoms, and even one atom has a lot more than one bit of information needed to represent it.  The most efficient way to store one bit would be to store it as one bit directly on your computers memory.  But you can’t break even either, because simulating your computer also has some overhead, so you can only ever simulate a computer with less memory than you currently have.


You could try the trick with the building where you only simulate one tiny piece at a time, but by doing so you are losing the information in the memory you are not currently looking at, since you have to re-generate that memory as an approximation of what a memory chip looks like, so it doesn’t help the situation.



You run into similar issues with processing speed.  The programs used to design computer processors are capable of simulating processors on the real versions of those processors.  However, the clock speed of your virtual processor is much, much, much slower.  It can take hours to simulate nanoseconds of processor time, because each clock Rick on your virtual processor requires billions of computations on your physical processor to calculate the flow of electricity at each step in the circuit.



A lot of what makes physics and computers work is approximations and corner-cutting whenever possible.  Unfortunately, in order to perform meaningful computation, you simply cannot cut corners.  There are also emerging physics theories about fundamental limitations in the amount of information that can be stored in a given volume in space, how fast information can travel, and stuff like that.",1593697401,QuantumComputing,Mazetron,Quantum,Comment,528

In practice I think that CV computing is mostly implemented on optical QCs, and gate based computing is more on the side of the ""discrete"" hardware like superconducting circuits and trapped ion. 

The reason I would assume is that it is quite hard to manipulate the momentum and position (e.g. squeezing) on the kind of hardware designed for qubits. Fundamentally the qubit is a two-level system and the CV approach needs a continuous amount of ""levels"".

So doing CV on a system with discrete levels is probably going to be quite cumbersome.

In general, a collection of n classical bits can have 2^n possible values (in my previous examples, 2^1=2 and 2^2=4).



A single qubit can have 2 possible *measurement outcomes*.  When you measure it, you will either get a 0 or a 1.  But before you measure it, it could be in an in-between state.  In order to represent this state on paper (or on a classical computer), you would need to assign a value called a “probability amplitude” to each of the possible measurements.

Similarly, a pair of qubits has 4 possible measurements.  And in general, a collection of n qubits has 2^n possible measurements.



The “n” vs “2^n” comparison comes from writing down the state of a collection of bits or qubits on paper.

Because n bits are always in a specific, well-known state, you only need to write down the values of each bit to fully describe the state.  This is n pieces of information.


A collection of qubits can be in a state that is somewhere between all the possible measurements for that collection.  To fully represent the state of the collection of qubits, you need one “probability amplitude” for each possible measurement result, and since there are 2^n possible measurement results, there are 2^n pieces of information needed to fully describe the state.",1593684302,QuantumComputing,Mazetron,Quantum,Comment,253

5249,"I would not mix up the fact that google, amazon, and Microsoft are working on quantum to translate that anything will be achievable in the next decade, that will only be determined by pure scientific fact and nothing else.  The power of the quantum hype makes for great marketing.  From what I hear in the industry, these efforts by big companies are mostly written off as marketing efforts as their quantum budgets are just pennies to the overall revenue of these giants.  For example, all of the Microsoft stores in malls came out of their marketing budget, they didn’t expect them to be a real source of revenue.

Max-cut is an nice toy problem to look at but it has no resemblance to a real industrially relevant problem.  Any solution found to accelerate max-cut will likely have zero impact on an industrially relevant problem.  I have heard and understand why quantum companies do not go after TSP or other classical optimization problems (which are used in industry daily).   If we accept that quantum computers will never compete with classical methods on these famous problems, then the next question the industry should ask is what optimization problems is out there that justifies the massive financial investment?

The answer I often hear is materials and chemistry simulations.  But the problem with this line of thinking is that our chemistry models are not perfect and are still being developed (for example density functional theory has a long road before it is more useful).  An even harder challenge is matching simulations to experiment, which opens up another can of worms.  There is no clear road here for when/how quantum computers will have a real impact.

In the end, I am rooting for quantum computers and I want to see if succeed.  But no matter how I look at it, there are decades of developments on every front, from hardware, to algorithms, to end applications.  I personally think it belongs in government research, academia, and massive companies who can afford many decades of loss.

5251,"If it was complete bullshit, Amazon and google never dived in. Of course, we don't expect to solve a difficult optimization problem using quantum computers very fast within a decade. Instead, people have found (and are still finding) a class of problem that near term quantum devices can solve efficiently than classical computers. These research area, often dubbed as NISQ that stands for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum, is where the real hype is going. One of the examples is quantum chemistry applications. I expect that quantum computers beat classical machines for this type of problem within two decades.

In addition, I would say TSP is not a good example to compare the performance between quantum and classical computers. Anyway, it is NP-hard, and most of the instances seem like be solved efficiently in classical computers as the heuristic algorithms have been improved more than 3 decades. Compared to that, quantum algorithm for this problem is not yet studied much. For combinatory problems, quantum computer scientists study random MAX-CUT problems to see whether it is possible to beat the classical limit using quantum computers.

5257,"For me quantum computing is a part of a kind of ""next generation"" of quantum technologies, loosely defined as systems that can manipulate or sense single quantum states (single photons, single magnetic field lines, spin, etc.).

I've seen a break down of this ""next generation"" as something along the lines of:

1. Quantum Sensing
2. Quantum Information
3. Quantum Simulation
4. Quantum Computing

and in that order they will (probably) become available commercially. Both quantum sensing and quantum communication are already available today for commercial applications, and both are important for the implementation of quantum computing in the end. So any improvement here can have an almost immediate commercial interest.

In the media or other public communication I guess most of these can be called ""Quantum (computer) startups"" to some extent.

Now for the last two entries in the list, quantum simulation and computation. The difference between these two is kind of arbitrary but I would argue that the breaking point will probably be error corrected qubits, i.e. logical qubits. Until then we are stuck with these noisy qubits that can't perform things like Shor's algorithm, but can be used for certain types of ""simulations"" of certain systems.

This last part is kind of what Google did in their experiment, they made a simulation on a quantum simulator that could approximate the statistical behavior of another quantum mechanical system, this you cannot do on your laptop. However, as you say in your post, this is not a problem of commercial interest.

The ""easiest"" commercial problems that these simulators are predicted to out-perform classical computers in are chemistry and solid state physics, as well as in some types of optimization problems (an advantage in optimization is not proven though). This is probably  5-10 years away, as you say. 

Building an actual logical quantum computer is probably 10-20 years into the future, but this type of hardware and algorithms will be faster and be able to solve a wider variety of problems.

I am no expert on investments, but I guess this will come down to timing the market, and the companies that are up and running and have established contacts with possible customers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               when the quantum hardware that can actually outperform classical hardware becomes available will have the advantage.",1593595633,QuantumComputing,slakeslak,Quantum,Comment,378

There's no reason to think that in 5 years the hardware won't have improved at all, and there's good reason to suspect it will have improved by a reasonable amount. A lot of quantum algorithms research has been devoted to fault tolerant fully fledged quantum computers, to motivate the development of these devices.

Quote:

Our second example today of a quantum computing motte-and-bailey is the claim, by Toronto-based quantum computing startup [Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai/), that [Gaussian BosonSampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01199) can be used to solve all sorts of graph problems, like graph isomorphism, graph similarity, and densest subgraph. As the co-inventor of [BosonSampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling), few things would warm my heart more than finding an actual application for that model (besides quantum supremacy experiments and, perhaps, certified random number generation). But I still regard this as an open problem—if by “application,” we mean outperforming what you could’ve done classically.

In papers (see for example [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10644), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12646), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10730)), members of the Xanadu team have given all sorts of ways to take a graph, and encode it into an instance of Gaussian BosonSampling, in such a way that the output distribution will then reveal features of the graph, like its isomorphism type or its dense subgraphs. The trouble is that so far, I’ve seen no indications that this will actually lead to quantum algorithms that outperform the best classical algorithms, for any graph problems of practical interest.

In the case of Densest Subgraph, the Xanadu folks use the output of a Gaussian BosonSampler to seed (that is, provide an initial guess for) a classical local search algorithm. They say they observe better results this way than if they seed that classical local search algorithm with completely random initial conditions. But of course, the real question is: could we get equally good results by seeding with the output of some *classical* heuristic? Or by solving Densest Subgraph with a different approach entirely? Given how hard it’s turned out to be just to *verify* that the outputs of a BosonSampling device come from such a device at all, it would seem astonishing if the answer to these questions wasn’t “yes.”

In the case of Graph Isomorphism, the situation is even clearer. There, the central claim made by the Xanadu folks is that given a graph G, they can use a Gaussian BosonSampling device to sample a probability distribution that encodes G’s isomorphism type. So, isn’t this “promising” for solving GI with a quantum computer? All you’d need to do now is invent some fast classical algorithm that could look at the samples coming from two graphs G and H, and tell you whether the probability distributions were the same.

Except, not really. While the Xanadu paper never says so, if all you want is to sample a distribution that encodes a graph’s isomorphism type, that’s easy to do classically! (I even put this on the final exam for my undergraduate Quantum Information Science course a couple weeks ago.) Here’s how: given as input a graph G, just output G but with its vertices randomly permuted. Indeed, this will even provide a further property, better than anything the BosonSampling approach has been shown to provide (or than it probably does provide): namely, if G and H are *not* isomorphic, then the two probability distributions will not only be different but will have disjoint supports. Alas, this still leaves us with the problem of distinguishing which distribution a given sample came from, which is as hard as Graph Isomorphism itself. None of these approaches, classical or quantum, seem to lead to any algorithm that’s subexponential time, let alone competitive with the [“Babai approach”](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2521) of thinking really hard about graphs.",1593559220,QuantumComputing,rrtucci,Quantum,Comment,579

Of course. The back of an eye is basically a photosensitive screen. And for all intents and purposes the screen is *already* an observer. It performs a position measurement on the incoming photons.

The main issue you will run into is that if the photons are being sent one by one, to ensure they are interfering with themselves instead of each other, one photon hitting your eye is so faint that you'll have trouble seeing anything at all.

5301,"From a computer science perspective, a quantum computer can do anything a classical computer can do so it can never be the case that a classical machine uses an algorithm that is fundamentally unavailable to a quantum computer. So classical machines can never asymptotically outclass quantum machines at anything.

From an engineering perspective, classical machines are always going to be cheaper and faster because they have fewer design constraints. Currently, it would be reasonable to expect running a classical algorithm on a quantum machine to be *at least* a billion times more expensive than running the same thing on a classical machine. For example, on my laptop, performing a 2048 bit modular exponentiation takes less than a second whereas, for a quantum computer, I estimate [it would take several hours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749) to do the same operation (although this is a bit high since it assumes coherence must be maintained in the quantum case). That projected ratio will go down as physical qubits improve and error correction techniques improve, but it will never reach parity.

For a given problem, the question will come down to whether or not using a quantum algorithm save enough operations to overcome the disadvantage of using a slower machine. Currently, to my eyes, it looks like quantum algorithms with quadratic speedups (e.g. unstructured search) aren't good enough to overcome the initial penalty but quantum algorithms with exponential speedups (e.g. factoring) are.",1593452622,QuantumComputing,Strilanc,Quantum,Comment,234

5401,"As far as I'm concerned, Scott Aaronson perfectly sums up the matter in [this episode of the AI podcast.](https://lexfridman.com/scott-aaronson/) Paraphrasing from memory, so forgive inevitable inaccuracies and imprecision. 

Designing a classical computer algorithm can be a fairly intuitive process. We design algorithms which move from state to state via logical connections. In many ways, we mimic our cognitive problem-solving abilities. 

Designing quantum algorithms requires a very different approach. You apply a series of unitary transformations to affect the state of a quantum system. An effective quantum algorithm for some problem succeeds by amplifying the probability of measuring states that correspond to solutions (while at the same time diminishing the probability of measuring states that lead to wrong answers). Effectively, you want to shape the space of possible outcomes to suit your needs.

Here's a rough analogy that helps me keep the difference straight in my head. Imagine you're dropped at the entrance of a maze. If I asked you to find a path through the maze, you'd probably try some sort of randomized-DFS. After exploring enough hallways, you'll probably succeed. That's a ""classical"" approach to solving the problem.

Analogically speaking, a ""quantum"" approach would look something like this. You notice a control panel next to the entrance. If you fiddle with the controls, you hear things happening in the maze, but you can't see what exactly is happening. Turns out, if you're clever enough with the control panel, you can close most/all openings in the maze that lead to a dead-end. Then, when you enter the maze, you'll find the solution immediately.

If you want the full, accurate articulation, I recommend listening to the podcast. It's also an excellent introduction to the field, imo. Best of luck with QCQI!",1593055236,QuantumComputing,TWalen,Quantum,Comment,289

5409,"My favorite example for this is Grover search, imagine trying to find a single ball placed into a bucket with a bunch of other empty buckets, all lined up. Your goal is to find out which bucket has the ball. Classically, what you do is check each bucket, starting with the first one, and if it is empty then you move on to the next one. If you want to get fancy you could even do random checking, where you pick a random bucket, check it, and move to another random one if it's empty. Both methods have the same performance, and that is half the time your going to have to check at least half the buckets. There is no way around this fact. If you double the total number of buckets, you have to check twice as many. However, if the buckets were quantum mechanical states, a quantum computer could find the special bucket in square root time. So if you have 100 buckets, it would only need to ""check"" about 10 times and it would find it guaranteed (I'm ignoring constant factors, sqrt is asymptotic performance). It is absurd to think that a classical system, in this example a person checking a bucket, could get this kind of performance. In fact it's impossible to guarantee it, even in expectation with random checking. So in order to think how a quantum computer can achieve that performance you have to go to mathematical reasoning a lot of the time and be aware if you're falling in to classical reasoning (i.e when analyzing grover search you can't really think of the quantum computer as a person checking buckets, it's not going to work).

Why does my output, when looking at the logic, show (b,a) as the end result?",1593039011,QuantumComputing,AlchemisTree,Quantum,Comment,57
5413,"I think this relates, at least in part, to the issue of language. We use an imprecise, but intuitive, language to discuss the world around us. We use words like particles and waves. We think we know what they mean and how things described in that way should act. But these words were born from classical physics. And we tried to shoe horn them into quantum physics to fit our needs. 

This is not a new observation. In 1935, Max Born wrote:  “The ultimate origin of the difficulty lies in the fact (or philosophical principle) that we are compelled to use the words of common language when we wish to describe a phenomenon, not by logical or mathematical analysis, but by a picture appealing to the imagination. Common language has grown by everyday experience and can never surpass these limits.” (See page 97 of Born's, ""Atomic Physics,"" here:  [https://archive.org/details/AtomicPhysics8th.ed.](https://archive.org/details/AtomicPhysics8th.ed.) )

Anyway, take that concept of language and the intuition we have for what certain classical objects and expand it into the realm of computer science. We use words like bits and gates. It's easy to what to use your intuition to think about qubits and quantum gates using in a similar way using that classical intuition. But you should not get sucked in to taking that intuition too far.

So, I am sure the folks here can come up with better examples, but to answer your question: I think the classic example is the one Born used. To think of a quantum particle as a particle (or a wave for that matter) is erroneous and limits your ability to fully understand what is happening to a ""particle."" 

Another example may be entanglement generally. It is difficult, I think, to fully understand and have good intuition about what certain types of multi-qubit entanglement looks like and how it acts. It can be tempting to use your intuition about classical correlations to help understand. But you would be limiting yourself if you take that intuition too far.",1593038133,QuantumComputing,Replevin4ACow,Quantum,Comment,335

Input x get y. A simple set of instructions. They are mostly deterministic too. Quanten algorithms in hindsight (at least on the gate model based algorithms) are mostly complex mathematical operations. Also they are largely based on probability’s. All these things are hard to imagine and one would tend to simply build a classical algorithm on a quantum computer. Also the Concept of a superposition is really abstract and hard to gasp at a „algorithm design“ point of view ( at least imho)",1593037619,QuantumComputing,crest42,Quantum,Comment,119
5416,"The problem I see is largely one of public perception.  We're years from demonstrating Shor's Algorithm on a public key, and even after successful proof of concept it will be years before that will be a practical concern for any normal user.  Which is plenty of time to make sure new wallets incorporate post-quantum techniques, and update old wallets.  No problem, right?

If you still have access, that is.  Whales are a problem, at least for Bitcoin.  All those long-since-lost-to-the-mists-of-time accounts, Satoshi's original mining, and the like?  Once there is a PoC shown, suddenly those are all up in the air again.  Conceivably the old wallets with millions of BTC could be worth breaking with quantum techniques, and even if they never were broken... Would you feel comfortable assuming that would stay that way?

What if Craig S. Wright was working with Honeywell?  Or Kleiman's estate?  Or, for that matter, the courts just ordered Honeywell or Google or whoever to salvage his purported lost access for a share of the total? Suddenly the absurdity of his claims are no longer quite so funny.  The whales would be forced to surface, one way or another.  If they couldn't be shifted to a new PQC wallet, courts could just order the QC company to plug away at until it is available to be divided as the courts directed.  That case could really be a disaster...

I think there will at some point be a massive devaluation of the original cryptocurrencies as that sinks in, with newer and more adaptable blockchains being better positioned.  Ethereum seems to be getting ready, and there are a couple of altcoins already claiming to be quantum resistant.

I would be VERY surprised if N.

The best fabs in the world need to be considered here too, which is pretty transparent. MIT LL, and Global Foundry and maybe Rigetti's are the top quantum capable fabs with no one near them at all. You cannot even buy the fab equipment from any producer (i.e. AMAT, LAM or Bosch) you need to modify your own which involves a whole myriad of complications too which are truly non trivial (otherwise we'd have fault tolerent quantum computers with 100ks or millions of qubits required to run these algos. In the past 15 years we got 50. And btw itll be years before we even get to 1000....)

5458,"Raw qubit are intrinsically noisy so it’s a tricky task to ask if one quantum computer better than another purely based on the number of qubits. I.e. is a quantum computer with 5 very good qubits more useful than a quantum computer with 50 very bad qubits? It’s similar to saying a bike with 10 wheels is better than a bike with 2 wheels. At the end of the day you care about how far you can get on the bike, not the number of wheels it has. The quantum volume is kind of asking how far can you get on your bike with the number wheels you have. If the answer is 2 wheels and two miles you have a quantum volume of 2^2. If you have a better bike with 10 wheels that allows you to bike 10 miles then you have a quantum volume of 2^10. If you have 10 crappy wheels and can still only get 2 miles you have still have a quantum volume of 2^2 because the QV asks what is the minimum of the two. Of course this is a rough analogy bc quantumly one can only access certain parts of the computational space with more qubits. 

At a more technical level what the quantum volume tells you is what is the largest “square” (n qubits x n SU(4) operations between arbitrary qubit pairs) circuit a quantum computer can run with a high success rate. The operations have to be done between arbitrary qubits so the metric doesn’t really favor any one architecture over the other though architectures with high connectivity like trapped ions can have an advantage.

5480,"I'd consider a (pure) qubit to be described by 2 real numbers, actually.  You can describe the states as two complex numbers (one for each basis state), but in addition to the global phase being irrelevant, the magnitude squared of each of these must add to one.  This can readily be exhibited with the Bloch-sphere picture, where pure qubits live on the surface, and latitude and longitude are all you need.  Impure qubits extend this to the interior, and require another real parameter.

&gt; That spin of an electron has more parameters than angular momentum with 3 real number parameters?

Nope!  One less, because magnitude of electron spin is fixed to h-bar/2.

&gt; but I now understand it that global phase matters if we have a gate on two qubits with differing global phases. I assume the intuition is that if we consider two qubits, their ""global phases"" will be relative to each other, thus they are a ""relative"" phase.

Kind of, but not really.  When combined, those phases aren't relative to each other, but neither are they distinguishable. For any ""system"" there is one global phase: what you can multiply all the basis phases by and still end up with the same possible measurements.  Altering the global phase of ""one part"" is altering the entire global phase.  This can be seen by the fact that combining two systems with N and M basis states gives N*M basis states.  It maps products of basis phases to basis phases, and afterward there is again one irrelevant global phase.

In general for a pure N state system, there are 2 * N - 2 independent real parameters: the N complex numbers, but constrained by magnitude-squaring to one, and by one global phase that can be ignored.  For n gubits, this is 2 * (2^n - 1).",1592808439,QuantumComputing,wnoise,Quantum,Comment,304

(a + bi)|0&gt; + (c+ di)|1&gt;

Where a,b,c,d are real numbers. These are the four real numbers that determine the qubit. 

By the way, if we ignore the global phase, then we can multiply by the phase of (a+bi) to get a sort of ""normal form"" where the first complex number is always real and therefore, ignoring global phase, the qubit is described by

r |0&gt; + (c+di) |1&gt;

Where r,c,d are real numbers - therefore, you only need 3 real numbers to describe it without the phase. 

As to spin vs. angular momentum - I don't think that it is the case that angular momentum is described by 3 real number parameters. I think it is actually infinitely many, if I recall correctly (this is of course quantum-mechanical angular momentum).

First, the video is obviously by a crackpot. For example, one minute in it claims their company broke RSA 2048 in the 1990s. This would be trivial to demonstrate, but they haven't. For example, you could factor the RSA challenge numbers and publish the factors. Or you could sign a message saying ""RSA is broken"" with the public keys of several different companies.

At 7:40 it says quantum computing requires all-to-all connectivity. That's wrong. Fault tolerant quantum computation [only requires local connectivity on a 2d grid](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2106/what-is-surface-code-quantum-error-correction).

The table at 15:30 has obvious calculation errors in the rightmost column. For starters, it's combining logical error rates with physical qubits counts, instead of logical qubit counts, which will inflate the error rate by 1000x. Even allowing for that, it's still clearly wrong. For example, in the before-last row it gives a per-op-per-qubit error rate of 10^(-11) and says there are 10^5 qubits and 10^8 operations. The chance of no error during a computation is then approximately 10^(11-5-8)=10^(-2)=1%, but the table is saying the chance of no error is way *way* lower than that. The other misleading thing about this table is that its logical error rates start at a ridiculously huge 1%, instead of at more appropriate target error rates like 10^(-12). 1% would be typical of physical error rates, not logical error rates after error correction.",1592779448,QuantumComputing,Strilanc,Quantum,Comment,248

Yes, but the problem is, IBM's QEC wrecks the output on actual IBM-Q hardware. Which makes no sense. For example, whenever a cosmic ray hits an ECC stick of memory and flips a bit, ECC fixes the flipped bit and corresponding error.

That is not happening with IBM-Q. And in fact, whenever you show their engineers the disparity between the IBM-Q simulator and IBM-Q qubits, they then even go so far as to say it's QEC that's biasing the output. Makes no sense.

The main upside to the time that we are currently living in is an amazingly fast technology development. Quantum computers will need time to improve both in terms of errors and quantum volume. The first thing that can be called a programmable computer was the Analytical Engine designed by Charles Babbage. It was in **1837**. Since then we had people like Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Herman Hollerith and many more, who probably never thought that computers will take over the world as much as they did.

Does that mean that we should stop doing the research in QC because someone says it doesn't make sense? Albert Einstein didn't believe in quantum physics, was it a good enough argument to drop the research about it? Of course not. Look at what we know now about this topic.

I think that we shouldn't drop the research just yet. We are still making inroads in this field and didn't hit the ceiling.

A better analogy: qiskit is like C, Silq is like Prolog. Prolog does a lot of things behind the user's back, and never caught on, except in academic circles. 

Moving to a higher level language is not always a good thing or ""more intuitive"". Being more succinct is not the same as being more intuitive. Often, moving to a higher level of abstraction makes things more general but  less intuitive.

The same is true of all that paper. As far as I can see, you never show explicitly how it would be done by qiskit. Then you end up concluding that you are much more ""intuitive"" than qiskit.

How do you know that the type of maths and physics used in QML would be more interesting to you than say conventional quantum algorithm design, or designing Bose-Einstein condensate-based sensing devices? The impression you have of a field as a layperson is very different to what it is to work in this field every day, and there are a thousand other fields you have never heard of that you might also love to work in.

The best thing to do is to have a general goal, but at the same time keep an open mind. There will be some areas of mathematics that appeal to you more than others, and you won't know until you've tried them. In fact you may hate some areas the first time you see them, only to find a beauty in them when you come back with a bit more mathematical maturity.

So my advice would be to focus on the fundamentals, things that can serve you in a variety of fields (which basically means maths), and try a lot of things out along the way.

Using the rules of quantum mechanics, we can explain how different physical phenomena work and predict how they will behave.

But, just because we know how the universe behaves, that doesn't mean we know how to make it useful for us.

5626,"Quantum supremacy was never reached. The authors were simply excited that they were able to do portfolio optimization on a d-wave system. 

For those that don’t know portfolio optimization simply takes the number of desired assets in the portfolio, then tweaks the weights of each one within the portfolio to maximise their historic return and minimize their historic volatility. On classical computing this operation is done through guessing and checking different weights for each of the 40 until it’s (basically) checked them all. 

Where quantum comes in is being able to immediately assume the correct weights for all 40 stocks immediately, this kind of computation is extremely valuable for funds with 1000’s of stocks in their portfolio. Although it is barely used because it is a pretty archaic way of valuing a stock portfolio. 

The last point I want to make is that if you look at any resource talking about the application of quantum in finance, portfolio optimization is at the top of that list, so what I can’t understand is why the authors thought this feat remarkable when it is the first thing that financiers do when they get their hands on quantum computers.

I think that a good way to think about it, is to realize that states define the configuration of a quantum system only up to a *global phase.* If you multiply a state by a (complex) scalar of magnitude 1, it won't change the expectation value of any observable, so we think of this (different) vector as representing the same state of the physical system (in other words, our description of quantum mechanics using vectors in Hilbert spaces is a bit redundant).

Mathematically speaking, a quantum system is represented by a (complex) *line*, not by a vector, so the actual space of possible configurations of a qubit is a *one-dimensional (complex) projective line* (since the projective space is exactly the collection of lines in a vector space).

In a sense, the qubit is thus one-dimensional. The zero-dimensional projective space you would obtain from a 1-dimensional complex space (i.e., only a phase) is pretty boring.",1591725514,QuantumComputing,anlucia,Quantum,Comment,187
5749,"I'm an undergrad who has been working with a research group for 2 years. Here's my take that should be taken with a grain of salt(and maybe some pepper too):

No knows what methods will be standardized for quantum computing. My group goes over 2 papers a week explaining different methods of quantum memories, quantum networks, ect. Some use trapped ions others use photonics. A background in physics will help you understand different topics. Right now companies are looking for people who know what methods to use given a certain goal. People to build that system. And people to analyze the system to make sure it worked correctly. For a company to hire someone dedicated to programming quantum ""computers"" they would have already established a complete quantum system and developed a language to tell the quantum ""computer"" what to do. Or companies are investing their resources to simulate a quantum computer and are hiring people to develop software with it. (Can't confirm people are actually doing this). 

Bottom line is this industry is going to be competitive. So you gotta show the companies you're in it. Big companies like IBM have open source projects you can work on to gain their attention. I would recommend playing around with some and make something you are proud of. The other bit of advice is to read research papers. You'll want to be up to date on current methods and trade offs. For example if someone makes a new algorithm that requires a quantum memory that can hold a qubit for a long time, they need to know the decoherence of current long term quantum memories.",1591724310,QuantumComputing,Smallz1107,Quantum,Comment,273

I'd say that about half of the startup I work for does not have a degree in physics, but they are all doing very valuable work. 

I think this ultimately goes back to the difference between the industry that your workplace is in versus the job role that you would be taking on.

I mean that in the sense that there aren't many people with 10 years + of QC specific experience that is broadly relevant. The platform is undecided at a level analogous to picking silicon as the base of the modern computing industry. The levels of abstraction have not been standardized. That also means that the skills needed for QC specific work have not been standardized, and that there aren't well established career pathways.  


This, unfortunately, means that for folks working directly on QC there is a desire for sufficient relevant credentials that inspire confidence working in that relatively unspecified environment, or least hyper specific credentials to a particular kind of work (such as quantum algorithms or a particular qubit platform).  


However, there are positions in the industry which are not, strictly speaking, working on QC. There are folks with backgrounds in software working in other parts of the stack like instrument controls, user facing tools, or QA. The same goes for physics/engineering and working on various supporting instruments. For that type of position, any interest or background you have in quantum physics would be an additional asset.

We also hire far more summer students and interns, who don’t need specific skills going into it. 

There are definitely companies geared towards consumers that are actively hiring. I can’t really speak as to the roles they have but from the talks I’ve been to, they’re all still quite undeveloped. They have lots of funding as well but from what I can tell, they tend to stick with a smaller group of specialists.

5788,"Your question is difficult because the interpretation of ""physical"" differences begins to enter the realm of philosophy of science, but I can sympathize with desiring some physical intuition on this topic so I'll try to offer what insight I can.

In essence, the ""physical manifestation"" of the sign difference shown here is that the two states you provided **will not respond the same way to the same external stimulus** (say a laser pulse in a quantum computer that represents a gate operation). For instance, applying a Hadamard gate *H* to each state gives *H*(|0&gt;+|1&gt; ) -&gt; |0&gt; and *H*(|0&gt; -|1&gt; ) -&gt; |1&gt;. Since doing the same thing to the two states doesn't give the same result, clearly the two states are physically different somehow, even if their measurement results in the same probability distribution. We call that difference a difference in phase.

But what *is* this ""phase"" physically? One usually hears mathematical descriptions to this question involving shifts of a waveform along a continuous axis. While understanding that sort of description is vital to making use of phase and physically meaningful in its own right, I'll try forming an analog to a concept you may be more comfortable with in the hopes of giving a more general physical interpretation.

Ultimately, the phase of quantum states can be considered as reflecting just another fundamental, physical degree of freedom that exists in our world (not unlike the sign of electric charge) that we use to predict how a system will evolve as opposed to another similar system. For example, consider a system of one charged fermion, *f*. Much like measuring the two states you provided would result in the same physical result (or rather the same probability distribution), measuring the magnitude of *f*'s charge would yield the same result (1u of charge) whether it is a positron or electron. Similarly, just like the difference in phase of your two states dictates what final state I get after applying a Hadamard gate, the sign of *f*'s charge will dictate which direction it will go when I put it in a given electric field. Thus, while the sign of *f*'s charge doesn't seem to reflect anything physically unique in the context of charge magnitude, it *does* reflect a difference in how the system will behave to external stimulus. In the same way, while the phase of the two states you offered may not seem to reflect anything physically unique upon measurement, it *does* reflect a physical difference in how the state will respond to a given gate operation.

**Quick disclaimer**: there are some significant differences between charge and phase so don't take this parallel too far; I just mean to use it here to demonstrate how the physical manifestation of phase can (if nothing else) be viewed as a statement of how the system will respond to stimulus (which while perhaps not as much of a conceptually ""physical quantity"" as something like mass, certainly does still represent something very physically meaningful). In reality, the question of what should be considered ""physical"" and what constitutes ""measurement"" at the quantum level remains a topic of some debate in both physics and philosophy of science.

However, I still don't completely get my head around how this matches with the description of the CNOT gate as ""letting the control qubit alone and flipping the target one when the control is |1&gt;"".

5811,"So the two qubits start off in the |+ ⟩ |- ⟩  state. As you know, |+ ⟩ = (|0 ⟩ +|1 ⟩ )/sqrt(2).

So we can first expand the |+ ⟩  (but keep the |- ⟩  as is) and re-write the starting state as 

|+ ⟩ |- ⟩ = (|0 ⟩ |- ⟩  + |1 ⟩ |- ⟩ )/sqrt(2).

Now recall what cNOT gate does: if the control qubit is in the |0 ⟩ state, the target qubit is unchanged, whereas if it's in the |1 ⟩  state, the target qubit has an X gate applied to it.

Now the question is what does the X gate do to the |- ⟩  state? An X gate is a bit flip, so it changes |0 ⟩  to |1 ⟩  and vice versa. So then

X|- ⟩  = X (|0 ⟩  - |1 ⟩ ) / sqrt(2) = (X|0 ⟩  - X|1 ⟩ ) / sqrt(2) = (|1 ⟩ - |0 ⟩) / sqrt(2) = -|- ⟩. 

So X|- ⟩ = -|- ⟩. Now we can think about the cNOT gate's effect on the state |+ ⟩|- ⟩.

Remember that it leaves the part of that state with the control qubit in the |0 ⟩ state unchanged, so we only need to worry about the |1 ⟩|- ⟩ component. In this case, we apply an X gate to the |- ⟩ qubit to get -|- ⟩ as above. So we can write the state AFTER the cNOT gate as

cNOT(|+ ⟩|- ⟩) = (|0 ⟩|- ⟩ - |1 ⟩|- ⟩)/sqrt(2) = (|0 ⟩ - |1 ⟩)/sqrt(2) |- ⟩ = |- ⟩|- ⟩.

When dealing with a single qubit, it's sometimes helpful to think about it as a weighted coin. You could technically store an infinite amount of information in a coin by weighting it very precisely one way or the other, but if you only ever get to flip it once, then you'll never learn much about how it was weighted.

The reason qubits are better than coins (and quantum algorithms are likely more powerful than probabilistic classical ones) is because of the constructive and destructive interference between qubits (as well as entanglement).

5820,"Yeah, I agree it is not the same. Class inheritance is a great feature in Python. You can do something quite similar with structures in Julia. Basically, you define a type (like ""Int"", ""Float"", etc, which are predefined types). You assign methods to this type, just like in Python. Then you can define new types that belong to the original one, which can have its own methods, but can also use the methods from the ""parent"" type.

The big difference is that methods do not live inside the types (like in Python). Multiple dispatch is possible thanks to this  property.

5828," I have been testing Julia the last 2 months and I am completely in love with it. I work with fermionic quantum information and was able to run my program 10 times faster than Mathematica and 100 times faster than Python. Besides, I think it is a really clean language, even more readable than Python.

Julia has many well developed packages, but being a young language as it is, it is still very far away from Python in this matter. However: every Python's package can be called directly in Julia (and not through an API), and data and functions obtained from it can be processed with Julia code. So it is not true that there is nothing developed, you can grab a ton of Python content, including quantum computation packages!

The drawbacks:

1) It is a young language, and there is not so much bibliography as with other languages. The community, however, is really active and supportive, so it was not a major problem for me. 

2) I still believe Mathematica (paid language!) is much stronger for symbolic calculations. Although this is also true for Python (Sympy has no match to the simplicity of Mathematica).

I must remind you, as a physicist that likes things organized, that the Ju in Jupyter stands for Julia. So jupyter notebooks are completely Julia friendly. There is no need to work directly in an IDE.

TLDR: it is an open source language with the speed of C and the readability of Python, with direct access to every Python package and optimized for scientific computation. I think it has an enormous potential as a language in our community.",1591460257,QuantumComputing,sydbarrett210,Quantum,Comment,273

As I was first learning about quantum computing and climbing up the ""Dunning-Kruger wall"" I was at a meetup event and thought to ask the question:  Is there the possibility of a one-time use biological substrate for quantum computing? I was expecting to be completely disregarded and laughed at for asking the question since I obviously didn't know enough about any of the subjects. However, I was surprised that the panelists didn't dismiss it completely and one talked about some research that was tangentially related. I think this is the quantum biocomputing that you are talking about. When I was asking the question I was envisioning some type of ""sheet"", which may have an algorithm encoded in it and upon some inputs that would serve as a catalyst the sheet would begin to compute as a part of a biological process and produce results that would survive the computation. The sheet would no longer be usable after though.

5866,"That's awesome! I think you should look into QML but start with classical and focus there. As we get more quantum sensors and communications in place we'll be generating more quantum data.  There will be places for optimization of networks in supply chains or logistics optimization with some quantum positioning systems in place.  We'll need to process it all somehow and QML comes in there. For BI tools/analysis of financials or sentiment or demographics your best friend will be classical AI for a long time. If at some point the value of having all data be quantum outweighs the cost to run/embed/store that data (assuming we solve the QRAM problem - quantum information cannot be stored currently) then maybe this will be the case but that could be decades upon decades away **if** it ever happens. Thing is classical computers have a big head start and are pretty damn good at a lot of problems. I think of it like a hammer and screwdriver (very crude) but basically they are different tools for solving different problems (can hammer a screw in but cannot screw in a nail. Not to mention btw the classical computers are like power tools now so a super cheap jackhammer vs. a very very expensive powerless screwdriver at the moment).

On a side note: I love QML but its just important to understand the limitations - because, if people have high expectations and get disappointed, you could get a winter like we had in AI a few times hence my stronger feelings.  Personally QML for optimizing quantum circuits (specific to simulating quantum chemistry) like meta qml for chemical simulation might be what shows advantage first though so it certainly has a place in the near term!",1591232169,QuantumComputing,trawling,Quantum,Comment,290

5868,"No. It's not ready. We are close, but no one has solved production relevant problems and its not about just another qubit. You must also consider fidelities, cross talk and coherence times. People have done POCs, with chemical simulation, QML, and optimization, but fundamentally his target industries are way off. You will see real world advantage in simulating chemical systems before you see QML or optimization play a role. QML is only useful for things where the data is quantum. As in finance and BI the data is inherently not quantum (like some wave function generated in nature). Stock price, and views on your social page are not quantum in nature.   


It is more likely that we first see a new material simulated that is novel and has valuable properties generated more accurately, more quickly or more efficiently.  


This is a year or two away but with 100 some qubits with 99.9% 2q gate fidelities and cross talk close to 0 you could potentially simulate a new molecule of industrial interest. With these same stats you would not be able to optimize enough variables to solve anything financially (like portfolio optimization, QGANs for nash equilibrium or quantum monte carlo to be relevant.

5930,"Honestly I'm not much of an expert on Quantum Computing languages, but saying qiskit runs on a real quantum processor is kind of misleading. 

That is only because IBM has already set up quantum computers to be available to the end user (in a very simple and functional manner at that). Microsoft has been working on setting up quantum computers which can be accessed through Azure. In fact, they [already have an invite-only access](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/) to their service. To run it on a real quantum processor will only be a matter of time. Also they speak of partnering with IonQ et al, which are working on trapped ion circuits, which arguably show a lot of potential over the super-conducting qubits that IBM provides.

And both qiskit and Q# have fully functional quantum simulators.

I haven't studied qiskit as such (I was working on other things at the time ibm-quantum-challenge happened (big regret here)) so I can't really speak for how good the qiskit-textbook is, but Quantum Katas (Microsoft's quantum tutorials) are very rigorous and fun to solve, and I definitely learned much more than I knew before. Although from a glance it seems qiskit has much more mature and developed quantum stack as compared Q#.

That said, Q# is a rather weird language, especially if you're coming from the python lands. And you need dotnet to make it work, which can be problematic on linux distributions. It's challenging, which is part of what makes it fun to use.

So I'd definitely say a beginner should start with qiskit over Q#, not merely owing to the simplicity but that IBM has made the right choice in having a very active community engagement on slack, as compared to an obscure channel on gitter (_slyfully looks at Q#_).

5934,"&gt; one-way function

My understanding of the paper is that there is no need for the function to be one-way. Non-cryptographic universal hash functions like (ax+b) mod p mod m will do fine. Actually, I'm fairly confident their theorem still works with non-universal hash functions with bounded collision probability.

I gather that you mean that k is any k in the range [0..2^n ]. In Shor's algorithms, g^k mod N is computed from a_i = g^(2^i) mod N, as part of classical preprocessing. So the modular exponential is computed from matrices that take x \in [1..N-1] to a_i x mod N. But in QM can't you just sum out the floor(x/m) part in the transition matrix and have m x m matrices that take x_r \in [1..N-1] st x mod m = r to a_i x_r mod N mod m = s and from the Markov property of transition matrices, the transition amplitudes will be correct (with normalization) for g^k mod N mod m? To be sure, the transition matrices for almost all a_i will be nearly uniform (to within poly(log N)m/N), but there will be non-uniform terms that are proportional to a_i/(N mod a_i)*m/N, so there is a pattern from adding up fence post errors. (Also there are inherent small inaccuracies in computing transition amplitudes if N is not prime.)

Such m x m transition matrices don't constitute a family of homomorphic hash function, but they can be used to compute a universal hash function (like (ax +b ) mod N mod m) of the modular exponential. It would take a QFT-function-QFT circuit which only used polylog qubits for the period registers, for the Factoring in BPP result to hold.",1590868033,QuantumComputing,O10infinity,Quantum,Comment,281
5935,"&gt; u seem pretty certain that I'm wrong, but I assure you, I am even more certain that I am right. And I did make my case in some detail.

I could be a Turing award winner or illiterate, irrelevant either way to merit of scientific ideas. I have CS credentials among others but I have no desire to list them here. 

Regarding ""algorithm complexity"", as I said before, ""no"" - but nevertheless I have much more sympathy for your position than my language previously conveyed - I concede ""algorithm time complexity"" and similar are commonly used phrases. 

However clearly 'commonly used' does not imply correct or scientifically accurate. 
I claim when you consider ""algorithm complexity"", most reasonable paths lead to problem complexity as the better-defined notion. (Two important observations: i) any problem has an infinite number of algorithms solving it - e.g. take one alg and add an arbitrary number of _nop() in the middle - what if these ops are ""scrambled""? Which algorithm is meaningful?  ii) for most algorithms we *cannot* tightly bound the runtime if at all - think about the connection to the Halting problem - does this not make your complexity measure undecidable generally? what is the complexity of such algorithms? 
iii) the input format/domain/etc. are critically important - think sorting algorithms restricted to presorted lists - how does one then compare performance of 2 algorithms meaningfully?)

Two rhetorical quantum examples to chew on:
i) Consider Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: In this case we have a sufficient condition to bound the runtime for ""solving"" a problem (the spectral gap condition) - but we do not have necessary condition - so what is the ""time complexity"" of AQO? What if i specified polynomial runtime as part of the algorithm, then what is this solving?
ii) Suppose VQE with some fixed ansatz has runtime f(n), but outputs an answer that has no error guarantees (could be near-exact or could be garbage) - what is the ""time complexity"" of this algorithm? (I'd argue undefined; whereas runtime on its own clearly is meaningful)

I don't know who you are and your comment made me think you are a mid-term PhD student in quantum chemistry, possibly in the Aspuru-Guzik group, meaning you hadn't really been exposed to much computer science yet. I had previously been operating under the assumption that you're at a similar level to me – a few years out of graduate school now and with some experience in costing quantum algorithms. That's all I meant. I agree I didn't phrase it well.

I'm still not quite sure where to place you. I'm sticking with my guess that your background is in quantum chemistry rather than computer science, because I was correct to say that complexity is a property of algorithms and that the concept of problem complexity derives from the concept of algorithm complexity. But it's a subtle point, and it's hard won knowledge for someone like me who never formally studied computer science. You seem pretty certain that I'm wrong, but I assure you, I am even more certain that I am right. And I did make my case in some detail.

It's true that the electronic structure problem shouldn't be though of in terms of whether it's a QMA-complete problem or not. I did say that my concern was expressed clumsily. What I meant is that it is not a good idea to say that VQE is good at finding ground states. We have to be far more careful in saying what it is supposed to be doing. These are also reasonable complaints about phase estimation based algorithms, as you have correctly said.

As someone who has spent the better part of the last few years doing  painstaking complexity analysis for quantum algorithms (including for quantum chemistry), I have concerns about how much VQE is actually adding to the story. [Since the beginning](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5213), the technique looked like an excuse for not doing phase estimation in proof-of-principle experiments for purportedly useful quantum algorithms. I see such experiments as following in the tradition of [Vandersypen et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/414883a), which is interesting experimentally but [cuts too many corners](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12290) to satisfy a theorist like me.

And there is plenty of precedent for the kinds of concerns I have about VQE. I cut my teeth as a referee on quantum discord papers, which is a subject that seems thankfully to have pretty much died off. I watched the [weak value amplification](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.040406) kerfuffle quite closely. There is a habit of dubious ideas getting more play than they deserve because they justify superficially compelling experiments. And VQE simply seems like one of these ideas to me.

What really concerns me is that VQE getting inflated even more than the other ideas because of the massive public interest in quantum computing. I cannot stress enough how dangerous this might be if VQE is really as problematic as it appears to me. As scientists we have to display our skepticism as loudly as our optimism, or we risk being seen as charlatans. Worse, we risk being *rightfully* seen as charlatans.",1590840303,QuantumComputing,YuvalRishu,Quantum,Comment,511

5967,"The paper points out an interesting lack-of-restriction in the oracle function used by Shor's algorithm. Basically, if you found a one-way function `hash` such that `hash(g^k mod N)` could be computed without using many work qubits (i.e. without computing `g^k mod N` as an intermediate value) then Shor's algorithm could be run using less space.

Personally, I think it's really unlikely that such a hash function exists. Even simple functions like `(g^k mod N) mod 2` seem to require computing the intermediate value `g^k mod N`. The modular exponential is known for ""being kinda random"" or ""not having useful structure"", which is why it works as a cryptographic primitive, but an exploitable pattern is exactly what you'd need in order to avoid computing the modular exponential as an intermediate value.

(There are some computer science caveats around using ridiculous amounts of time to compute any function using very little space. Those should go away if you require that the energy cost of the computation be polynomial in the size of the number to factor.)

Hard no. We have been talking about computational complexity which as I said is a property of problems not algorithms. (Constructive algorithms give complexity upper bounds).

You are confused with basic CS terminology; algorithm runtime analysis is not ""complexity""",1590726986,QuantumComputing,powerofshower,Quantum,Comment,50
5980,"I see you know less about the subject than I thought. I'll back up.

Algorithms are the *only* things that have complexities. To talk about the complexity of a *problem* is technically an abuse of language. When we refer to the complexity of a problem, we are referring to the complexity of the most efficient possible algorithm for solving that problem.

So, for example, there are many sorting algorithms with many different complexities. The complexities are often further subdivided into worst-case and average-case complexities. Many naïve sorting algorithms have O\( *n*^2 \) worst-case runtimes (where *n* refers to the number of elements in the array to be sorted), cleverer algorithms used in practice have O\( *n* polylog *n* \) runtime, and the best possible algorithm for sorting a randomly ordered list has O \( *n* log *n* \) runtime. So we have multiple algorithms with multiple complexities *for the same computational problem*. When we say that sorting has a worst-case runtime of O \( *n* log *n* \), we are saying that the best possible algorithm for sorting a randomly ordered array has a worst-case runtime of O \( *n* log *n* \).

I am asking about the complexity of VQE as an algorithm, not about the complexity class of the problem or problems that VQE is designed to solve. This is why your earlier comment about promise problems was an irrelevant nitpick and not the foundational issue you seemed to think it was. I have left aside the question of whether VQE solves a difficult problem and am focussed entirely on the question of the complexity of VQE *algorithms*.

To establish the complexity of an algorithm, we need first to establish the primitive operations. Like a recipe, an algorithm presumes that the executor understands how to perform simple and well-specified tasks. The algorithm then prescribes a sequence of these tasks to be executed in order. One of my chief concerns about VQE is that the primitive operations are unclear. And this is not true of the phase estimation based quantum chemistry algorithms that historically precede VQE.

Returning to your questions, things like dependence on a matrix property reflect the assumed input representation used by a given algorithm (e.g. we can use fast subroutines for sparse matrix multiplication when we know that is the case) - for a particular quantum ansatz these will often affect the cost of preparing the ansatz state (for example, if a Hamiltonian simulation subroutine is used with cost depending on sparsity)

Spectral gap typically comes into play for same reasons as power method - similar but different ideas in analysis of adiabatic QC - unclear in either case how these ideas relate to VQE and its convergence (highly dependent on particular ansatz...)

Operator norm typically comes into play in cost of preparing the ansatz state (think Hamiltonian simulation). For a particular ansatz this could be elaborated on...",1590509342,QuantumComputing,powerofshower,Quantum,Comment,253

6061,"&gt;It sounded from the lecture that quantum computing has reached the point where some of the problems are well defined. Now might be the time to write a high level language, or at least to make a start at one.

Have to be careful treating quantum computing as though it will become some kind of obvious successor to current digital computers. Even though QCs could offer substantially exponential improvements over current digital for certain computations, you only get that performance improvement when you have an algorithm that takes advantage of quantum properties. A lot of the computational payloads that ordinary digital computers are good at now are expected to still be faster on plain old transistor logic in the future.

In fact, for the foreseeable future, quantum computers will still depend on a substantial amount of digital logic for control and interfacing. A quantum computer is not a quantum monolith, but more of a quantum/digital hybrid. Because of that, I don't see a high level language being that useful to a quantum computing scientist designing quantum algorithms. I think what is more likely; software engineers will continue to use a language like C or Python normally, and when you encounter computational payload that runs faster on a QC, you will simply pass that to a QC via an API.",1590458874,QuantumComputing,nnsmkngsctn,Quantum,Comment,219

I don't know either.  I'm not even sure quantum computers are at the point where you can just load an arbitrary state.  Usually, you just start with a relatively simple state (all zeros) and pass it through quantum gates to change the state.

My point is this: I have told you a representation that (a) is sufficient to describe quantum systems and (b) is useful enough that every one uses it.  If there is a q-computer that is able to load an arbitrary state, I bet it uses this representation.

Sure. Just about any academic example of a multi-qubit system will work to demonstrate this. I'm working through [this tutorial](https://jarrodmcclean.com/basic-quantum-circuit-simulation-in-python/) at the moment. If you look at the `NKron` routine, you will see where the simulator expands out the entire quantum state-space for a given set of N qubits. The author uses an example of a CNOT in a system of 5 qubits. Since 2^5 = 32, you will find that that the matrix `FiveQubitState` is a column-vector having 32 rows. Your challenge is this: Calculate the output of `CNOT03` (as visible in `NewState`)  using a column vector having only 5 rows, instead of 32. If you are clever, you will be able to find a way to do this for the cases where each of the qubits are in one of the basis states |0&gt; or |1&gt; -- it's just Boolean logic. But your solution should calculate the correct result for *any* rotation of the input qubits. You can't do that without a 32-row column vector.

The reason this is the case is that we can *measure* any one of these states at the output of the quantum computer (that is, its qubits). This is why entanglement reduces the amount of information required to model the qubits. If all three qubits are fully entangled, then the only two states that can be measured at the output of the quantum computer are {000, 111}.

In general, you cannot calculate the probability distribution over all possible measurements of the qubits using a ""qubit-by-qubit"" method.

6137,"&gt; To answer your question: yes, you need to know how to express the Hamiltonian as a sum of local Paulis. But to me that's something that you get from a microscopic model of your system, or an effective description

Sorry but i'm cringing a bit:

-Standard non-relativistic born-oppenheimer problem is for electrons in real space + Pauli exclusion (i.e. already approximate)

-Fock space (span of slater determinants generated from a complete set of single particle basis functions) is (roughly) isomorphic to the direct sum of all the different particle number antisymmetric sectors

-We cannot represent this space efficiently (require infinite basis funcitons) so we ad hoc pick (truncate to) a set of m orbitals (which generate multiparticle basis funcitons as Slater determinants)

-This Hamiltonian is represented in fock space by fermionic creation/annihilation operators with polynomial # of terms in m  (because interactions at most real-space quadratic / fock-space quartic)
-We map this to a QC (i.e., embed the fermionic algebra) using Jordan-Wigner or other schemes such as Bravyi-Kitaev

-This gives a representation of our approximate electronic Hamiltonian as a linear combination of tensor products of Pauli matrices

To your questions: I have partly addressed them in comments elsewhere in this post.  

""I feel I am being forced to read between lines to extract even this simple story"" - definitely, much of the literature is let's say ""poorly worded"" - in particular often a huge disconnect between the chemists and computer scientists.

You are correct ""the quantum processor being used to evaluate a computationally expensive utility function"", but be careful the apparent computational gain is not from the observable per se but rather from the state ansatze which appear exponentially expensive to prepare classically. 

Re ""then there is nothing heuristic about VQE outside of any heuristics that may have been used in the classical optimisation routine"" - NO. The electronic structure problem in VQE is solved approximately - e.g. the best parameters from the best ansatz which lives inside *some subspace* of Hilbert space - as we do NOT have general bounds relating the energy obtained their to the unrestricted energy it's indeed a heuristic - chemists often ""forget this"" in how they speak.
(i.e., we optimize within some span of a set of basis functions, which is independent from various approximation in the underlying problem such as Born-Oppenheimer...)

It is absolutely fine if you want to nitpick what you are calling my complexity argument. I did start this conversation by saying I do not understand VQE. Based on the other thread I have learned that we are to view VQE as a heuristic, like simulated annealing. And it’s true that simulated annealing is an insane way to solve optimisation problems that have a small set of candidate solutions. If the analogy is good enough, this would certainly meet OP’s concerns. But I dispute the analogy.

My understanding is that VQE is essentially classical optimisation (heuristic or otherwise) but with the quantum processor being used to evaluate a computationally expensive utility function. Please do tell me if I have this right — I feel I am being forced to read between lines to extract even this simple story. If I do have this right, then there is nothing heuristic about VQE outside of any heuristics that may have been used in the classical optimisation routine. The whole point of VQE is to exploit what I have to imagine is a definite speedup in utility function evaluation. If so, what speedup are we talking about?

6159,"No, this doesn't make Google's surface code plans obsolete.

When I originally saw the title of Ben's paper (A fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate for the surface code in two dimensions) I got excited. Transversal gates in the surface code typically have spacetime volume that scales like O(d^2), where d is the code distance. Magic state distillation has costs that scale like O(d^3). This could be a huge improvement over that! But this ""transversal"" gate also had costs that scaled like O(d^3), and it required multiple layers of qubits, and more complicated just-in-time decoding, and, and, and...

I had the opportunity to talk to Ben Brown at QEC about this non-Clifford gate. What he indicated is that the point of his paper was not to do better than magic state distillation, but to show that there was another possible strategy to explore. In its current state that strategy performs much, much worse than magic state distillation. But maybe with more work eventually someone will find a way to make it competitive.

The article also talks about a paper on correcting biased noise. The tricky thing with biased noise is definitely the physical implementation. You need to be able to apply interactions with an X-axis component (such as a CNOT) and a Y-axis component (such as a CY) without introducing the possibility of X-axis and Y-axis errors. But any sort of over-rotation in your control mechanism will introduce such errors (or leakage, which is worse). It's very cool that the threshold is so high, but that only matters if the assumptions can be turned into experimental reality. There are groups pursuing this... personally, I remain skeptical.

6170,"Got it, I see what you're trying to say. I think part of the confusion might be coming from the more general idea of quantum states, which is a little bit different from what's going on with a qubit. Complex numbers enter into the picture from quantum mechanics in general, *before* the concept of a qubit. I'm not really sure you can start with the qubit to understand why we need complex numbers.

I'll go through your example specifically, hopefully it's helpful:

&gt;To me, the X axis of this circle represents the probability amplitude  (i.e. the x value squared equals the probability) of the qubit being  measured as a 1. I conceive of the Y axis of this circle as the  probability amplitude of the qubit being measured as a 0.

This is fine if the amplitude were real, but the amplitudes are complex. I'll go into more detail below.

&gt;So in my mind, we could (ignoring phase) represent the probability of  the qubit being measured just with the curve of the unit circle between  (1,0) and (0,1), with a 45 degree angle representing 50/50 probability.

Be careful about switching between probability amplitude and probability. They are totally different things! Quantum effects really show up in the amplitude, not the probability. If you're talking about regular probability, this is fine. But then this is no different from representing a coin flip, either.

&gt;However, since the qubit can have phase (positive and negative phase)  for each probability, we have to include the rest of the curve of the  unit circle. I'm obviously missing something here because I didn't even  mention/utilize complex numbers and I'm also thinking of the qubit in  terms of a circle not a sphere I realized.

The amplitude is a complex number. If you recall the polar form of complex numbers, you can think of this as a vector in 2D. The length of the arrow represents the probability, and the angle of the arrow is the phase. The phase isn't just positive or negative, it can be anything. Remember, we're not just *squaring* the amplitude, we're taking the *modulus squared*. For real numbers, there's no difference. But for complex numbers, it's an entirely different story. **Any** complex number of the form cos(θ) + i sin(θ) will give you a modulus squared (and thus a probability) of 1.

Going back to that first sentence with X being the amplitude of the 1 state and Y being the amplitude of the 0 state — in order to represent a complex amplitude, we actually need 2 dimensions rather than 1 for each state. The full state of the system actually lives in 4 dimensions. Fortunately, the qubit restricts us to systems in which the probabilities must add to 1, and the global phase also doesn't matter, so this allows us to cut things down from 4D space into a unit sphere in 3D.",1590196763,QuantumComputing,exoteuthology,Quantum,Comment,483

6184,"&gt;I’m not sure I articulated any particular philosophy of doing science beyond announcing skepticism when I have it.

Sure. I'm just guessing :)

&gt;I appreciate you naming some problems but it isn’t enough. You alluded to the idea that we have a state that is promised to be near the ground state. 

I never gave such a promise. In fact such a promise doesn't exist. Results so far have been  problem-specific and generalizations should be made with caution. 

&gt;I also need some assurance that we’re talking about problems that aren’t QMA-complete.

Even if the problem were QMA-complete, I would still argue that VQE isn't necessarily useless. Because there's many a slip between QMA-completeness and good performance in practice. Computational hardness tells you nothing about *which instances of the problem are hard*. That's why heuristics exist, to try to make the best of the situation. In fact, any gap between demonstrated performance and performance bounds are a gateway into new research on complexity and algorithms research. It's the same with VQE. If someone comes along and dequantizes VQE itself, giving a classical algorithm that gives comparable (or better) energy convergence as VQE, that's when I will say let's throw out VQE for good and maybe focus on fault-tolerant schemes for state preparation.

&gt;In any event, I got nothing for ideas. This isn’t my forte. But I haven’t heard how VQE is going to solve these problems either.

I guess now I'm confused. How are you proposing to solve a 100+ qubit problem with a sign problem on a classical computer? I can think of three-ish approaches, and they all fail (to the best of my knowledge):

1. Sampling-based approaches such as monte carlo: You can make the sign problem pretty severe and make sampling pretty much impossible unless you find some special encoding of the problem.
2. Tensor networks: Hard to contract classically when you're in 2 dimensions or higher. 
3. Machine learning: Big question mark as to what is possible here, more so than something like VQE.

With existing quantum processors, system sizes are still just shy of 100 qubits and gate fidelities typically won't allow more than say depth \~10 circuits. In this regime, VQE is already possibly useful but doesn't beat classical prowess. However, it is believed that we're heading to that regime in the coming decade, no? Once we're at say 300 qubits and 30 gates, 

&gt;I  would really like to understand what it is that I’m missing. I have the  same concerns as OP but I don’t think I can be accused of ignorance at  this point. I guess I’m looking for a computational problem  specification and some kind of complexity analysis for both VQE and  reasonable classical approaches.

I can't help you there because as far as I'm aware, such an analysis doesn't exist (at least on a large enough scale). I would also like to see something like this. There are some nebulous notions that sampling problems with a sign problem (specifically ""non-stoquasticity"") might be hard, but also the sign problem is basis-dependent and can be fixed if you find the right basis, but ALSO it is NP-hard to generally do a local basis change to fix the sign problem.

Suppose the qubit is encoded into the electronic state of an atom, and that this electronic state is controlled by lasers.

The valence electron in the atom will be partially driven between electronic states, and can end up either in an eigenstate of that atom (excited = |1&gt;,  not excited = |0&gt;) or, it can be in a superposition of excited and not excited. If we measure the state of the atom when it's in an eigenstate, we get the same value every time. If we measure the state of the atom when it's in a superposition, then the probability of measuring an excited state is equal to the square modulus of the probability amplitude. 

It is hard to conceptualize what it means for an atom to be in the superposition of |excited&gt;+|not excited&gt; in comparison to the superposition |excited&gt; -i|not excited&gt;.

Oh, I see. 

&gt;So, once we make these ""models"" or simplifications are made, do we find ourself in a regime where classical won't do but quantum will?

Maybe never. It's possible that deep learning is actually capable of predicting energies for a given problem type, and it just boils down to using the right model and training sufficiently. I'm skeptical that this will be easy given how complex some random spin models can be but I'm happy to be wrong on that.

This is a great method, should yield an exponential speed up over doing full CI classically, but will likely require a huge fault tolerant quantum computer that will likely not be available anytime soon, at least for molecules larger than a few atoms.

On the other hand, [VQE allows you to write a wave function in terms of a few classical parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04279) (the Unitary Coupled Cluster approximation is often proposed), prepare a state corresponding to that initial state, and then measure the energy of that state. You could then use a classical computer to run an optimization loop, where the classical computer varies the wave function that the quantum computer samples. This will *still* require a big machine, but perhaps might be do-able on quantum hardware available in the near term.

Given that we don't really now how to efficiently classically evaluate the UCC for large molecules anyway, VQE *in theory* also leads to an exponential speedup.

To answer your question: yes, you need to know how to express the Hamiltonian as a sum of local Paulis. But to me that's something that you get from a microscopic model of your system, or an effective description. For example, people typically model atomic orbitals in second quantization and the Hamiltonian becomes a fermion hopping Hamiltonian, usually with some quartic interaction terms (think Fermi-Hubbard model). Now, is this exactly accurate? No. To be exactly accurate you'd need to literally simulate quantum electrodynamics. But it's good enough for chemistry. 

Usually it's reasonable to assume that you have some such local description a priori. If you didn't, then the system is just some black box whose physics you can't even set up, and I can't imagine how you'd simulate it.

That's a 10^300 dimensional matrix. 

When your system is sufficiently local (as most physical systems are), VQE is a great solution that does not require error correction. You only need the ability to simulate local interactions in either an analog or digital way. 

Also, H2 is the gold standard now because it's where we're at technologically. Of course the end goal isn't H2, thinking that is like saying in 1960 that the end goal of computers is adding large numbers together. The end goal is, for example, the band structure of more complex materials.

6236,"Wait, you've got me confused by saying there are an infinite number of phases for every probability. Let me explain how I'm thinking about this right now and tell me where I'm off:

So I imagine a circle (a unit circle actually). To me, the X axis of this circle represents the probability amplitude (i.e. the x value squared equals the probability) of the qubit being measured as a 1. I conceive of the Y axis of this circle as the probability amplitude of the qubit being measured as a 0.

So in my mind, we could (ignoring phase) represent the probability of the qubit being measured just with the curve of the unit circle between (1,0) and (0,1), with a 45 degree angle representing 50/50 probability.

However, since the qubit can have phase (positive and negative phase) for each probability, we have to include the rest of the curve of the unit circle. I'm obviously missing something here because I didn't even mention/utilize complex numbers and I'm also thinking of the qubit in terms of a circle not a sphere I realized.

One possible way I'm thinking that complex numbers fit in here is that phase might have two dimensions, not one. So instead of phase being just positive or negative along one dimension, maybe phase can be positive or negative along two dimensions, one represented as positive/negative real numbers, and one represented as positive/negative imaginary number. With the length of the vector in whatever of those 4 directions being the square root of the probability of the qubit being measured as a 0. So that would give us 4 possible phase states.

6249,"I think the ""wave mechanics"" approach is a good intuition to build from (and is how the Feyman lectures - and many other intro QM sources - present it: [https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III\_03.html](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_03.html)). There are other ways of looking at it, but this borrows from intuition around classical waves and circuit theory that many people are already familiar with from introductory physics.

To elaborate on your questions directly:

&gt;(a) what value does having these 'phases' provide and (b) what observations necessitated this mathematical representation?

Ignoring the interpretation of the phase for now, the intuition here is the same as for classical waves. Waves that are 180 degrees out-of-phase will destructively interfere and cancel out. Analogously, the global phase of an infinite sine wave is meaningless, but the relative phase between two of them will determine their superposed behavior. The double-slit experiment or the Mach-Zender interferometer give experimental evidence for this.

&gt;(c). For the probability that a qubit is measured as 0, the complex  number is represented as being along the 2 dimensional unit circle with  +/- 1, and +/- i. For 100% (+1 v. -1) and 0% (+i and -i) this makes  sense as having two phases to represent each probability. But for all  the other probabilities in between, there are 4 representations

Be careful, I think you might be getting confused by the Bloch sphere (which represents a two-level system). In your single-state picture, the probability is represented by the *length* of your amplitude vector. There are actually an **infinite** number of phases for every probability: your probability amplitude is Ae\^iθ. The probability being 100%, or anything else, only determines A, and θ can take any value (this is the global phase that /u/orangedelorean has mentioned). From your example, an amplitude of +/-1 and +/- i would both represent 100% probability.",1590124045,QuantumComputing,exoteuthology,Quantum,Comment,299

6252,"Multiplying a quantum state by a global phase is like looking at it from a different angle - it doesn't fundamentally change anything.

In other words, multiplying everything by -1 or i adds no new information and is equivalent to doing nothing.

Some of the states you've written are actually quantum-mechanically identical, meaning that no experiment could distinguish between them:

(-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)i/2) is quantum-mechanically identical to  (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2) and   
(-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2) is quantum-mechanically identical to  (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)i/2)

(sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2) is different from (-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2) and they can be distinguished experimentally.

If you measured the two states directly, then as you stated you would have a 50% probability of measuring 0 or 1 in both cases. But what if you rotate the states 90 degrees clockwise around the circle?

(sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2) goes to 1, and (-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)i/2) goes to 0

6254,"See u/CptMartelo 's reply for some clarifications regarding misunderstandings you have about probability and its relationship to quantum measurements. See [this excellent web lecture](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html) by Scott Aaronson for some illuminating discussion of the counter-intuitive consequences of complex probability amplitudes. The correspondence you are looking for to tie complex probability amplitudes back to classical probability theory is this: a complex probability amplitude corresponds to the classical probability *distribution* (except the latter can only ever be a non-negative value at each point of the sample space). The restriction, however, is that *measuring* a given sample is equivalent to taking the modulus (squared) of the complex probability amplitude, ensuring that we will always get a real, non-negative probability. What this means is that the probabilities that we measure on the output (observable) of a quantum system always obey standard (real) probability laws, but the underlying ""probabilities"" (as sampled according to the complex probability amplitude) can do ""weird"" things like cancelling out due to destructive interference. To quote Aaronson:

&gt; The reason you never see this sort of interference in the classical world is that probabilities can't be negative. So, cancellation between positive and negative amplitudes can be seen as the source of all ""quantum weirdness"" -- the one thing that makes quantum mechanics different from classical probability theory.

6275,"I am also a quantum chemistry PhD student who is now working on some quantum computing algorithms, so I hope I can give some good advice.

Honestly I think the best starting project would be to implement your own quantum simulator in a language of your choice, like python. A possible set of steps that will get you pretty far is

1) Code up a quantum register (2\^N length complex vector)

2) Implement single qubit gates for any qubit position. For example: On a 4 qubit register a hadamard gate on qubit 2 would be built like \[;I \\otimes H \\otimes I \\otimes I;\] as a 16x16 matrix to act on the register where I is the identity matrix.

3) Add CNOT gates to your code. (Can't be built with only tensor products!)

4) Next, implement a quantum chemists favorite Hamiltonian (H2 with a sto-3g basis) directly with a Jordan-Wigner mapping. (Make sure you are comfortable with second quantization notation)

5) For a stretch challenge, implement a quantum phase estimation algorithm using your code for H2 sto-3g to estimate the Full CI ground state energy of said molecule.

If you do all 5, or at least 1-4 of, these I am sure you will have a much better grasp of the topic, and can probably understand a decent amount of the quantum chemistry / quantum computing papers out there. Best of luck.",1590035235,QuantumComputing,tstu,Quantum,Comment,232

Certain types of problems can take billions of years to solve on our current conventional computers. Quantum computers, however, can solve these types of problems in just seconds. Because of their ‘quantum power’, quantum computers have the potential to impact many fields, such as machine learning, medicine, and energy systems.

• So how do quantum computers actually work?

• How do we build quantum computers?

• What are the other potential applications of quantum computing?

• How much progress have we made?

Both the Hadamard gate and a Ry(pi/2) bring the state |0&gt; to (|0&gt; + |1&gt;)/sqrt(2), but they are not the same operator.  

So you'd need to pick the axis of rotation. There are infinite such axis. All on a circle that bisects the two states. 

There are two obvious choices for an axis; Either the axis that is perpendicular to both states.  
Or the axis in between the two states (so that we require a pi rotation around it). Bonus is that that same operator will also rotate the second state back to the first.   

Let's pick the latter.

The axis you want to rotate around is (A + A')|0&gt; + (B + B')|1&gt; = C|0&gt; + D|0&gt;. (Don't forget to normalize)

Or as density matrix: [[CC\*, CD\*], [C\*D, BD\*]].   (With ^(*) being the conjugate).

Or as vector n = (CD^(*) + C^(*)D, i(CD^\* - C^(*)D), CC^(*) - DD^(*))

(See [the Bloch Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere))

A rotation around an axis n is given by 

R_n(theta) = cos(theta/2)\*I - i sin(theta/2)\*(n\_xX, n_yY, n_zZ).  

Plugging in numbers (theta = pi) gives you the final operator, just need to calculate C and D from A, A', B and B', including normalization:  

(CD^(*) + C^(*)D)X  + i(CD^(*) - C^(*)D)Y + (CC^(*) - DD^(*))Z.

----

A sanity check:  
This should be the Hadamard if A = 1, B = 0, A' = 1/sqrt(2), B' = 1/sqrt(2).  (From |0&gt; to (|0&gt; + |1&gt;)/sqrt(2))  

We have C = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2, D = 1/sqrt(2(2 + sqrt(2)). (Normalization is a bitch)  

2CD = 1/sqrt(2), CD - CD = 0, CC - DD = 1/sqrt(2)  

And thus gives you the final operator:  
(X/sqrt(2)  + 0Y + Z/sqrt(2)) = (X + Z)/sqrt(2) = H

You can learn to code, learn algorithms, learn efficiency and other cs things on the side but you can also learn physics on your own time while studying computer science. I took calf based physics 1+2 while in school but have spent a large majority of my time reading and watching videos on physics, chemistry and engineering and have become quite proficient in somewhat complicated fields of physics. 

Overall I think they all go hand in hand in a way. Physics, engineering, computer science usually cross paths in one way or another depending on what you do and what you’re interested in. If you’re interested in QC I think taking an assembly course could be a huge advantage. Understanding how a machine works and the code that does every step greatly helps to understand more complicated topics imo.

When you do encounter these numbers, realize that they represent something not on the graph you are working with. So if you think about like a graph on a sheet of paper, you could think of any number denoted in i as ""coming out of"" or ""going into"" the page. Much in the same way that the X axis is orthogonal to the Y axis, you could say that i-values are orthogonal to the X-Y plane.

6370,"Yes, something like that. Even though we're trying to work with words, maybe a simple example is in order. We'll write down the state of a single qubit as a(0)+b(1). Here, a and b are the encoded information. If, for instance, we'd have a ""bit flip"" error, the state of the qubit would change to b(0)+a(1), meaning our information got mixed up.  We would have no way of knowing if b(0)+a(1) is really what we were supposed to have, or if something went wrong.
  
Now we'll construct a simple error correcting code for this single qubit, using 3 physical qubits. The information will be encoded in the following manner: a(000)+b(111). Now, if one of the 3 qubits had a ""bit flip"" error, we'd get something like: a(010)+b(101). Notice that as opposed to the single qubit example, we can tell something went wrong here, and we can also tell exactly what went wrong: the middle qubit flipped. We can even detect the flip without knowing what a and b are by measuring correlations between the different qubits (meaning answering the question: are qubits 1 and 2 the same? are qubits 2 and 3 the same?). The correlations tell us nothing about a and b but everything about bit the bit flip.",1589719592,QuantumComputing,TheSumOfAllPeanuts,Quantum,Comment,210

6372,"Yes. You can roughly think about the wave function as having different parts: the encoded information, which is and must be unknown, and the error correcting part, which is known and decided upon beforehand. You now measure only the part that is known. If you got what you expected, that's great and it means that there's no error. If you got something else, that means that you know that an error is occurred, and you also know how to correct the error. You apply the correction and then get back the expected wavefunction, as it would have been if the error had not occurred at all.",1589717811,QuantumComputing,TheSumOfAllPeanuts,Quantum,Comment,106
6373,"After you collapse part of the wave function, can you reestablish it?",1589716813,QuantumComputing,mbergman42,Quantum,Comment,12
6374,"A quantum computer does not “use entanglement” to “read information” of anything. You can think of a quantum circuit as a description of the time evolution of a quantum system. So if you have a composite two level quantum system that is in some definite state (this can be generalized to mixed states but for simplicity we’ll consider pure (definite) states) and over time it evolves to some other state, that process of evolution can be represented as a quantum system where quantum logic gates evoke the changes on the system that would change it from the initial state to the final.

Now the states of your composite system depend on your choice of measurement. If your measurement basis is {n,k} a single qubit, then you should know that you can measure either n or k or some superposed state of n and k. If you have m qubits in your composite system, you will have a measurement basis of 2^m possible combination of n and k and you your composite system can be in one of those states or some superposition of those states.

Now some of these states are product states. That is, if we were to know the state somehow, we could determine the state of each individual qubit that led to the state we know. We say that your composite system is entangled whenever we CANNOT do this. 

Certain quantum gates can be arranged on composite system that converts a product state into an entangled state and when you measure the system using your measurement basis, you’ll get read that entangled state with some determined probability. But the entanglement process itself has nothing to do with the measurement process. Entanglement is usually the result of some physical process on your quantum system.",1589699934,QuantumComputing,seanthinks,Quantum,Comment,296
6375,"You're pretty close. If you learn what information is encoded on some qubit, you've collapsed it. There's no way of finding the state of the qubit without collapsing it.   
  
In quantum error correction, entanglement is used in a way that's similar to what you've alluded to. Several particles are entangled in order to represent a single qubit. Then, if we measure intelligently, we can collapse only part of the wave function. If we've done it right, the result of the measurement tells us what sort of error happened, but it tells us absolutely nothing of the encoded information. This way we can correct errors while maintaining the qubit wavefunction.",1589698837,QuantumComputing,TheSumOfAllPeanuts,Quantum,Comment,109

I'd guess that the people who designed Google's supremacy experiment were not looking at optimizations that could be had by tensor network contractions. Knowing that a supremacy experiment might have certain qualities that allow for exploitation by reduction, how could they be better designed?

6389,"No, in physical terms noise is deterministic in principle.  Like air particles, or grains of sand on a dune.  In principle with sufficient information you could calculate exactly where each is going, Newtonian physics apply.  In practical terms it is random, and there is no application you're going to do on a phone that would be able to detect the difference that I can think of...  

The article cited passwords, but that is unnecessary.  No one attacks a password by trying to determine the randomness it was assigned with, you just iterate.  Since there is no way of knowing how said password is generated, why would you even try?  On the other hand, a poorly generated password with true randomness (say, selecting one fixed-length word from a dictionary with a truly random process) is no better and generally a lot worse than a completely non-random process with better procedures (arbitrary number of varying length words selected by whim).  In that case, in principle randomness is just bragging rights, and still relies on good selection heuristics.

I know for high-energy physics applications and the like sometimes true randomness is necessary, but I cannot think of any process for a phone that would need it, I agree.

As a way forward... Optical quantum computing isn't necessarily the preferred route, but it is a viable one, and I would think that this is a step in that direction.  Since at least 2008 there's been a clear path forward for [optical systems](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.030503), and [recent advances](https://scitechdaily.com/army-researchers-advance-toward-quantum-computing-at-room-temperature/) seem to me to support the idea that practical applications for photonic circuit/optical crystals represent a good route for small scale quantum computing.  The low-temp methods work now, but I can't really see making them practical for use outside special facilities...  No personal use-case I can see.  Optical I can see (pun almost intended).

I would argue something like this will advance the practical integration of photonic and classical circuits, which will advance the path towards optical quantum computing.

Still not convinced that this quantum announcement is anything more than Marketing adding a buzzword to a pretty normal feature. 

Last point—this device has thousands of features enabled by billions of implementation details. This one detail caused the company to promote it as a quantum device.

I think there is a Bell curve that the noise falls into and it is likely to be anywhere in there, which keeps it in the realm of random if nothing unusual is happening and you need tests to make sure there isn't anything weird going on.  

That's been good enough for practical purposes, and I don't think I *need* true quantum randomness for anything.  But it isn't random in principle any more than mouse movements or anything else...  And if you really want true randomness only a decay-type event or an interference pattern or something will do it... Something that is a quantum event and not macro.  They're using light which generates an interference pattern, and until observed and collapse us truly random.

Your problem comes from observing computational complexity theory from afar, instead of actually working on it. The problem is not with quantum computers in theory.

Yes, that is the prevailing view. I am not directly disagreeing since I actually do understand the theory behind why a QC is faster than an ordinary digital computer (as far as we can tell). But this tells us nothing about other approaches to classical computation. Specifically, the ""quantum supremacy"" narrative explicitly overlooks stochastic computation which is not quantum but is also not automatically upper bounded by classical computational complexity limits. For large enough error margin, any computation becomes trivial on a stochastic machine. So you can't compare quantum with non-quantum computers without talking about noise margins. And real QCs are worst-case susceptible to noise. So that's where theory and practice meet.

The gate that does this will actually be the tensor product of the Z gate and two identity gates. Let’s call this tensor product G. We can represent G as an 8x8 matrix whose entries are

Row 1: 1  0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Row 2: 0 1  0 0 0 0 0 0

6481,"&gt; Are we including algorithms based on the Quantum Fourier transform (e.g. Shor's algorithm)? I thought those offered an exponential speedup.

QFT is exponentially faster than FFT on an exact digital computer. But there are other ways to perform a Fourier transform that are faster (if less exact). Note that QC also always involves some element of noise/uncertainty.

&gt; The speedup of a non-deterministic Turing machine over a QC would be far greater than the speedup of a QC over a deterministic Turing machine
&gt; 
&gt; Are the hybrid systems you speak of actually capable of exponential speedup? How do they work (on a high level)?

Note that hybrid computing and non-deterministic Turing machines are distinct. Hybrid computing systems are really existing systems that combine some element of analog or noise (in the case of stochastic computing) with digital computing elements. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a purely theoretical construct (unless P=NP).

The theory of computational complexity is notoriously subtle. My interest in the field is purely amateur and I have often found myself going back to basics and discovering that I had misunderstood some basic pillar of the discipline. In the case of comparing quantum and classical algorithms, it is important to realize that classical algorithms are always susceptible to improvement, not just by some constant, but by an entire complexity class (for example, moving an O( n^3 ) algorithm down to O( n^2.5 )). Cf [Blum's speedup theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum%27s_speedup_theorem). This is a consequence of the fact that a complexity class is defined by the problem to be solved (the language), not the algorithm that solves it (the machine).

In practical terms, what this means is that something we had assumed was difficult (simulating qubits on classical machines, for example) could turn out not to be as hard as we thought. We just needed a more clever approach. To see what I mean, realize that quantum theorists routinely solve quantum circuits on the blackboard. With carefully chosen inputs, even large quantum systems are solvable. So, that means that a classical simulator that is smart enough to recognize when a symbolic solution to a quantum circuit is possible could simulate all such circuits quickly, just like mathematicians do on the blackboard. I'm hand-waving, of course, but the point is that nobody knows that there isn't a classical algorithm that would do this for *all* inputs to a quantum circuit. Maybe you have to use some weird maths like topology or knot theory or something. Who knows. All we know for sure is that we don't know. Many, very smart people believe that QC will offer an enormous speedup over classical computing. We will see whether they are right. I hope they're right and I'm wrong. But I'm pretty sure I'm right.",1589239143,QuantumComputing,claytonkb,Quantum,Comment,460
6482,"&gt; The Hadamard may guarantee 50/50, but the entire process does not. The act of measurement does not simply give us the 0 or 1 returned by the Hadamard. Instead it undoes an additional random process by which a 1 is transformed to a 0 with some small probability (10%, say) and a 0 is transformed to 1 by an even smaller probability (let's just use 0%). This leads to a final probability distribution for which 0 occurs with probability 0.55, and 1 with 0.45.

Do you have any academic citations on this? And why does IBM's quantum simulator not exhibit the same statistical bias when replicating the exact same experiments on ibmq_qasm_simulator?

6485,"&gt; Isn't this a bit misleading?

No. CS is a theoretical discipline. How much oil you have to burn to power a computer or how many wall-clock hours pass is irrelevant to theoretical questions. We simply posit however many clock-cycles we need. That's one of those things that makes math different from physics. Quantum CS is a theoretical discipline. It targets a different hardware architecture but it's the same basic idea (inputs, outputs, circuits, computational complexity classes, etc. etc.)

&gt; Even though classical computers can simulate quantum systems, it seems likely that classical computers will not be able to simulate large quantum systems in any reasonable amount of time.

It's still an open question. Naive classical methods of simulating quantum computers are pretty bad. But it is worth noting that the best-known quantum speedups on interesting problems (search, etc.) are still only polynomial. That's wonderful if we can actually build one but, theoretically, it's not that impressive. The speedup of a non-deterministic Turing machine over a QC would be far greater than the speedup of a QC over a deterministic Turing machine (assuming P=/=NP, of course).

In my own personal opinion (full disclaimer) most estimates of quantum computing speedup are overblown because they are comparing against the wrong classical model (ordinary computers, that is, *exact* digital computers). A better model to compare against would be approximate digital or analog computers. These hybrid systems are typically seen in DSP applications, today.

Definition: H is ""stoquastic"" or ""has no sign problem"" iff, in the computational basis,  all off-diagonal terms are real and non-negative.

The spectral gaps for random and for some simple Hamiltonians become super-exponentially small so that the time required for adiabatic evolution to remain in the ground state is longer than the time required for even a classical computation. Nevertheless, it remains of some interest to ask about the computational power of AQC.

In AQC we consider H(t)=s(t) H_1+ (1−s(t))H_0 for some smooth s(t). If we require that the gap become only polynomially small so that the adiabatic evolution can be performed in polynomial time, then this model is equivalent to standard quantum computation, provided we are free to choose *any* H_0 and H_1.

Stoquastic Hamiltonians are known to be universal if we allow using excited states (non-adiabatic evolution), and adiabatic evolution is universal using general Hamiltonians (i.e. allowing those with a sign problem). However, if we restrict to the case that H is stoquastic and we remain in the ground state, then the problem of how powerful AQC is remains open.

Until now.

Hastings has shown a superpolynomial oracle separation between the power of adiabatic quantum computation with no sign problem and the power of classical computation.

At the same time, the result give no reason to believe that stoquastic AQC is capable of universal quantum computation - may be somewhere in the middle between the two.

This leads to a final probability distribution for which 0 occurs with probability 0.55, and 1 with 0.45.

A more direct answer: Right now, with the number and goodness of qubits that are currently being created, we can only do simulations of systems - as u/shaim2 mentions, things like chemistry and solid state physics. This probably won't have a lot of direct relevance to anyone who is interested in classical computation. 

The next stage, where we have thousands of physical qubits, will be more interesting. Scientists currently know how to put several different physical qubits together to make a ""logical"" qubit. The logical qubit will have some kind of error correction running on it, making it behave more like how you would think of a classical computer bit. With thousands of physical qubits, you could probably have dozens of logical qubits, making some very good tests of simple algorithms. 

At the scale of tens or hundreds of thousands of qubits, you will finally be breaking in to the level where you would see full realization of logical quantum computing. There is exponential gain for each additional qubit, so perhaps the ramp up here would happen very quickly. But the problems that you would be solving would be NP-hard problems - think traveling salesman, knapsack problem, graph coloring problem. This will unlock huge amounts of increased efficiencies for classical computing.

Suppose that your algorithm has some kind of fourier transform in it, and the quantum fourier transform is exponentially faster than the fast fourier transform.

6534,"No, that would not be sufficient either, for two reasons:

One, cross-talk is likely not the main culprit here, for an error pattern that you are seeing in your data (streaks seem to indicate poor performance by individual qubits). However, even if the rest of the qubits are not in a prepared state, they are still physically connected to the qubit that you are interested in. That means that any stray microwave noise that is picked up by them would be coupled to your interested qubit. 

One example that might help to visualize that is to picture a bunch of people sitting in cubicles, working on their tasks. Each person is supposed to work on their individual task, but there are some holes in the walls for people to pass their work from one person to another. Those holes are necessary for the overall office to work well, but because of them, you might get distracted doing your work by your noisy coworkers and his loud sighing. Choosing to not prepare the other qubits is a bit similar to just not assigning tasks to the other 15 coworkers. They are still there, in their cubicles, and they might still fidget around even without work. Therefore, their sighs and squeaky chairs can still affect your quality of work.

Two, quantum decoherence is a very hot research topic, and people are not entirely clear exactly why it happens. Right now, there is a limited amount of time that your qubit stays coherent for - it tends to be on the order of hundreds of microseconds for the best superconducting qubits. Because each gate takes time, the more gates you run, the more likely your qubit would have decohered by the end of the operation. Some qubits, due to very small fabrication defects, have better or worse coherence times than others, or respond differently to the gates that they are passed.

Put in the same analogy as before, your individual workers have a limited attention span. Let them sit alone for too long, and they will get bored and not be working as effectively. Give them too many tasks to do, and they will also burn out. A very active research topic is to make those workers have either longer attention spans (longer coherence times), make the work that is given them shorter and faster (faster gates), or allow them to refocus after a while (quantum error correction).",1589122201,QuantumComputing,seattlechunny,Quantum,Comment,405
6535,"This is true and accounted for. Experimentalists are not supposing that any of their gates are perfect. Instead, for their own systems, they would have doe a test very similar to what you have done - repeatedly measure a single gate over and over and over again, and get a better understanding for what the error bounds on their gate would be. Then, when they do any quantum chemistry simulation, for example, the error analysis for their project would have included this type of error. 

One way of thinking about this is if you had a ruler that wasn't exactly perfect when building a house. You would like a perfect ruler, but you know that this ruler has maybe a 0.1 inch uncertainty when you are measuring something. Would you stop building the house altogether because it isn't perfect? Probably not - instead, you would try to include measures to prevent that from affecting the overall integrity of the house. It might not be the platonic ideal of a house, but it would still be mostly the same function.

(Alternatively, one other way of doing a similar test is to run two back-to-back Hadamard gates on every single qubit repeatedly. As you might know, a Hadamard gate run on a perfect superposition should return exactly the original qubit. So, if you had initialized everything in the |0&gt; register, then running H, H on every single qubit should return everything to the |0&gt; register. My guess is that this would not be exactly true if you run a very large number of shots. In addition, if you keep on doing this - ie, 4 pairs of Hadamards, and 6 pairs, and 8 pairs, you will see a slow degradation of the signal, as errors accumulate over both time, as well as increased number of gate operations.)",1589121615,QuantumComputing,seattlechunny,Quantum,Comment,305

From a mathematical perspective, a Hadamard transform is used to prepare each qubit into a superposition, with the guarantee that when observed each qubit will provide either a classical 1 or 0 result with evenly split probability.

In a sense, you could think about each possible answer having its own “frequency” in that each possible answer has its own component of the overall wavefunction.  You can cause “interference” by performing a quantum gate that causes different components of the wavefunction (different possible answers) to interact.  The difficulty in developing quantum algorithms is figuring out what quantum gates you can run such that this interaction or produces an answer to a useful question.


[Grover’s search algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) can be described as defining a quantum gate you can run so the answers to the question “what inputs to the black box produce the output 1 instead of 0” will “constructively interfere” and that potential answers that do not answer the question will “destructively interfere”.

That's a funny way to say it, but... kinda? If you can set up a superposition that is an oscillating wave where the frequency of the oscillation is the answer you care about, you can then measure that frequency in order to get the answer. This is how Shor's algorithm works, for example. In classical computing this is not a viable strategy because there's no way to prepare a superposition and even if you could you wouldn't have the operations needed to measure its frequency.

Of course the tricky bit is finding problems where you can prepare a superposition that oscillates at a frequency encoding your answer, without needing to know that frequency to prepare the superposition in the first place.",1589080831,QuantumComputing,Strilanc,Quantum,Comment,133

Oh I agree 100%.

No, not if it's completely random. In a completely random distribution, there are no repeated observations, just a fine mist of coordinate vectors evenly spread throughout the search space. A PRNG will always repeat, it's just that the quality of entropy gathered for the seed, and the complications in the PRNG itself that cause the pattern to not repeat for hundreds or thousands of years, make it infeasible to model from a function approximation standpoint.

Operating system vendors are still to this very day grappling with things like insufficient entropy on boot (Linux OS variants), whether or not to halt the boot process etc.

Put another way, here's a funny true story. I sent an FOIA to the State of Florida a while back, requesting the specifics for the PRNG chipset used in Florida's lottery terminals. Because statistically the lottery shouldn't ever roll over five and six times if a) people were largely selecting numbers from the entire possible search space, or b) if the Florida Lottery was using a cryptographic PRNG for how they issue Quick Picks.

They completely flipped out, literally. Had their general counsel all over me, certified mail correspondence, citing to a bunch of privacy regulations that completely immunized the entire Florida Lottery from any public disclosure. So I did a bit more digging, only to find out that all of the Florida Lottery executives had been appointed to the Lottery Commission by Jeb Bush, from the lottery terminal machine vendor. After a bunch of back and forth, they finally agreed to give me one single thing, which was their outside auditor report on the PRNG used for each Florida Lottery gaming terminal, and it was a simple chi squared report that they probably paid a million bucks to generate.

So the moral to the story is twofold: 1) people are so lazy, they don't even fill out the bubbles on lottery tickets using a pencil, they just say ""give me ten Quick Picks and trust the machine and process to be honest without ever questioning anything; 2) ergo, if you want to rig the lottery, all you have to do is use a fundamentally weak method of handing out Quick Picks, which reduces the entire possibility of numbers being purchased in the form of lottery tickets, and which causes the lottery to roll over which means everybody plays over and over and the state gets trillions.

The way teleportation works in Star Trek is that you destroy an object at one location, and store all the information about how the object is put together. Then you use that information to reassemble the object at a different location. 

Now, if you didn't have quantum physics, just classical physics, this should in principle be possible, you just need to know everything there is to know about the object, and then have sufficient control to be able to put it back together again. The thing is, quantum theory tells us that we can't know everything there is to know about the object. If my object obeys the laws of quantum mechanics, I know that by measuring one feature, I lose the opportunity to measure some other feature.  So the question becomes, can we still perform the kind of teleportation that you see in Star Trek, given this restriction.

The quantum teleportation protocol says the answer is yes, as long as you share enough entanglement with the place you want to recreate your object. Using the entanglement, you can make some select measurements, store the information, and then recreate your quantum object on the other side.   


Now, you might argue, this isn't true teleportation, since you are not instantaneously making matter dissappear and then reappear somewhere else. But that isn't how teleportation works in Star Trek.

But what if our information is stored on quantum bits in superposition states, that is, not classical information? Well, the No-Cloning theorem says we cannot just copy the state of this qubit and send it some place else. Then let's consider the case where someone far away from the qubits where the information is stored needs it in order to perform some computation, then they would have to perform all the complicated operations in their labs in order to obtain a qubit in that state, and even so, we cannot say that the resulting state would be the same as the qubit far away because of quantum errors during the process. And now comes the quantum teleportation, with it the person far away would not need to perform anything but a single rotation in their qubit (previously entangled with a second qubit near the one where the information is stored) to obtain the exact same state as the original qubit (which will have collapsed by then), and it would, evidently, require more time than light would take to travel between the two places but that is not the point because quantum teleportation is not about speed of transmition of information, but about the possibility of sending quantum information phisically throughout space.",1588990529,QuantumComputing,adonaianoda,Quantum,Comment,297

6620,"I don't know if I would say it is about speed and number of operations. I would say it is more about the amount of ""resources"" you have to send to the other party. Here resources may be classical bits of information or quantum resources (e.g., qubits).

Let's look at an example: if you are 100 miles away from me and I want you to recreate a quantum state that I have (ignoring the possibility that it is entangled with some other particle -- let's assume a pure single qubit state).  For the sake of choosing a particular example, let's choose a qubit encoded in the polarization state of a photon. There are two ways for you to recreate that state: classically and using teleportation. 

Now a single qubit pure state is defined by a point on a sphere (see: Bloch sphere). Using teleportation, I would take a pair of entangled photons in a Bell state, send you one photon, and perform a Bell measurement on the other photon from the Bell state and the quantum state I want to send you. Then, I would send you the result of that Bell measurement (two bits of information). Overall, I sent you two classical bits and half of an entangled pair. What will you have to do to recreate the quantum state? Perform one of three possible transformations on the photon you receive. This would be done using one or two waveplates. The result would be the exact quantum state that I had with an arbitrarily high precision with only two classical bits of information and a qubit being sent to you.

Using classical information, I wouldn't have to send you a quantum resource. You could start with a photon of your own. You would receive a string of classical bits that define the point on the Bloch sphere with as much precision as you want. So, probably at least -- what? -- 128 bits? 256 bits? Then you would take that information and find a corresponding setting for the same two waveplates and prepare the quantum state. 

So, the number of operations performed by you is pretty much the same in both cases (pass a photon through a couple waveplates, the orientation of which is determined based on the classical information you receive from me). The speed is also pretty much the same. Obviously it takes slightly longer to send 256 bits than 4 bits. But it is all just the speed of light over the 100 miles distance between us. Again, the operations you perform on your qubit to get the result are pretty much the same in both cases.",1588965683,QuantumComputing,Replevin4ACow,Quantum,Comment,441

6624,"You are basically correct. To teleport a quantum state you need a classical communication channel. So, ultimately, no information is being conveyed instantaneously -- it still requires a message sent at the speed of light (or less). 

The one nuance you may be missing is that the quantum state, in theory, is a true quantum state; |psi&gt;= a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;, where a and b are complex numbers. To send that information classically so that someone could prepare that state you would need more than one bit of classical information. In fact, you would need an arbitrarily large amount of classical information depending on how precise you want to create the state. Moreover, the quantum state that you are teleporting may be already entangled with some other particle. Classically, there would be no way to remotely prepare a state that is entangled with a distant particle. With teleportation, you can (see: entanglement swapping). 

How much classical information is needed to get quantum teleportation to work? Well: you need to send the result of a Bell measurement, which can have four outcomes. So, two bits of classical information. 

In other words: you can send a precise copy of a quantum state to a remote location by sending (1) one particle of an entangled pair and (2) two bits of classical information.",1588961604,QuantumComputing,Replevin4ACow,Quantum,Comment,219

6626,"Hello! That's great that you are already pursuing physics - that's going to definitely keep a lot of options open!

Right now, I think the best thing that an undergraduate can do is to get as much experimental research experience as possible. For instance, if you are interested in trapped ion quantum computing, work in any kind of AMO type lab, even if it is on cold atoms or rydberg atoms. You will start to develop the experimental skills necessary to do well in industry. If you are interested in doing superconducting quantum computing, then having some experience in electrical engineering would be incredibly helpful, as circuit QED relies a lot on basic EE concepts. I would also highly recommend taking an algorithms course - intro CS isn't particularly useful, but knowing how to compute classical algorithm running times is really crucial for understanding quantum advantage. 

I don't know what year you are, and coronavirus makes things especially complicated. However, pursuing research internships at the qc companies (IBM, Rigetti, IonQ, QCI, etc) would definitely be a really valuable experience. Look for the University of Waterloo's IQC program as well, and check out the NIST SURF, especially the ones at the Boulder campus, where there is a lot of research in quantum metrology that is very relevant. 

In terms of further education - I do think that there is some sort of cap in regards to what you are able to do without a PhD. That being said, I definitely have found value in working between undergrad and grad school!

6643,"I am not quite sure what do you mean by a ""supremacy circuit"", but will give my two pennies nonetheless. Also, I am not an expert, but a Masters student in this area. 

If you mean the recen Google's quantum supremacy claims, those were done by computing RANDOM quantum circuits, so not sure if there is any artifact of a quantum circuit per se that one could name ""supreme"" -- it is more about the characteristics of the device.

If you mean generally which circuits perform better that their classical counterparts, this is a more involved question I think. It is not proven that quantum circuits are better than classical generally -- that can also be stated in terms of complexity classes, for example we don't know whether BQP contains NP. So it is stricly said not proven that quantum computers are better than classical ones -- we just don't know the efficient algorithms for certain stuff in the classical case (and maybe these algos don't even exist!) But for now this seems as enough justification to try and build a quantum computer because we are relatively sure that one can build such computer with enough money and time, and we are also quite unsure if one can find efficient classical algorithms.

So I guess my answer is if you see a Quantum Fourier Transform, or Rotation of subspaces a-la Grover algorithm, this is a good hint that there is no classical algorithm known that is equally fast. There are other algorithms, such as Quantum Walks, Variational Quantum Eigensolver, and many others. You may even discover a new one yourself!

One particular approach to look at it: Suppose we have a closed quantum system S. Its dynamics will be unitary and governed by Schrodinger's equation. Now it starts to interact with a bigger quantum system B. Now the whole system S-B will follow the unitary dynamics (considering that they don't interact with a third system), and in other words, you can say that both systems are entangled. Now when you just look at system A, it no longer follows the unitary dynamics. This non-unitary dynamics is essentially what causes decoherence of the system S.  

Quantum measurement is one such example where the system interacts with the measurement probe causing the collapse of quantum state of the system. (Though Quantum Decoherence doesn't necessarily solve the measurement problem).

I wanted to also explain it mathematically, but Wikipedia already explains it really well.

I would think that the schools where is going to be probable are schools with professors that are more on the theory side.  There aren't many schools that have any faculty that do Quantum Computing theory, but here are some of the more prominent ones that come to mind:

University of Waterloo (IQC/Perimeter):  There's tons of faculty working on quantum algorithms and information theory.  There's Watrous and Cleve in the CS department, Ashwin Nayak and David Gosset in Combinatorics, and perimeter has Daniel Gottesman.  IQC (I think) has the biggest concentration of faculty in every area of quantum computing.  

University of Texas:  UT Austin has Scott Aaronson, maybe the most famous quantum computer scientist.  John Wright is also headed there next year, so they'll have 2 faculty in the area.

Caltech: Caltech has Thomas Vidick and Alexei Kitaev, two big names in the field.  Vidick (I think) has become pretty well known since the MIP* paper.

UC Berkeley: UC Berkeley has Umesh Vazirani, one of the OGs of quantum computing.  

University of Toronto: Henry Yuen is here.  He's was a prominent figure before the MIP* paper, but now he's even more well known.

CMU: Ryan O'donnell does work in the field (mostly with John Wright though), although most of his work is related to circuit complexity.  

University of Maryland: Andrew Childs is here.  I'm not very familiar with his work, but I've definitely heard of him.  

University of Chicago: Bill Fefferman is a new faculty there, I've heard good things about him and he seems to be looking for students.  

Those are just some of the names that were on the top of my head.  All of them are in the CS (or combinatorics) departments of their respective schools, so those schools definitely have Quantum Computing research that's oriented towards computer scientists.  You would also be in the CS department, which would probably allow you to avoid some of the experimental courses that physicists take.  I would recommend reaching out to those programs to see if they offer what you want.  

If you're doing a research based masters and want to do research in algorithms, these are some of the programs I would recommend taking a look at.

It is, and that's OK. It helps no one to have an unhappy and unsatisfied something10294 as a husband or father.

The idea that everybody has to pursue money is terrible. Having enough is good enough.

&gt; How many competition would I find in industry with a PhD in Quantum Computing and Information?

Right now, we're close to peak hype, so with a PhD you can very easily find a position in the quantum computation industry. In 4 years we may be in the [trough of disillusionment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle), in which case things will be hard. But you always have the option to going into non-quantum programming. They absolutely love physicists over there.

&gt; ... travel ...

You control how much you travel. With the exception of the time kids are small and require constant attention, I actually find traveling 1 week a month can do good for a relationship - it gives us space to ourselves, and space to miss each other. And it strengthens the relationships with the kids - because they know Daddy is going away but he's always coming back - this is somehow stronger than ""always there"". Everything is taken less ""for granted"". Or at least this is how I feel about it.

The last part of your comment about money and travel is what bugs me. Even though I'd like research a lot, I do not feel like sacrificing the future financial and geographical stability of an eventual family just because I like doing that.

It's weird to many, but I feel like getting a PhD would be a selfish choice with respect to a family I still don't have and see in a near future. These are the attraction poles I'm torn between: either taking a ""selfish"" risk because of passion or just settle, living a more ordinary life but with the chance of regrets.

I'm sure I'm probably exaggerating about family issues, but I've seen many of my professors being apart from family and seeing sons only twice a month. That'd be hell for me. On the other hand, this is not the only outcome of a PhD, I can always go to industry (after a postdoc if I got it right).

If you like digging to the bottom of problems to an obsessive degree, if you like the feeling of suddenly understanding something at the price of spending most of your time dealing with things you don't fully understand, if you prioritize interest and freedom over money - do science. And PhD is the path. 

If interest is not a much stronger motivation than money, find balance by going to work for a quantum computing company, or just anywhere in high-tech.

There is no going around it - to have a career motivated by interest, you'll have to make compromises.

6749,"The short answer is no. I don't think one would be able to make such a strong claim.

But. This is really a two-fold question, because there are really two classes of alternatives to MWI. One class are obviously modified quantum mechanics, and the other class are what seem like simply alternative interpretations.

The first class include for example spontaneous collapse theories. So the question is then to what degree do large sustained superpositions rule out spontaneous collapse theories. This seems like an entirely answerable question that I have not sat down and worked out. There's probably room for a moving goal post. But it is likely that at some point either quantum computers will fail or they will go past the furthest goal post.

As for other interpretations, I think this is much more subtle. If you know quantum mechanics , and you believe quantum mechanics can be scaled up, then you can predict that quantum computers can do extra powerful stuff like factoring. And you can do this without relying on an interpretation. But I think even committing to the notion that you can create an arbitrarily large superposition sits better with some interpretations than others. Additionally, if you discover this capacity for quantum computers to do extra powerful stuff, this seems to demand some kind of ontological commitments, that quantum computers have different causal powers than the rest of the stuff in the classical world. Of course we already knew that quantum states have this, but this really forces the issue. For example, how do radical subjectivist interpretations like qbism account for these different causal powers, when their entire ontology revolves around the human act of observation, which remains the same wether I'm looking at a classical computer or a quantum computer? 
The point is that the interpretations live and die largely by how they help us make sense of what is going on, not by what kinds of experiments rule them out. This has also been true in the past. Take for instance Ptolemaic vs Copernican models of celestial motion. Ptolemy had a model whereby celestial bodies could be modeled by circles within circles within circles. While Copernicus had a model which moved the sun to the center of the solar system. Ptolemy could always refine his model so no experiment could rule it out. But that's not very useful for making sense of things. So this is a meta-scientific criterion. All interpretations are subject to these kinds of criteria.


Also as an aside. Most people will be very quick to tell you that all quantum interpretations give the same experimental predictions. The problem with this claim is that no one has really exhaustively enumerated all the predictions of all the interpretations. In part because the interpretations are really frameworks for how to think about scenarios where quantum mechanics doesn't make predictions. This is why cosmologists like Sean caroll likes MWI, because it can formulate notions like the wave function of the universe. Also, many interpretations are incomplete. For example it is not currently clear, at least according to my limited understanding, how Bohmian mechanics can be made reletavistic and be reconciled with QFT. Or for example, it is not clear how to derive Born's rule in MWI (to be fair to MWI, the reason for this is that MWI sees it as something needing explanation while many other interpretations simply inject Born's rule as a base fact) So although these ideas may seem to be just different interpretations, it may turn out that they give rise to completely distinct physical theories with testable distinctions in the right domain.",1588498812,QuantumComputing,roundedge,Quantum,Comment,603

6755,"&gt; if you're going into the industry you don't necessarily need a PhD

Some jobs in QC do not explicitly require a PhD, but the industry is cluttered with PhDs trying to get in, so you'll better have one if want a chance at it. 

Also, I think counting ""lost wages"" is a bad idea, wageslaving isn't a good advice. Especially considering that PhDs and postdocs are all payed.

&gt; will what you learned in your PHd be relevant to industry a few years from now?

6756,"Well I only have a M.Sc. in physics (thesis on open quantum systems) and decided not to pursue a PhD, but I'll try to answer best I can based on my personal experience. 

1) To my knowledge, GRE is only required to access USA universities, I haven't seen any university in Europe requiring it, though it surely is something more to add on your CV. About the papers, it's not so common to publish a paper based on just your master thesis, especially in mathematics and physics, and usually you master thesis work is continued as part of your PhD and eventually published as part of your first paper. Of course, having already a paper published is considered a solid point in your favour.

2) I scanned the industry for a while just to have an idea how it's doing. A PhD is required most of the times, but consider that there's a lot of competition as there are very few places who are doing actual work on quantum computing, and pretty much all of them are in the US. Also, considering you come from a computational background, the jobs in quantum computing might not be what you actually think of (i.e. most of the jobs are in experimental/hardware or theoretical research).

3) Family is certainly an issue. During your PhD you're expected to visit universities and conferences, but the problem is mostly after the PhD. If you decide to pursue a postdoc and an academic career, you'll most likely move city/country every 1/2 years for a while before you can get even the slightest stability as an assistant professor. 
About the jobs, a PhD doesn't directly translate to a better job, but from what I know most companies do take it into considerations as a solid background, especially if it is in a scientific/technical field.

In my opinion, you should just pursue what you like, but it's a good idea to know the downsides. Just keep an eye out for possible jobs and paths to take, in case the researcher life doesn't fit you, and you won't have problems finding a job.",1588462139,QuantumComputing,lbranco93,Quantum,Comment,353
6757,"It depends on what you want to do career-wise. Doing a PhD could be a waste of time depending on what you want to do or it could open doors.  I would suggest you go on LinkedIn and search people with the type of career you want (focused on people just starting &amp; people in the senior roles you want to be in later on in life), you can then have an idea of what you need for your career to progress).

You can also go on publicly available government &amp; industry databases to see what the salary difference is between doing an MSc &amp; PHd in those roles ... it's easy to find (as well as the difference between career choices... and the differences in salaries are big).  For example the Global SPIE salary guide for people in photonics:  [https://spiecareercenter.org/survey/2019/11](https://spiecareercenter.org/survey/2019/11) 

You should also consider the lifestyle that you want... do you want to work with a cutting edge start-up tech... they likely won't care... do you want to be stuck in the lab doing research or out meeting with people?  I got BSc in Physics, then an MBA and my career is focused on technology matching  (sales-biz dev // product management)... I get to travel all over the world and work with researchers and engineers... I didn't want to be stuck in the lab or in front of speadsheets.  

At the end of the day you need to look at the options available to you, assign probabilities (of that happening) and your interest in making that happen.

A functional quantum computer confirms MWI in-so-far as you believe that large scale unitary evolution of quantum systems (ie unmodified quantum theory) implies MWI. Many professional physicists believe this, and many do not. 

The crux of the disagreement is not one that can be resolved by any experiment, the problem is about the philosophy behind what theories are, how we should interpret them, and how they relate to the scientific method. This is no small matter, and anyone who tells you that all interpretations are equivalent is basically telling you that they don't care about these questions. A clear exposition of why one should prefer MWI, based largely on arguments related to thoery intepretation etc. is given [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hc9Eg6erp6hk9bWhn/the-quantum-physics-sequence). In particular, you can find a good response to this idea that MWI is vacuous because it makes no new predictions in one of the [essays](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DFxoaWGEh9ndwtZhk/decoherence-is-falsifiable-and-testable) there.

Even so, there are some modified quantum theories which do begin to become ruled out as we make bigger quantum computers. In particular, spontaneous collapse models, whereby quantum states undergo spontaenous wavefunction collapse (independent of observers) the larger they become, become less and less likely.

One important question that the existence of quantum computers force is, where does the extra computational power come from?

6800,"I’m glad you brought that up—I think Quirk is fantastic and really sets the bar with its list of gate operations and inspection tools. It’s an inspiration. 

Where Q compares favorably is its ease of visual re-editing, particularly multi-qubit operations, on both desktop **and touch devices.** Q allows you to easily select and **drag multiple gate components at once** to new locations. And the Undo / Redo buttons ensure that mistakes or changes of heart are easily managed. To me that’s important as I find coding / circuit editing to be a medium of expression; working through the problem sometimes changes the way you want to approach it. I didn’t want to undervalue that process of finessing / futzing.

Another standout feature is the **ease of jumping between a visual editor and code.** If there’s an interactive circuit editor on the page then that circuit is directly available from the JavaScript console. Check out the “Playground” page here, for example, and open up your browser’s JavaScript console: [https://quantumjavascript.app/playground.html](https://quantumjavascript.app/playground.html)

Note how the circuit is accessible via `$('#playground').circuit`. This allows you to directly code changes to your circuit, to diagram it with `$('#playground').circuit.toDiagram()`, export it for other quantum simulators, and even inspect your undo / redo history with `$('#playground').circuit.history.report()`. 

And because the visual editor is always “listening” to the circuit, changes via code will always be immediately reflected back in the visual editor.

Something I haven’t highlighted yet, but will in a near-future release, is the ability to have **multiple circuit editors editing the same circuit.** This may at first sound superfluous, but if you’re working on a long circuit and wish to copy and paste a group of gates from the beginning to the end it’s nice to have two editors open, one above the other, with one scrolled to the start and one scrolled to the end; just drag and drop from one to the other. It’s also convenient if you just want to double check what you’ve done at the beginning of the circuit without mentally losing your place where you’re making edits further along.

There’s also an element of Q that isn’t part of the library itself, and that’s the **concise explanations of quantum basics** that appear right in the documentation. What is a qubit exactly? Well here’s the answer: [https://quantumjavascript.app/Q-Qubit.html](https://quantumjavascript.app/Q-Qubit.html)

I could go on about the ease of [text-as-input](https://quantumjavascript.app/#text-as-input), [importing / exporting circuits](https://quantumjavascript.app/#Import_and_export), etc. but I’ll cut myself off here and just say that 1.

Microsoft's money is behind topological quantum computing which encodes qubits in exotic non-local fermions; non-local qubits means immunity to local noise. Google went the route of scalability, using good old fashioned superconducting qubits. I believe IBM went the same route. D-Wave's approach to hardware is different because they are aiming for a totally different computational paradigm: quantum annealing. Trapped-ion computers are another approach out there, don't know anything about it. And something something photonics. There are lots of ways to make a qubit.

My guess is that the 'best' approach will slowly reveal itself as we better understand:

* How to mathematically describe the fundamental advantage of quantum computers and understand where the advantage shows up. (Rather than discovering one quantum algorithm at a time)
* Characterize the class of problems that quantum computers, quantum annealing, etc. are good at (i.e. quantum complexity theory)
* Quantum error correction theory, which might make noisy but scalable qubits more viable
* Limits of superconductor technology (magical, room-temp, cheap graphene qubits when?)
* Majorana modes (used in the topological approach)

There will be hardware improvements that will put down planks out into that chasm, but it is unlikely we will be able to bridge it any time soon.

Especially because a classical computer can emulate the short time quantum  computation up to just before the very edge of those planks.

It is a matter of engineering, solving problems like error correction to build a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, but we already have the math to prove that many public-key encryption algorithms will be in trouble the day that computer will be ready.

But for symmetric-key encryption algorithms, which can be solved with Grover's algorithm that provides only a quadratic speedup - e.g. AES256 can be computed in times comparable with AES128 on classic systems - it is not just a matter of building better quantum computers: we simply does noy (yet?) have and algorithm that would make them so easy to solve on a quantum computer to be considered insecure.

Nope.  But have done alright for myself.   I am old and have a huge family as in 8 kids.  So I do need a decent amount of money to keep everyone happy.  

&gt; Priorities show a persons or peoples personality.

Would say that is mostly true.   My top priority has always been my family.  But I have been wired like that at a pretty young age.   

Long before I had any money.  Honestly a priority of family transcends financial class.   Rich people family is important.  Poor people family is important.   Black, white, brown, gay, trans, etc.  Family is the common element.   As well as friends.

&gt; So reversing all damage caused in last 40 years. Not a priority. 

I am NOT aware of any damage.  I think our world today is simply incredible.   It is amazing the things I can do with technology and the Internet.  It has made my life a lot better.

Again missing how relevant?    

&gt; The advancement in everything seems to be in equipment, tools, but not in psychology of the people. Break it all down. Same society for thousands of years with better tools

Could not disagree more.   It is much more common for someone to see a psychologist or psychiatrist today then in the past.  It is much more socially acceptable.

Part of the reason that it is more common is wealth.   More people have the money to be able to send someone to see a psychologist.

But it is so much more.  I love how on Reddit someone young and confused can reach out and find others in a similar situation.    It must make things so much easier than when I was growing up.

Those qubits have ~ 6 GHz frequencies and 1K is ~ 20 GHz so you see the problem there. You can get around this by some active initialization scheme, which is what people in ""hot"" spin qubits and room temperature NV centers have been doing. But it costs more because you need some way to take an arbitrary state and map it to the same initialized state. Some work in very low frequency superconducting qubits has been done where this is necessary even at base temp of a dilution refrigerator but it isn't trivial.

Going higher frequency for the qubit in principle could make life better at higher temperatures but in practice this is very hard because the materials losses get worse with increasing frequency. This hurts the scheme superconducting qubits use more-so than spins due to their nature as nearly linear LC oscillator networks. I think you also have upper bounds, probably related to cooper pair breaking and/or plasma frequencies of the junctions used.

These qubits are very nice because their footprint is much smaller compared to superconducting qubits enabling you to package many more into a wafer piece. The wafer can be purified to be isotopically pure creating a spin ‘vacuum’ so the qubits have long coherence times. Couple with the potential high operating temperature and you can see why these qubits are promising.

Right now, two qubit gates have been holding these qubits back because of charge noise. But there has been impressive work from Intel, delft, unsw and many others to push these two qubits gates to fault tolerant levels. I am biased because I work on these types of devices but I believe these are a strong contender to compete with superconducting qubits (of course, I believe large quantum processors will be hybrid qubit systems).",1587526624,QuantumComputing,theycallmepumba,Quantum,Comment,180

6942,"Quantum states can be represented as a linear combination of basis states.  In other words, a vector where each entry in the vector is the “probability amplitude” of that basis state.  This means that if you make a measurement in that basis, the state will collapse to one of the basis states with probability equal to the “probability amplitude” squared.  Of course, probabilities like this must always add up to 1 (like how if you flip a coin or roll a die, even if it’s weighted, the probabilities for landing on each side must add together to 1).


In your example, you have a state that is a superposition between the “0” state and the “1” state.  If you were to write this as a vector, you could write [1,1], but that’s not quite right, since now the probabilities add up to 2!  You need to normalize in order for this to be a valid state, and you can do this by making your vector [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].  Because the probability of measuring a state is proportional to the probability amplitude *squared*, this represents a 50-50 chance of each outcome.  The probabilities sum to 1 because (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2 and 1/2+1/2=1.  You could have an uneven probability with a state like 1/2 \*|0&gt;+sqrt(3)/2 \*|1&gt;, which has a 1/4 chance of coming up as 0 and a 3/4 chance of coming up as 1.",1587522906,QuantumComputing,Mazetron,Quantum,Comment,231

6980,"I was just waiting for someone to ask this question. In theory, if you had a quantum computer handle not only the noise issue that comes with QC's but having in the kilo-qubits range (which currently there's about only 150 qubits on Earth currently between Google, Rigetti, IMB, and D-Wave combine), you wouldn't even need to mine bitcoin, with Shor's algorithm or building an algorithm like it, you could just decrypt any wallet you see fit and take bitcoin out of it. 

In practice, it's not even worth the time nor investment to look into as most QC's need a classical computer to deliver data, and the top classical computers on the market still are superior to 'today's' QC's. Don't let google Quantum supremacy scare you, the test they made was one built easily and specifically tailored to QC's.

6981,"Perhaps the quantum computer will be able to produce a simulated reality as good to live in as this one. If you know a particle's position, you cannot know its velocity. Does this tell us something about the limits of knowledge? If the observer seems to be having such a radical effect on the observed, does this do the same? Or is it not perfectly obvious, that if one is aware of an exact position, that its velocity cannot be, since its position would be wherever its velocity took it next? And if its position were radically distant from that spot due to high velocity, wouldn't it needed except in cases of entanglement,  to have travelled each point along the way whether fast or slow, so that one discreet moment could be assigned to that point ts(xy)?

A couple more answers:

* You'll need to pursue a PhD in either physics, math, computer science, or electrical engineering. Unfortunately, computer engineering doesn't really prepare you very well for quantum computing, so you should either try to switch majors or take more relevant classes on the side. There are a ton of threads in this subreddit on how to prepare for pursuing quantum computing.

* Research in general does not pay very well compared to other careers that you can pursue with similar skills. A PhD in particular has a pretty poor payoff financially due to the low pay and opportunity cost during the PhD. But it's livable.

* Ultimately, the supervisor is the most important factor for deciding on grad school. But to know what schools are good, look up all the faculty doing research in quantum computing, and see what universities they tend to be at. Certain schools will have more quantum computing-related research than others.",1586968137,QuantumComputing,SamStringTheory,Quantum,Comment,168
7034,"- If you want to go into research then a PhD is pretty much a requirement. No doubt someone will contradict me and cite some rare exception to the rule, but those are certainly outliers. A PhD teaches you formal research skills which you'll have a very hard time trying to pick up outside of a PhD. Without formal research skills practically nobody will be interested in employing you to do research because you simply won't know how to do it.

- A PhD without funding isn't worth doing. A lot have funding. Don't waste a second considering an opening if it isn't funded.

- You will get paid minimum wage, sometimes less, sometimes a bit more. It's ""livable"", but after years of slaving away doing extremely hard work you might start to resent being paid less than most of the population despite, in my opinion, working a lot harder than most of them. It's a shitty fact of life that PhD students - and academics in general - are paid far less than they are worth and deserve.

- I only really see US students focusing on specific graduate schools (universities?), I don't know why this is. Where I'm from (UK) students will focus more on the project and/or the academic supervising the project. Of course, the university choice will also play a factor, but it is not typically the deciding factor. Personally I would be happy to sacrifice a slightly better university if it meant having a better project/supervisor.

For ZxZ yeah, I can see it's by construction a tesor product of single qubit operators.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning M: I tend to agree. I think the usage of 0 (zero) as eigenvalue messes things up. If instead of M we had M' =  diag(-1, -1, -1, 1) it would still have the same subspace decomposition and it would be impossible to find a, b, c, d such that M' = diag(a,b) x diag(c,d).

Z x Z = (|0&gt;&lt;0|-|1&gt;&lt;1|) x (|0&gt;&lt;0|-|1&gt;&lt;1|)=|00&gt;&lt;00| + |11&gt;&lt;11| - |01&gt;&lt;01|-|10&gt;&lt;10| 

It is by construction a tensor product of two operators.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; M = diag(0, 0, 0, 1) is said to be an example of measurement that cannot  be expressed as tensor product of single qubit measurements.  I do see  the two subspaces of M (S0 = {00, 01, 10} and S1 = {11}) cannot be  expressed as tensor products of single qubit subspaces. But isn't M  equal to diag(0, 1) x diag(0, 1) ?! 

Indeed, M=diag(0, 1) x diag(0, 1) = |1&gt;&lt;1|x|1&gt;&lt;1|=|11&gt;&lt;11|. Simply put, it is an *orthogonal projection* onto the state |11&gt; and it is the tensor product of two Hermitian operators.

On the other hand, this operator does not have support onto the full 4-dim Hilbert space  S which M acts upon. In other words, there is no choice for two eigenspaces S1 and S2 of M such that S=S1xS2.

I am confused by the statement that |psi&gt;=1/srt(2) (|01&gt;+|10&gt;) will be unchanged when measured with M, since |psi&gt; is not in the support of M.

7051,"You can do 1. Take the basis states in the standard basis, so |0&gt; and |1&gt;, and write out the truth table of the quantum gates using these basis states.

For example:

1) CNOT gate performs the equivalent of an XOR: |a,b&gt; is taken to |a,a XOR b&gt;. You can write out the truth table to confirm this.

2) Then you have the very simply X gate which is analogous to the classical NOT gate (again you can write out the truth table).

You can also use the Bloch sphere to show the effect that single qubit gates have on a qubit.

A bit more challenging:

To show certain other gates, you would have to introduce your peers to the concept of ancilla qubits. Remember that classical operations are irreversible, whereas quantum operations are reversible. So for something like an OR gate you would have to explain to them that you need a third ancilla qubit, which contains the result. Here's what you'll need to do

1) Define the Boolean function: f(a,b) = a OR b

2) A gate that takes |a,b,c&gt; to |a,b,c XOR f(a,b)&gt;

3) Set |c&gt; to |0&gt; and then the gate takes |a,b,c&gt; to |a,b,a OR b&gt;

4) For all combinations of |a,b,0&gt; write down what |a,b,a OR b&gt; is. This will help you create the matrix and the truth table

I'm sorry but why diag(0,1) x diag(0,1) = diag(0,1,0,1) ?

diag(0,1) x diag(0,1) in bra/ket notation is (|1&gt;&lt;1|) x (|1&gt;&lt;1|) = |11&gt;&lt;11| i.e. diag(0, 0, 0, 1)  i.e. exactly M, no ?

&amp;#x200B;

Subspace decomposition: I did get the part about degenerate eigenvalues (one eigenvalue of O that can be obtained as different combos of product of eigenvalues of O1 and O2). But that part gives the properties of O (its eigenvalues and subspaces) when O is O1xO2, i.e.when  we already know O a tensor product of two operators.

So OK, I can now see this works for ZxZ: the two eigenvalues of ZxZ are degenerate so carefully picking the eigenvalues of O1, O2  allows to get the O we want (ZxZ).

But If I have an operator (like M), how do I check if it is equal to a tensor product of two opperators O1, O2 looking at O's subspaces ? M has subspaces  S0 = {00, 01, 10} and S1 = {11}, how do I see that at least one of them cannot be written as tesor product of two single qubit subspaces or sum of tensor products of two single qubit subsapces ?

Is it simply has dim(S0) is 3 so that cannot work ?

Reversible computing is a model of computing where the computational process to some extent is time-reversible. In a model of computation that uses deterministic transitions from one state of the abstract machine to another, a necessary condition for reversibility is that the relation of the mapping from (nonzero-probability) states to their successors must be one-to-one. Reversible computing is a form of unconventional computing.

David Mermin's book Quantum Computer Science uses this to introduce the idea of quantum gates.

Note, however, that there are much fewer possibilities for classical gates in this way since classical computing does not allow superpositions of basis states, as quantum computing does.

7072,"This is my non-expert understanding, but here goes. 

The double slit experiment is a great place to start. The basic idea is that if you shoot a single particle through one of two slits, it should shoot straight through and land in one spot on the other side. However it doesn't. The particle goes through both slits simultaneously, forms an interference pattern with itself, and lands in a seemingly random spot on the other side. This phenomena is called superposition.

Superposition is the concept that one single particle is actually a wave of infinite ""duplicate"" particles that exist somewhere mysterious. But when it interacts with our world it collapses into a single particle. The particle appearing in a random spot on the other side is the result of this infinite particle wave collapsing into a single particle. We can observe the result of superposition, but not superposition itself. 

Through shooting many particles, one at a time, through the double slits we begin to see an interference pattern. We can't conclude it's an interference pattern from one particle alone. It's through performing the experiment many times that we begin to see the interference pattern take shape. 

A quantum computer works under a similar concept. The power of a quantum computer is that it finds every possible answer simultaneously since its components (qubits) exist in an infinite state, just like a single particle somehow goes through both slits simultaneously. The problem of a quantum computer is that when those infinite answers leave the quantum world and reaches ours, it collapses into a single answer, just like the particle wave collapsing into a single particle. 

So in order to take advantage of a quantum computer's ability to calculate every answer simultaneously but collapsing into a single answer, clever algorithms need to be designed. You can't find the answer by running the calculation only once. You run the same calculation many times, getting seemingly random answers each time, but  soon a pattern emerges. From that pattern you can infer the correct answer, just like we infer an interference pattern in the double slit experiment.",1586827583,QuantumComputing,thesedogdayz,Quantum,Comment,350

The [quantum phase estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm) algorithm is one of the few successful examples: by making use of quantum superposition it is possible to encode the digits of an (unknown) phase in the local phase for the state |1&gt; of the qubit subspaces (which are indeed in a particular superposition related to the phase). This is then directly related to the famous [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) for prime numbers factorization, which is again at the core of the RSA scheme for cryptography.

To put it in general terms: we start with a quantum gate U, with a certain eigenvector |u&gt; having an eigenvalue e\^{2\*Pi\*i\*phi}. By consecutive applications of a controlled version of U on an n-qubit system it is then possible to obtain a final state proportional to:  
(|0&gt;+e\^{2\*Pi\*\*i\*0,phi\_1 |1&gt;)(|0&gt;+e\^{2\*Pi\*\*i\*0,phi\_2 |1&gt;)\*...\*(|0&gt;+e\^{2\*Pi\*\*i\*0,phi\_n |1&gt;)

where phi\_1,phi\_2,...,phi\_n  are the decimals of the phase phi, i.e., phi=0,phi\_1phi\_2...phi\_n.

HZH =

If the initial state we |1&gt;; then applying the hadamard would give a state (1/sqrt(2))(|0&gt; - |1&gt;).

We’ll call these two state |+&gt; and |-&gt; respectively. Let H be the hadamard and phi(180) be the phase gate. It’s important to note that the phase gate only effects the |1&gt; component and changes its phase from positive to negative and vice verca. Since the Hadamard gate is unitary, and |+&gt; = H|0&gt;, then H|+&gt; = HH|0&gt; =|0&gt;. Similarly for the |-&gt; and |1&gt; states. 

Putting this together, the gate sequence Hphi(180)H splits the initial state into its respective superposition, then flips the sign of the |1&gt; state in that superposition; then “undoes” the superposition. But because of the sign flip, if the initial state before this sequence is |0&gt; then the post-sequence state will be |1&gt;. Similarly if the initial state we |1&gt;.

7131,"no you dont need to do it for 4 different arrangements. 
You are given the arrangement (0+1)(0+1). If you expand it you get (00+01+10+11). 
Now if you apply CNOT i.e CNOT(AB)=(AB') if A is 1.
so for the 4 terms in bracket, applying CNOT to all, you will get, (00+01+11+10) which is similar to the starting state, (00+01+10+11). So you get again the same state system back since you can again seperate the big bracket into 2 small ones like (00+01+10+11) = (0+1)(0+1). Thats it. Done.",1586540032,QuantumComputing,deeplokhande17,Quantum,Comment,86
7132,"Yes. Look at it like that:

Before CNOT you have: 1/sqrt(2)*(|0&gt;+|1&gt;)*1/sqrt(2)*(|0&gt;+|1&gt;)
This itself can be interpreted as the tensor product of two qubits. Each in a superposition of |0&gt; and |1&gt;. If we say the left one is qubit A and the right one is qubit B we can assign an index to our state, which would then look like this:
1/sqrt(2)*(|0&gt;_A+|1&gt;_A)*1/sqrt(2)*(|0&gt;_B+|1&gt;_B)
This here is mathematically a product of two single qubits. So expanding this expression would result in:
0.5*(|0_A,0_B&gt;+|0_A,1_B&gt;+|1_A,0_B&gt;+|1_A,1_B&gt;)
Which is just another way of expressing the state another way. Expanding the brackets does not change the physics. You just did a mathematical routine. 

The reason I did this was to make it more clear how the CNOT works.
One Qubit is the control qubit (Let's say this is A). The other is the target qubit (B then). If qubit A is 1 you will change qubit B. If B is 0 then it gets changed to 1, if it is 1 it gets changed to 0. However if A is 0, nothing happens to B. In short:
00-&gt;00
01-&gt;01
10-&gt;11
11-&gt;10
Applying the CNOT to your input and rewriting the result as a product of single qubits will leave you with 1/sqrt(2)*(|0&gt;_A+|1&gt;_A)*1/sqrt(2)*(|0&gt;_B+|1&gt;_B). 

Fun fact. For this example, the outcome would be the same if B would be the control qubit and A the target.

The point I really want to say u\steve233 nailed is that a masters can be helpful just for surveying the field and determining your interests.

7182,"Sounds a lot like me when I was a third year CS student. I did CS and software engineering and graduated with that degree, but in my third year I wanted to go into quantum information topics.

I did a masters in pure math and now I'm a PhD student as an electrical engineer (only by title, I do only theory). 

To be honest, quantum mechanics doesn't really help that much when it comes to quantum information theory. What would help is taking a functional analysis course and linear algebra.

Anyway, quantum computing is such a young field that no one can be properly prepared for it before they start getting into the research. You'll have to learn a lot of topics as you go along with the research, probably as most research goes in any case. 

I'd say you're already on a really good path by getting research experience early. Unless you want to do lab experiments in quantum optics, I think getting into QC/QI research with a CS/Math background is very doable. Just keep your programming skills sharp and maybe take a functional analysis course. I think delaying graduation to take quantum mechanics courses is not necessary.

Also there are a number of master's programs specifically for QC/QI these days. Check out the one in TU Delft for example in Netherlands, or the one in Canada at U.Waterloo.

Off I do. I have an exam next week 😅",1586136552,QuantumComputing,Olibv,Quantum,Comment,13
7185,"That makes sense.  
At some point you'll get a better intuition on what each gate does to certain states (either by using them many times, or visualizing it on the bloch sphere), to the point where you rarely look back at the raw algebra.  

Some short hand notation to make everything a bit more readable: 

- I'll write H' instead of H ⊗ I.  (This is not standard notation btw, I just made it up)
- I'll skip the normalization again. Sure you need it to be 'correct', but not writing it down makes calculating stuff faster and (especially on reddit comments) clearer.  Don't forget to readd it later on though.  

So we want to calculate H'CNOT(|00&gt; + |11&gt;)  

Two ways to approach this:  
1) H'(CNOT(|00&gt; + |11&gt;)). (First apply the CNOT then the H)  
2) (H'CNOT)(|00&gt; + |11&gt;)  (Combine the Hadamard and CNOT in one gate before applying it)  

(The second way is often easier to do on arbitrary states, since gates are often sparse matrices. But it's harder to build an intuition for them)  

If we write out the matrix multiplication completely:  

The state |00&gt; + |11&gt; in ket notation is [1 0 0 1]^T  

CNOT:  
   
       1 0 0 0
       0 0 1 0
       0 1 0 0
       0 0 0 1

CNOT(|00&gt; + |11&gt;):  


       |1 0 0 0|    |1|   |1|
       |0 1 0 0|    |0|   |0|
       |0 0 0 1| x  |0| = |1|
       |0 0 1 0|    |1|   |0|  

Which is indeed the expected |00&gt; + |10&gt;  

Then to apply H' on that state

We have that H'= 

    |1 0  1 0|
    |0 1  0 1|
    |1 0 -1 0|
    |0 1 0 -1|

([The kronecker product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product))

Applying that on our state:  



    |1 0  1 0|   |1|   |1*1 + 0*0 + 1*1 + 0*0|   |1|
    |0 1  0 1|   |0|   |0*1 + 1*0 + 0*1 + 1*0|   |0|
    |1 0 -1 0| x |1| = |1*1 + 0*0 - 1*1 + 0*0| = |0|
    |0 1 0 -1|  |0|    |0*1 + 1*0 + 0*1 - 1*0|   |0|


The |00&gt; state.   

I am not going to do 2), because I'm already tired of this reddit formatting. Not great for matrices.   
Let's say that is a good practice exercise for you :P


But I want to iterate again that it's much easier to not do the full matrix algebra.  

If you know that:  
CNOT|00&gt; = |00&gt;  
CNOT|01&gt; = |01&gt;  
CNOT|10&gt; = |11&gt;  
CNOT|11&gt; = |10&gt;  

And  
H|0&gt; = |0&gt; + |1&gt;  
H|1&gt; = |0&gt; - |1&gt;  

Then we can already use that to solve it fully  

    CNOT(|00&gt; + |11&gt;) = CNOT|00&gt; + CNOT|11&gt; = |00&gt; + |10&gt;  

and

    H'(|00&gt; + |10&gt;) = 
    (H|0&gt;)|0&gt; + (H|1&gt;)|0&gt;  =  
    (|0&gt; + |1&gt;)(|0&gt;) + (|0&gt; - |1&gt;)|0&gt; =
    |00&gt; + |10&gt; + |00&gt; - |10&gt; =   
    |00&gt;
    

A good way to get an intuition on what a gate does to certain states is to look at its rows.

The first row of the Hadamard gate is (1 1), so applying it on |0&gt; results in 1*|0&gt; + 1*|1&gt;  
Same for second row: (1 -1), so applying it on |1&gt; results in 1*|0&gt; - 1*|1&gt;  

Works for any operation. So give it a try for the CNOT ;)",1586104022,QuantumComputing,pm_me_your_qubits,Quantum,Comment,535

Yes, when the shared bell state has hadamard and cnot gate, then it’s done the other way around for decoding right ?

7187,"So I think what you are trying to do is (H ⊗ I)CNOT(|00&gt; + |11&gt;)?  

Indeed after applying the CNOT first you are left with |00&gt; + |10&gt;  

Now if you apply the H to first qubit:  
 
Note that |00&gt; + |10&gt; = (|0&gt; + |1&gt;)|0&gt; = |+0&gt;  
So if H acts on the first qubit.  
H ⊗ I (|+0&gt;) = |00&gt;  

You have basically reverted the operation to create a Bell pair.
Instead of staring with |00&gt;, and then applying a Hadamard and a CNOT to get |00&gt; + |11&gt;, you did it the other way around.   

(H ⊗ I)CNOT is used in a [Bell state measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state#Bell_state_measurement) btw.  

Also, there are four Bell states.

7188,"Gates could ""act"" on each other in a wall sense. I'll explain what I mean. 

One way to look at how a system evolves in quantum computing is using matrices. In this method winos are expressed as column vectors and gates are expressed as a square matrix of appropriate dimension. In this paradigm, one could just multiply the matrix representation for successive gates. However, this isn't always possible. One of the cases this happens is when successive gates don't necessarily act on the same qubits. Sometimes this could be addressed with some clever manipulation like using identity matrices. 

I hope this helps you look at gates a bit differently. Feel free to DM me with any specific questions you have. Also, I'd the sub r/MikeAndIke.",1586069032,QuantumComputing,X3N0SS,Quantum,Comment,125

As you may know, if you want to get into quantum computing then you should expect to do a PhD in QC (or a very closely related field), since most jobs out there for QC (either in academia, government, or industry) require a PhD. 

Now while your undergraduate will ultimately not matter when you eventually search for jobs after the PhD, it  does matter slightly when you are applying to grad school. In particular, the most important factor will be the availability of research experiences for undergraduates. Ideally, the research would be somewhat related to QC, but it really doesn't need to be, as a lot of people change fields between undergrad to grad school (or even in the middle of grad school).

You should also keep in mind that grad school applications (at least in the US) generally require 3 recommendation letters which should be from professors/faculty that you have worked with. The professor's name will carry a little bit of weight since graduate admissions will trust letters from people with a good track record or who they are familiar with. And finally, prestige of the school does matter slightly, but is one of the less important factors.

But ultimately it's a personal decision on which school you go to. I don't know how common it is for undergrads at Waterloo to interact with the IQC. Keep in mind that over the next several years, your interests may change wildly so you shouldn't necessarily bet everything on the plan of studying QC.

&gt; And what math/cs/physics courses would be needed to study QC at a graduate level.

Depends on if you want to get into the algorithmic side or the hardware side. Obviously QC courses if the school has them, and in general more math is always helpful (at minimum linear algebra, probability). For hardware, you should be getting a full physics curriculum (advanced electrodynamics, several semesters of quantum, maybe solid-state/condensed matter physics, maybe lasers/optics/AMO). For algorithmic side, maybe computational complexity theory, information theory, algorithms, cryptography.",1585758291,QuantumComputing,SamStringTheory,Quantum,Comment,353

7260,"This computer program tackles the problem of searching for the ""shortest"" circuit. 

1. this problem requires an exp(number of qubits) number of operations to ""complete"". So for more than 5-10 qubits, this program is so slow you will grow white hair before it thinks it's finished

2.  This algorithm is not proven to be the fastest for finding the shortest circuit

3. The shortest circuit problem probably has many relative minima. This algorithm is not even guaranteed to find one of the relative minima of the shortest circuit problem. It finds something that looks like it could be one of those relative minima

4. What is the ""shortest circuit"" is debatable and machine dependent

5. The program is written in Lisp, which is definitely not one of the most popular or fastest-growing or newest languages in town",1585731474,QuantumComputing,rrtucci,Quantum,Comment,137

Lets say you look into ID quantique's device. You see something that looks quantum and you have an explanation of what it's doing. You still cant verify that its operating properly, it's not been compromised by a third party into giving you predetermined bits etc. The entanglement based randomness devices that Scott (and also another company called Cambridge quantum) have been working on solve the latter problem.

7337,"/u/exoteuthology is absolutely right! To give some insight into the no-cloning theorem from another angle:

Suppose again that |ψ&gt; and |ϕ&gt; are the two quantum states which U, as defined above, can ideally copy. If we tried to copy some superposition α|ψ&gt; + β|ϕ&gt; of those two states, we would obtain

U(α|ψ&gt; + β|ϕ&gt;)⊗|s&gt; = αU|ψ&gt;⊗|s&gt;+ βU|ϕ&gt;⊗|s&gt;

= α|ψ&gt;⊗|ψ&gt; + β|ϕ&gt;⊗|ϕ&gt;     (Eq. 1)

However if we had truly copied α|ψ&gt; + β|ϕ&gt; we would have obtained

(α|ψ&gt; + β|ϕ&gt;)⊗(α|ψ&gt; + β|ϕ&gt;) 

= α^(2)|ψ&gt;⊗|ψ&gt; + αβ|ψ&gt;⊗|ϕ&gt; + αβ|ϕ&gt;⊗|ψ&gt; + β^(2)|ϕ&gt;⊗|ϕ&gt;     (Eq. 2)

The only ways that (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2) can be the same are if

* α = 1 and β = 0, or vice versa, in which case we have not actually cloned a superposition of the two states that U can copy, but rather only one of the two states above.
* The states |ψ&gt; and |ϕ&gt; are identical, and α and β are appropriately chosen, in which case we still not cloned a superposition, but rather only one of the two states above.

Hence, one cannot use a unitary operation which can ideally clone two states |ψ&gt; and |ϕ&gt; to clone an arbitrary superposition of those states.",1585063265,QuantumComputing,No-Time_Toulouse,Quantum,Comment,201

VC funds are structured like private equity partnerships, and LPs (investors in the fund) commit money for the life of the fund (typically 10 years). LPs would need to sell their interests to another investor on the secondary market to get their money back.

On the startup side, share buyback is generally written into term sheets as ""redemption rights"", but this is relatively rare. Board members also have a fiduciary duty to common stockholders, not to preferred stockholders (which VCs usually are), and forcing buyback could be challenged in court.

Always remember that it is your education and expertise that gives you the best leg up.

7438,"Eh, not really unfortunately. They are theoretically faster in some scenarios, but a classical computer is still faster in most cases. Quantum computers aren't ever going to replace classical ones, they might be combined somehow in the future but who knows.

Quantum computers use qbits, which are basically particles with an up or down spin (0 or 1) but if you get the particles really cold and close together they basically meld into a mixed state of 1 and 0 and aren't individual particles anymore. They are entangled, meaning they all don't know if they are spin up or down because they need to know what all the other particles are first. By applying a field in a way that matches your equation or calculation you're interested in, the particles jump out of the mixed state and back into individual particles with spin up or down and at the lowest possible state of energy for the applied field, and those spins are your answer. It's basically using natural tendency of the universe to reach the lowest possible energy state to do the calculation.

For example, the universe isn't doing any calculations when you throw a ball. We can calculate it's trajectory, but to the universe it just happens to have that trajectory because.. physics.

&gt;In classical computation, code is usually written in a high level language (such as C++), which, for the most part, does not mention bits. Then a compiler of some sort reduces the high level language to bit level instructions.

&gt;Quantum Fog is a tool for writing QC programs in a high level visual language, and then simulating the resulting programs. Quantum Fog can also feed this high level language to Qubiter. (The high level language uses decision diagrams called quantum Bayesian networks, which are discussed elsewhere in this website). Qubiter is a tool that translates this high level language to qubit level instructions which can then be fed to a QC. Hence we call Quantum Fog a quantum computer simulator and Qubiter a quantum compiler.

I’m not suggesting that a chip that can’t be simulated in microscopic detail makes it quantum supreme (in that sense, any classical chip is quantum supreme).


The analogy I am making is that google’s algorithm uses a quantum device to sample from a complicated distribution that is hard to sample from via classical communication.


In a sense, this is what a rock does: microscopic measurements of a rock essentially arise from sampling from a distribution that is too complicated to fully calculate on a classical computer, but the atoms and molecules in a rock interact in quantum ways and give rise to these distributions.


I’m just concerned that Google’s claim of quantum supremacy is more a result of lowering the bar so that they can claim it for publicity than a result of making progress to the point that quantum computers can start beating classical computers at real problems (which is really what quantum supremacy is supposed to mark, at least in my understanding of the term).  I think the first practical application of quantum computers will be a better marker for the start of the “quantum supreme” era.

In my mind, the two most important metrics are probably the ratio of your gate time to your decoherence time, which basically tells you how many operations you can do before you’re hosed. On the other hand, you could have an excellent gate time to decoherence time ratio but have poor connectivity, requiring you to perform a lot more gates to achieve the same goal, which effectively worsens the ratio. This is something that quantum volume attempts to capture. 

However, speed matters. A modest decrease in gate speed could mean your algorithm takes a whole lot longer. So while a machine could have a better quantum volume, it might take a prohibitively long time to do an algorithm if its gates are slow enough.

7683,"In spin qubits, the quantum information is stored in the spin state of some particle - in this case an electron trapped on a surface. But it can be very hard to measure the spin directly, because the magnetic field associated with an electron spin is so weak. However, you can do something called spin-to-charge conversion where, to simplify a bit, if the electron is spin up then it gets put on the left side of the dot, and if it is spin down it gets put on the right side of the dot. The quantum information is now stored in the spatial wave function of the electron, rather than the spin wave function. The electric charge of an electron is much easier to sense than the tiny spin-generated magnetic fields, so we can find out where the electron is and then infer what the spin was. But in doing this, you’ve completely destroyed the spin qubit, scrambling the spin degree of freedom when you do the spin to charge conversion. 

What they do in this paper is entangle the first qubit with an second, ancillary spin qubit. Then you can destructively (spin to charge) readout the second qubit and use that measurement to infer the state of the first qubit. The first qubit has been decohered (its wavefunction has collapsed) but it hasn’t been destroyed. It is still a spin qubit, it’s just in a particular, unentangled state indicated by the ancilla measurement. The ancillary measurement can be repeated. Since it is projective, each repetition should give the same value. 

Ancilla assisted measurement is neat, but it’s not a revolutionary idea. I don’t know if it’s been done in silicon before, but it has certainly been done in other technologies. In fact, ancilla assisted measurement is the basis of nearly all quantum error correction (that don’t use photon qubits). And destructive measurement isn’t that big a deal as long as you have a way to reinitialize the qubits afterwards. 

But, importantly, this is a measurement of the qubit state, and it DEFINITELY “collapses the wavefunction.” It just leaves you with a spin qubit in a definite state (as opposed to a CHARGE qubit in a definite state).",1583301291,QuantumComputing,phi4theory,Quantum,Comment,368

7688,Thank you for the correction. Now I'm confused though. What kind of a state measurement can you get without collapsing the probability wave?

7689,"Not quite. 

This is more to do with a state collapsing due to being measured, rather than because of noise. Here they demonstrate a way to measure the state of the qubit, and get some information without affecting the qubit, in a Si/SiGe platform.

&gt;  
&gt;On quantum cryptography...  
&gt;  
&gt;""I don't see any commercial value in it. I don't believe it solves any security problem that needs solving. I don't believe that it's worth paying for, and I can't imagine anyone but a few technophiles buying and deploying it. Systems that use it don't magically become unbreakable, because the quantum part doesn't address the weak points of the system."" - Bruce Schneier computer security expert, 2008

&gt;Fast forward 11 years...  
&gt;  
&gt;""It's possible that quantum computers will someday break all of them, even those that today are quantum resistant...If that happens, we will face a world without strong public-key cryptography. That would be a huge blow to security and would break a lot of stuff we currently do, but we could adapt.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, I know that quantum key distribution is a potential replacement for public-key cryptography. But come on -- does anyone expect a system that requires specialized communications hardware and cables to be useful for anything but niche applications? The future is mobile, always-on, embedded computing devices. Any security for those will necessarily be software only."" - Bruce Schneier computer security expert, 2019

7691,"Not a physicist, but based on reading the introduction, the current type of qubit will not hold it's spin for any significant amount of time after being measured so you can only really look at the value once. This is not good because noise can get in and change the result that you are reading. The ability to maintain the spin for a little while after reading it allows for it to be read multiple times in case the noise messed up your readings. You could look for the result that comes up most often to filter out the noise. I didn't read the rest of the paper but from the title it sounds like they have been able to maintain the spin for long enough to take multiple measurements.

7820,"Here's [a source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09347.pdf) which talks about it (Published in Nature but here's the preprint). QML (Quantum Machine Learning) has a little bit of roughness mostly because it hinges on so many conditionals in terms of both technology and on actual algorithm feasibility. A large portion of the algorithms make use of the Quantum Linear systems algorithm for matrix inversion (which can achieve logarithmic speeds but with a heavy dosage of [fine print](https://scottaaronson.com/papers/qml.pdf)). 

The biggest problem is most algorithms hinge on the idea of Quantum RAM which is still purely theoretical at this point, and even if that exists you'd need an efficient procedure to prepare the initial state of data that you're working on into a quantum state which is also very difficult. So even if your algorithm runs in O(log(n)) if it takes you O(n^2 ) to prepare the data you've effectively wiped out any speedup. Add to that the fact that you can't copy data so the state needs to actually be prepared every time you want to run your algorithm. The second paper I linked touches on this more in-depth.

People are certainly interested and are working on it, and for now most of these points (QRAM, loading data, etc.) are taken for granted to show that, given that, you can have an efficient algorithm. Because if there are algorithms giving exponential speedups then there's one more reason to work on those things. With that said, you have to also take the usual concerns with a Quantum Computer into account; that is circuit depth and being able to maintain coherence for long enough to have a useful calculation.

With that said, a PhD student has been able to find a [classical analog](https://ewintang.com/blog/2019/01/28/an-overview-of-quantum-inspired-sampling/) for these quantum ML algorithms inspired by the same assumptions (access to QRAM, etc.) and they also give an exponential speedup (once again, with fine print, but much more feasible fine print about the condition of the data used).

So until Quantum Computers develop a bit more, unless something big happens, Machine Learning isn't going to be a groundbreaking application any time soon. Although there has been some NISQ stuff but I think it's more proof of concept (not blowing out a classical computer at the same task) and I'm not too familiar with that.

2. There is no reason to expect that trapped ion gate times will stay 3 orders of magnitude slower than superconducting qubits.

7876,"Tl;dr at the end. I believe it is a natural result of using the inverse Fourier transform prior to the (quantum) measurement. One of the cool things about the Fourier transform is that (picture my hands waving here) it uses properties of infinitely periodic series or signals on non-periodic ones. 

So we take the input to the IFT and pretend 1) It is from an infinitely repeating signal, and 2) It’s one full sample period of that signal. 

Now a lot of analysis is possible, that would be much harder on a single non periodic slug of data. 

However, this is an approximation. When you convert from frequency space back to normal space — or vice versa— in these things, you aren’t working with infinitely extended functions. 

A finite window of a function in frequency space, converted back to the space, will exhibit infinite periodicity.

7904,"&gt; According to the no communication theorem, we cannot use the spin of a particle to send information because whether the spin will end up being up or down is out of our control and It has a random 50% chance of collapsing to each of these states. Fair enough.

This is not exactly right. It depends on the basis that one measures the qubit. If I put my qubit in the |0&gt; state and measure in the ""computational"" basis, the with certainty (given no noise), the output of the measurement is 0. If instead I measure it in the X basis, then with 50% chance the outcome of the measurement is 0 and 50% it's 1. Also it depends on what state the qubit was prepared in in the first place.

7943,"Dr. Who, 

Did you actually study my algorithm yet?  It does exactly what you describe as being done by a black box.  There is no linear search.  Here's what I think you should do.  Read my algorithm (the CSA), and tell me where the linear search is.  I that that exercise will teach you that there is no linear search occurring.

Radix sort has to go through d passes of the items, where d is the number of digits in largest item.  So yes it's O(N) for any fixed d.  But, radix sort is not even defined for on-line creation of the sorted list: it doesn't make sense to present items sequentially (i.e., streaming) to a radix sorter, because if the radix sorter has already received and sorted N items and you then present a new item, the most efficient way to add the new item would clearly be to just find the correct location, e.g., with binary search, and insert it.  Furthermore, since it's not defined for on-line creation of the list, it assumes the unsorted list is already in memory.  And as I said in last message, just adding N items to an unsorted list is an O(N) operation.  

In stark contrast, Sparsey receives N items sequentially, on-line, and creates/maintains the sorted list as it goes.  Each ""insertion"" is O(1).  There are no multiple passes over the items, and no requirement for the unsorted items to already be sitting in memory.

Regarding Grover's and Shor's, yes, of course, they don't work the way Sparsey does.  That's because they assume localist representations, not distributed representations.  There is no need for Sparsey to emulate the specific gates used in localist quantum computing models: they are irrelevant to how Sparsey works.  Also, correct, Sparsey doesn't ""handle entanglement the way \[existing\] quantum computers do""...it handles entanglement in a different way.

You are fixated on me showing how one of the existing quantum algorithms, e.g., Grover's, is done by Sparsey.  That's not necessary.  The essence of quantum computation is that the probabilities of ALL represented (stored) basis states are updated with a number of steps that is constant regardless of how many basis states are stored.  I'm sure if that if you take a survey of QC researchers, they will agree with this as the acid test.  To demonstrate quantum computation, all one needs to do is demonstrate that capability. Again, if you study Sparsey and go through the published examples / simulation results (e.g., [2017 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313059075_A_Radically_New_Theory_of_how_the_Brain_Represents_and_Computes_with_Probabilities)), you'll see that Sparsey meets that criterion.",1582037361,QuantumComputing,rodrinkus,Quantum,Comment,421

&gt; Do you know any other algorithm that creates a sorted list of N items in O(N)?

Well sure: [Radix sort]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort ).

&gt; Again, creating this ""cleverly-constructed superposition of all indices"" is exactly what Sparsey does. In QC terminology that's imposing the appropriate entanglement patterns. In my terminology, that's just ""assigning SDCs so that more similar (as a special case, closer scalar magnitudes on some particular dimension) inputs are mapped to more highly intersecting SDCs.

No. This is not how Grover's Algorithm works. This is not how Shor's Algorithm works. Your model cannot handle entangled states the way quantum computers can. I don't think you actually understand how quantum computation works. Can your system do a **NOT** gate? Can it do the square root of a **NOT** gate: an operation g such that g(g(x))=**NOT**(x)?

You are the one making the extraordinary claim. To prove that ""Representing Probabilities as Sets Instead of Numbers Allows Classical Realization of Quantum Computing"" you need to exhibit a reduction showing how an arbitrary quantum computation can be reduced to your proposed system. This typically involves mapping each quantum operation to corresponding operations in your system, and mapping quantum states to states in your system, and then showing that the mapping commutes.

This is obviously impossible simply because your system has fewer degrees of freedom, even apart from deeper considerations that it cannot do interference or cancellation.",1581970442,QuantumComputing,singularineet,Quantum,Comment,320
7971,"**BQP**

In computational complexity theory, bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) is the class of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances. It is the quantum analogue of the complexity class BPP.

A decision problem is a member of  BQP if there exists a quantum algorithm (an algorithm that runs on a quantum computer) that solves the decision problem with high probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. A run of the algorithm will correctly solve the decision problem with  a probability of at least 2/3.

**Quantum complexity theory**

Quantum complexity theory is a part of computational complexity theory in theoretical computer science. It studies complexity classes defined using quantum computers and quantum information which are computational models based on quantum mechanics. It studies the hardness of problems in relation to these complexity classes, and the relationship between quantum complexity classes and classical (i.e., non-quantum) complexity classes.

7972,Shor's Algorithm is in [BQP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP). There are a few others in [Quantum complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_complexity_theory).,1581961045,QuantumComputing,xanados,Quantum,Comment,14
7973,"Oh, okay, so P and NP are restricted to classical algorithms. Do you know why that is the case? What's the complexity class of quantum algorithms?",1581959864,QuantumComputing,AlrikBunseheimer,Quantum,Comment,26
7974,"Yes, my model takes O(N) to store N items.  BUT, simply storing N items into an **unsorted** localist list is also O(N).  The difference is that Sparsey's storage process results in a **sorted** list.  Do you know any other algorithm that creates a sorted list of N items in O(N)?

But there's more.  Because the ""ordered list"" that Sparsey's (unsupervised, one-shot) learning algorithm \[called the Code Selection Algorithm (CSA)\] produces is actually realized as a set of N SDCs all superposed, finding the best-matching stored item is actually O(1), not the O(logN) that is needed to find best match from a sorted localist list.

Do you know any other model that that has fixed time for both storage and best-match retrieval?

You might be right about the set up of the factoring problem...have to think about it. But the problem of maintaining massive databases and finding the best-matching (or most relevant) stored items is at least as important and, again, much closer (than finding prime factorizations) to the essence of intelligent computation.

Again, creating this ""cleverly-constructed superposition of all indices"" is exactly what Sparsey does.  In QC terminology that's imposing the appropriate entanglement patterns.  In my terminology, that's just ""assigning SDCs so that more similar (as a special case, closer scalar magnitudes on some particular dimension) inputs are mapped to more highly intersecting SDCs.

In fact, Sparsey has a third property beyond fixed time storage and best-match retrieval, which is fixed time update of the **entire** prob. (actually, likelihood) distribution over all N stored items), which is formally more powerful than just fixed-time retrieval of the **single** best-matching (max. likelihood) item.  Fixed-time update of the entire distribution is equivalent to ***simultaneous retrieval of ALL N stored items in descending similarity order***.

(An example of such a black box would be a crypto function, checking if encrypting k yields some known target value.)

Your model has no way to do the initialization (i.e., to store the sparse distributed codes of oracle input-output behaviour in superposition) with less than O(n) work.

A quantum computer, in contrast, can call the oracle once on a cleverly-constructed superposition of all indices 0..n-1.

The whole point is that I don't store items localistically...they are all stored in as sparse distributed codes in superposition.  Sparsey is a type of associative memory.  

I think I see part of the problem here.  It appears you are taking ""sparse distributed codes"" as synonymous to ""sparse coding"" (a la Olshausen &amp; Field).  SDC is a completely different thing from sparse coding.  Barlow/O&amp;F's sparse coding has two defining parts: a) the number of basis elements (features) needed to adequately represent an input space, i.e., the lexicon, is a tiny fraction of the number of possible features definable for that space; and b) the number of features needed to adequately represent any particular input is tiny compared to the lexicon.  These are considerations about the nature of input spaces with natural (1/f) statistics.  It's completely orthogonal to the concept of SDC, which concerns the nature of the code space, not the input space.  Sparse coding is by far the more prevalent concept in the ML literature and many people conflate it with SDC.  Again, they are orthogonal concepts.  Maybe that will help our conversation.

8019,"Again, I have proved it. It's in my papers. The simulation results I give show that a O(1) process updates the likelihoods of all hypotheses (i.e., basis states) in stored in the memory (in [2017 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313059075_A_Radically_New_Theory_of_how_the_Brain_Represents_and_Computes_with_Probabilities)). You don't get to just claim that my model can't be doing what I say, and show, it does, without actually understanding the algorithm and the published simulation results. That's not science.   Actually, start with the [2010 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44799587_A_Cortical_Sparse_Distributed_Coding_Model_Linking_Mini-_and_Macrocolumn-Scale_Functionality), it gives the simplest version of the algorithm.

Yes, a **localist** classical algorithm, i.e., where each of the N items sites in its own individual slot in an **unsorted** list, to find item is N/2.  But Sparsey's storage (learning) algorithm creates SDCs for items that preserves similarity and which are all stored in physical superposition.  Thus, this storage algorithm, which is O(1), creates a **sorted** list. Now, in localist world, retrieving best matching item from a sorted list is O(logN), e.g., binary search.  But Sparsey finds it immediately without search, in O(1) time.  Sparsey does not actually compare the search item to any of stored items explicitly; it compares it to ALL of them at the same time.  And note that this is not done via machine parallelism, but rather what has been called ""algorithmic parallelism"".  I've realized that distributed representation = algorithmic parallelism.  And these in turn = quantum parallelism.

It appears you have never thought of about, or in any case understand, distributed representations, in particular SDCs.  You should.  It has the potential to be an extremely mind-opening experience for you.

8024,"Actually that's the whole point.  What Sparsey's fixed-time learning algorithm does is create sparse distributed codes (SDCs) that have the appropriate intersection patterns with ALL the previously stored codes, i.e., intersections that represent the higher-order similarity structure (not just pairwise, but all order present in the data), over the inputs.  That intersection structure IS exactly what mainstream QC researchers mean when they say that (paraphrasing) 'it's imposing the proper entanglements that's what's so difficult'.

Here's another crucial point about my approach.  My model Sparsey, is an unsupervised learning model, that starts with all weights zero...it knows zero about the input space. Once it starts being presented with a stream of inputs (e.g., video frames), it creates an SDC for each one on-the-fly.  For this discussion, these are are permanent traces, i.e., the involved wts go from 0 to 1 and don't decay (in more general treatment, there is a decay term, but that's a longer discussion (see[2014 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270661782_SparseyTM_event_recognition_via_deep_hierarchical_sparse_distributed_codes)).  So what's happening is the model is building (learning) a basis (a set of basis states) directly from the inputs, and those basis states are the actual inputs experienced.  So in particular, the basis is not orthonormal, nor is there any need for orthonormality.  You may be aware of the more recent research showing that random bases can be almost as good as any designed or learned basis.  Well, if a random basis can do a good job at representing all future inputs, then its not to stretch to see that a basis that happens to consist of (a subset of) the actual inputs observed, might also do a good job at representing all future inputs.  My point here is that if you have come up through the mainstream QC canon, you probably haven't been thinking about the basis states of the observed physical system as being learned form scratch.  I think that's a major mental change of viewpoint that mainstream QC researchers will need to see if they want to understand and evaluate my approach/model.  Lastly, on this point, you might protest that any non-trivial physical system that you observe (e.g., a huge set of videos of soccer penalty kicks for instance) has an exponential set of basis states: why would we expect that simply assigning the first N frames of the set of videos (i.e., N could be large and cover the first multiple videos) as the basis states, would constitute a good model of the underlying dynamical system?  This would take a longer discussion, but the gist is that while the formal number of basis states (for the basis implicitly imposed by the image frame of pixels) is massively huge, of course, the vast majority of those formally possible states have such infinitesimal prob. that we don't actually need to explicitly (physically) represent them.  We may need a sizable set of basis states, but the much more important thing is that we have a fast way for updating the full probability distribution over all the basis states that we do explicitly represent (i.e., all the stored SDCs).  And that's what Sparsey's core algorithm does.

8025,"Wow, you really run your internal world model quickly, but without gathering enough info first.  I built the model years ago and demonstrated its capabilities.  As I said, I demonstrated it in the realm of storing and retrieving information to a memory (database).  So the most direct comparison would be to Grover's.  As you probably know, Grover's finds the item (if its there) in sqrt(N) tiime.  My model finds the item (or the best match) in O(1) time.  You need to read my papers and understand the model before you jump to all your conclusions.  I don't think you should have any difficulty understanding the data structure or the algorithm (essentially the same algorithm, called the code selection algorithm (CSA), does storage (learning), best-match retrieval, and update of the entire probability distribution (fulfills the functionality of the unitary evolution operator of QT).  

Perhaps I was never interested in factoring (specifically finding prime factorizations of huge numbers) because this is not something that human brains do, i.e., not automatically...i.e., not the kind of intelligence exhibited by humans as the unsupervisedly learn about the world.  There's probably a way to apply Sparsey to the factoring problem, but I'd have to think about how to encode the problem into the model.  But that's a low priority for me right now.  Many other more fundamental and important (to me) problems first.

If you wanna continue talking, let's leave the meta-opinions about what I should or should not be doing out of it.  I'd be happy to address any specific scientific question/comment/criticism you may have of the model.  But you'll only be able to generate such if you actually gain some understanding of the model.  Feel free to ask for clarifications along the way if you embark on that.

8053,"The way teleportation works, maybe you know already, I'll just write it anyway, it would use the established entangled pair to transmit the state by performed some set of operations. The sender performs some particular set of operations on their side on the qubit they want to transfer and the one half of an entangled pair, which generates 2 bits of classical information. The sender then sends those 2 bits to the receiver classically who is hold onto the other half of the entangled pair. Based on what those 2 bits are, the receiver performs a set of operations on their half of the entangled pair and in the end, that entangled qubit is now in the state that the sender teleported.

I guess you can't call that eavesdrop-free since the information being sent is classical information, although without that matching entangled pair, it wouldn't be possible to recover the original state in general so one can assume that the qubit state being teleported is unknown to 3rd parties.

The point of using teleportation to send quantum info / qubits over a fibre is that sending quantum information encoded in photons is really ""noisy"", meaning the chance that the receiver receives the photon and decodes it properly gets smaller exponentially fast with the length of the fibre. It's easier in general to establish EPR pairs because you can repeat the procedure over and over until it's successful, and then use classical means to send those 2 bits, which can easily be done.",1581627287,QuantumComputing,steve233,Quantum,Comment,252

8123,"40 not-error-corrected qubits are not sufficient to run Grover with 256bit hashes. You need at least to be able to represent the number, so 256 qubits, moreover you need ancillary qubits to actually perform the calculation: in this paper it is estimated one need 2402 ([https://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/127](https://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/127)). 

Finally, you have to consider that the calculation is not instantaneous, it is made in steps (gates), so you cannot perform the complete calculation using only 2402 physical qubits, because they would decohere before the calculation is done. One needs other auxiliary qubits to perform error correction. With current knowledge, one would need a factor of around x1000 more qubits. So in practice, with current knowledge one would need a QC with about 3million physical qubits. 

By the way, a similar amount of physical qubits would be needed to completely crack ECDSA secp256k1 with Shor. The difference is that Shor's algo is polynomial so that once secp256k1 is broken it is useless to increase keysize, while with Grover it is sufficient to double hashsize to obtain again reasonable mining times (for QC).",1581339851,QuantumComputing,Mquantum,Quantum,Comment,178

Good. You shouldn't feel you could, because you probably can't with your current level of understanding. That is my main fear of something like QISKit. Yeah, you can probably quickly write some quantum algorithms, but they will be entirely useless because you can solve the same problem just as well on a classical computer. Don't build a multimillion dollar large scale quantum computer to make an app that would run faster on your smart watch.

Sinply understanding a reasonable amount of the current algorithms would be huge accomplishment. Write your own novel quantum algorithm? Would probably get a career in the field thrown at you. Shit is really, really hard. 

All that being said, some people very confused about the difference between building quantum computers and what the computational model allows us to compute. Some times they try to teach both, which is a bad approach. If you are teaching this in a CS course, do not worry about hardware approaches. To repeat something I said elsewhere, semi-conductors are crucial to classical computer. Still, we don't teach solid state physics to CS students. The specific nature of the hardware does not matter for people in CS. The computational model does.

Quantum mechanics gives us a new model of information and computation, but it can be described by a handful of equations that are easy to understand if you know linear algebra. When those are understood, physics very rarely come up. Of course, there is the question of how to build them and that's a job for physics. The two are often lumped together which is a huge mistake.

8183,"Mostly no.  The idealized quantum computer is a digital machine, with a discrete state space, and trivial natural evolution.  There's no ""wave"" there, only a collection of things that can only be in one of two possible states.  The abstract space corresponding to this is a vector space with certain properties, of size 2^n.

In practice, people are trying many possible ways of implementing this collection of qubits.  They all boil down to creating an array of systems that are ""well-approximated"" as having two relevant states, and that can talk to each other much much faster than they talk to the rest of the world.  Certain of these might be controlled by and have gates implemented by things describable as waves (e.g. microwave pulses or lasers), but each actual qubit is just something that can be on or off.

Now, it also turns out that something that is quantum-mechanically on-or-off can be represented as a point on the surface of a sphere.  But this is shy of orientation, because it's only fixing one axis.  And for an actual quantum computer you want lots of qubits, and their joint state space is much bigger, and not usefully described with normal 3-dimensional orientations.",1580928348,QuantumComputing,wnoise,Quantum,Comment,201

8185,"It *is* a rotation, but it's not a rotation in actual, physical space.  It's occurring in a very abstract state space.  Planck's length doesn't enter into it.

It is completely reasonable to be concerned about having to make quantum gates too incredibly high precision.  However, all of the error correcting machinery necessary to handle external noise also works on small implementation imperfections.  If a gate is indistinguishable from noise (on *all* possible states) then it doesn't actually do much, and you can even leave it out!  This should be clear when it's at the end of the computation, but it holds for each part prior to that too.  Because unitary operators preserve angles between states, errors don't get amplified through the circuit (though the observed effect of an error if you were to measure at a given point can get larger or smaller).

How this would actually work out for the period-finding quantum subroutine used in Shor's algorithm is a bit messier, of course.",1580923390,QuantumComputing,wnoise,Quantum,Comment,164

8272,"Basically I agree, it's just that your last sentence is phrased a little strange. Not trying to be pedantic, just to clarify a few things.

Supersymmetry is an idea in particle physics. It, among other things, suggests a number of undiscovered elementary particles (I'm sure Wikipedia can do a better explanation than I can). While you're correct that we do use quantum mechanics to describe  atoms and molecules, we certainly also use quantum mechanics to describe elementary particles which is what the supersymmetry discussion is about. There is not a ""contrast"" here.",1580471859,QuantumComputing,The_Serious_Account,Quantum,Comment,92

I believe you can simulate supersymmetry on a quantum computer for the same reason you can simulate it on a classical computer. However, there's no evidence that supersymmetry is correct (natural), so it's not clear that there's any advantage to using a quantum computer. This is in contrast to simulating a system that is well described by quantum mechanics, such as atoms or molecules.",1580444420,QuantumComputing,trappedion,Quantum,Comment,78

And I don't the usual things you read on some medium article like ""Superposition"",""a qubit is a 0 and a 1 at the same time"", ""spooky action at a distance"". Even though they are all true, there is so much more to it than that, you have to get a good grasp of things and how it all came to be and to be honest why do we need quantum mechanics in the first place. However, that is my point of view and I come from the physics side, taking that you are a programmer and are more interested in algorithms I would recommend following Scott Aaronsons [blog](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/) and lecture notes, they may interest you.

8282,"I agree 100% with this. I’m of the understanding that Lloyd did not know of Epstein’s crimes prior to his (first) arrest. After he became aware though, he continued to accept donations from him (as did MIT), which I believe is the crux of the argument.

The article also fails to point out the context. For those who have not followed: Epstein was initially arrested in 2008 for procuring for prostitution a girl below the age of 18, in which he served ONLY 13 months (disgusting, I know). Prior to this, Lloyd and MIT received donations from him. During his prison time, Lloyd visited him and believed Epstein when he said he was sorry and reformed, continuing his relationship and donor relations until his 2019 case.

However, prior to 2008, Epstein had been involved in two very similar investigations, one in which there was evidence of sex with a 14 year old, and a total of 34 minors. In the first trial, he was only charged with “aggravated assault”, the second, he accepted a plea deal which granted federal immunity. 

[In his apology letter](https://medium.com/@sqlloyd/i-am-writing-to-apologize-to-jeffrey-epsteins-victims-eee805c4f13), Lloyd, acknowledges he could have found this all out by through a simple search that he didn’t do, and was under the impressions he was charged with “soliciting prostitution”. At the moment, there is no hard evidence to say that Seth Lloyd had any additional knowledge. As of Jan 10th 2020, he is on paid administrative leave due to his connections with Epstein.",1580425392,QuantumComputing,ejdanderson,Quantum,Comment,247

Normally when multiplying numbers the order doesn't matter.

2*3=3*2

I like to think of that as 2 dimensional.  In the quantum world order does matter.  Think back to colors.

Adding red then blue then green wouldn't matter in any order if painting on paper.  Though if you were lighting a stage the order does matter, as it determines the hue, also opacity (energy) plays into it as well.

In the NISQ era, if we hope to provide some sort of actual advantage for games, we will probably also not be able to just use off-the-shelf algorithms. As for any other application, well have to find some way to encode a relevant problem in the leanest way possible, so that it actually produces results. I haven’t done that for games yet.

We model quantum states as unit vectors in a complex vector space. As per the rules of Quantum mechanics the evolution of the state needs to be linear, and make sure that the output is also a unit vector. This implies that the evolution has to be modeled as a Unitary operation, which by definition is invertible. This means that (without measurement) the evolution of a quantum state needs to be reversible, ie the output state (before measuring) of the system tells you what the input state was.

Classical computing allows us to compute non-invertible functions, like the AND gate. Knowing that the output of an AND gate was 0 doesn't tell us exactly what the input was. We can model non-invertible functions in the quantum framework by a unitary operator whose output contains the input and output of the function. Example to model the AND gate as a quantum gate, it needs a three qubit input, the first two qubits for the input of the AND and the third qubit to store an output, this is the Toffoli Gate:

|00,0&gt; ---&gt; |00,0&gt;  
|01,0&gt; ---&gt; |01,0&gt;  
|10,0&gt; ---&gt; |10,0&gt;  
|11,0&gt; ---&gt; |11,1&gt;  

|00,1&gt; ---&gt; |00,1&gt;  
|01,1&gt; ---&gt; |01,1&gt;  
|10,1&gt; ---&gt; |10,1&gt;  
|11,1&gt; ---&gt; |11,0&gt;  

You'll notice that the output is flipped if the third qubit is |1&gt;. We model it as such so that the Toffoli gate is a valid unitary operator.

Quantum parallelism is when we pass a superposition of states through our gate, it gives us a state that calculates the function value for every input. For example:

(a|00&gt; + b|01&gt; + c|10&gt; +d |11&gt;)|0&gt; ---&gt; a|00,0&gt; + b|01,0&gt; + c|10,0&gt; + d|11,1&gt;

This state contains all of the information about the AND gate, but when we measure the state we only get partial information about the function.

In order for quantum parallelism to be useful to us, we need to be able to extract global information about the function when we measure the system.  
In the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, this information is whether the function is constant or balanced. We're able to get this information when we send a uniform superposition and the |-&gt; state as the gate input.

The math works out using the |-&gt; state, which you can see in the link, but I'm not too sure how they thought of using the |-&gt; state.

TL;DR: Reversibility of quantum systems is inherent to the quantum mechanical model, the |-&gt; state is used to extract meaningful information after measuring the system.",1580003974,QuantumComputing,KnightShuffler,Quantum,Comment,437

My advisor and I have been taking a close look at the Hidden Subgroup Problem with the hope of shedding light on the reasons for the suspected intractability of much of the non-abelian case. Often, I write code to help formulate conjectures, though, that is not the rule. Quantum algorithms are theoretical, so the algorithmic techniques tend to be purely mathematical. The bulk of my time is spent reading papers, learning various areas of mathematics, and trying to apply those theoretical techniques to new frontiers or old sore spots in the field.

I'm putting emphasis on the lack of code in my day-to-day to underscore that quantum algorithms and quantum information theory are definitely in the realm of theoretical computer science. So, make sure you love your theory classes! Of course, my experience is my own, and things may vary at other institutions or in different subareas of the field.

8405,"As I understand it, quantum computing is inherently reversible because quantum mechanics are inherently reversible. As, say, a Hamiltonian evolves, we can think of progressing from state to state across time; but, wherever it ends up, we should be able to figure out how it got there.

So, quantum computers need to ensure reversibility. We typically think of quantum operators as unitary transformations, which are invertible. However, not all functions are inherently invertible. Consider computing a function *f*  such that f*(a,b) = a* \+ *b* (:= *c)*. Moving from the parts to the whole is simple. But, given *c*, it is impossible to determine *a* and *b* with confidence (on a classical computer, that's perfectly acceptable). Any function we want to simulate with a quantum operator must have a one-to-one correspondence between its input and output, unlike *f*.

Fortunately, there are things we can do to ensure a function is bijective. Reconsidering *f* above, define *f'* such that *f'(a,b,c) = (a,b, f(a,b)* XOR *c)* where *a,b,c* are the *n-*bit representations of some positive integers. Now, if given the resulting 3-tuple, it takes no time at all to recover the inputs (note that if *c* was 0, you get back *f(a,b)).* Because this function is bijective, it's a suitable candidate for a quantum operator.

This reason is why you often see a ""target qubit"" as input to oracle operators in many quantum algorithms. That's simply the place you put the output of the hidden oracle function.",1579982005,QuantumComputing,TWalen,Quantum,Comment,245

Treating the sequence \[x mod N,...\] as the discrete samples prior to QFT, OK, I can see that.  And the QFT will reveal higher amplitudes for fundamental periods in the sequence, OK.  But why is he talking about superposition and what role does quantum superposition play in this?  

In other words, the difference between doing this with classical computing and quantum appears to be the superposition, because I can also run a (classical) DFT on the sequence...so why does superposition help?  Thanks in advance.",1579789893,QuantumComputing,mbergman42,Quantum,Comment,189

For actually solving NP-complete problems, the evidence is that quantum computers don't offer more than a quadratic speedup (due to Grover's algorithm) so the problem is still exponentially hard.

What Toshiba is saying is just: we invented an algorithm that, if run on the classical machine, it will be more performing (for certain optimization problems with a high number of variables) better than an ACTUAL quantum computer.

This is important to solve a fundamental problem of actual quantum computer technology: commercialization. Actually there are few quantum computers on the market, and very faulty/not feasible.

Current efforts into quantum proc gen seek to do as much as we can with what we have. This means starting out with things that can be done on a normal computer, and using QC just because you can.

8554,"&gt;Since a qubit has 4 states

qu***bit***. A bit has two states. A quantum bit is a two-dimensional complex vector in Hilbert space.

So there's a whole spectrum of superposition values - not just four. In the end when measuring a qubit, it has only two though; |0&gt; and |1&gt;, because it collapses to those values probabilistically.

Fundamentally though, the whole concept of the above is assuming that one could represent the whole planet as a classical system, which ofc it is not actually. Nor is the whole universe.

8568,"IBM is reviving their spin qubit work in their Swiss labs. And Intel is in deep, having started their operations by collaborating with TU Delft and now in addition to that setting up their own lab full of dilution refrigerators in the US. And like I mentioned earlier, several large semiconductor research foundries have collaborations with universities across the world.

So my response would be that basically all quantum computing platforms are still in their infancy. In spin qubits we have ~10 dot devices, which isn't all that far behind superconducting qubits or ions where they have ~50 when you realize we'll need hundreds to be useful and thousands or more for applucations like shors algorithm.

8572,"Holes in gate-defined quantum dots in germanium are a brand new type of spin qubit.

Spins in semiconductors are one of the first proposed systems to implement qubits in ([Loss and DiVincenzo 1998](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.57.120), [Kane 1998](https://www.nature.com/articles/30156)). The idea is to use the spin (a quantum property) of an electron or nucleus to encode quantum information. If you use electrons they are either bound to an atom or sit in a potential well formed in a 2-dimensional electron gas (a gate-defined quantum dot).

The natural way to control these spins is with an oscillating magnetic field, which is the basis of how MRIs work. For spins in quantum dots though, and more recently with donors, there has been a large push to control the spins electrically instead because it requires less power and the fields can be more confined.

Throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, most of the work on semiconductor spin qubits was done in GaAs. This material is great to form quantum dots for a number of reasons. First, the 2 dimensional electron gas is well below the surface of the crystal, and so its not as sensitive to nanoscale defects at the surface. Second, electrons in GaAs has a small effective mass, which means that the quantum dots are big and therefore relatively easy to make. The big problem with GaAs is that both Ga and As have nuclear spins that the spin of the electron interacts with, which reduces the electron's coherence and makes it difficult to engineer robust qubits from.

Throughout the 2010s there has been a big push to engineer qubits in Si. There are a number of materials you can do this with, like Si MOS, Si/SiGe heterstructures, Si nanowires, etc. There are two big advantages to working with Si as opposed to GaAs. Like you alluded to above, Si is a **very** established material platform, and so researchers in this area have long touted it's potential for scaleup by utilising the power of the semicondcutor industry. Over the last few years several foundries have started working with universities and companies like Intel on this front, but the verdict is still out as to whether or not it is actually scalable. Second, natural Si is ~95% nuclear spin free, and you can actually enrich it to have &lt;100 ppm spin-active nuclei. This means qubits defined in Si have great coherence properties.

This work in gate-defined Ge spin qubits started a few years ago, and to the best of my knowledge the first significant work published on it [was this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05299-x). The paper this thread is about is the important follow-up, where they show the ability to execute single and two qubit gates with high fidelity. Like Si, Ge can also be isotopically enriched so that qubits will have good coherence. Like GaAs, the electron's effective mass in Ge is also small, and so you can fabricate quantum dots much easier than in Si.

TLDR: this work fits in a very well established field dating back two decades to the origins of experimental efforts towards quantum computing using spins in semiconductors. It is very signficant because it establishes a **new** platform for this type of spin qubit that marries the advantages of other platforms that precede it. Another thing that makes it significant is the relatively short period of time for them to demonstrate single- and two-qubit gates from when they first showed quantum dots (they also have presented on devices with 3 qubits in 4 dots, but I don't think its published yet), which shows that things are moving fast on this platform and it has good promise.",1579311992,QuantumComputing,Hypsochromic,Quantum,Comment,603

8577,"Or you could just one of many review articles that explain in great detail now one designs qubits and control hamiltonians in superconducting chips. At the end of the day, you have a hamiltonian that says if you wiggle some variable to you can drive rotations based on a matrix element connecting two states. There are a few ways to do this (e.g. resonant driving, Larmor precession). so, you have to put a wire down that allows you to do that on chip and connect it to some fridge cable (typically 50 Ohm coaxial cables) that has the bandwidth to do the control wiggle you need. The wiggles are either voltage of current (flux). 

I suspect any of these are as good or better than any video course online. But I don't have time, nor inclination to compare. I learned by reading and discussing with coworkers in the field.

So there is no way to make a set-it-and-forget-it program implementing one of these algorithms?

8626,"The application of the algorithms is to just demonstrate that certain tasks can be done with less queries to an oracle than a classical computer. The oracle itself is sort of treated as just a black box that gives some sort of information related to the problem. In these cases how and why it works isn't really of concern as much as it's saying:

&gt;""if a classical computer and a Quantum computer had access to the same information/operation (the oracle), there are quantum-specific actions (in most of these cases it's interference) that lead to it accomplishing the same task with fewer queries to that information""

But what you say is true, in order to *implement* the oracle you do already need knowledge of the answer, even in Qiskit when they implement these that's the case. Which *is* circular, but it's not so much about solving the problem as much as it is about demonstrating capability, and in the case for Qiskit/etc. it's about verifying these algorithms on actual hardware.

You need to keep in mind that most of these were some of the very first algorithms for Quantum Computers so even if it was very basic it showed **a** task where, using interference and superposition, Quantum Computers could outperform classical computers. It gave more motivation to keep researching what was possible with a Quantum Computer.

One of the biggest cons (although a bit 'external' but still very valid) is how difficult it is to actually create a controllable quantum computer in practice, needing control over each individual qubit but also taking into account how gate noise puts a limit on how complex/deep your circuits can be. I don't know the exact numbers off hand but after a certain number of gates on an actual QC now it just devolves into pure random noise which is obviously not very helpful.

For more problems 'inherent' to QC one of them comes from a postulate of Quantum Information which is the [no-cloning theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem). Which essentially means an operation we take for granted (copying and saving information) is literally impossible. That means that a replacement of copying is you need to actually perform the routine over to produce the data you want to perform operations on. Couple that with the problems in the linked paper and that can almost entirely wipe away any exponential advantage you get if the routine isn't efficient.

8709,"It depends what you mean by ""computational powers"".  Alonzo Church in 1934 and Alan Turing in 1936 independently came up with notions of ""computation"" in order to solve a problem posed by David Hilbert: is there a program that will tell you how to solve any mathematical question?  Both of them famously came up with the answer, ""no"", which is very interesting, but out of scope for your question.

Church's approach, lambda calculus, was basically a high-level programming language with first-class functions and such.  Turing's approach was a very simple machine: a tape with cells on it that store bits and a read/write head that can move around and change state.  On the face of it, there's no reason why these two approaches should be the same, but Turing showed they can both emulate each other and both compute the same set of functions.  He proposed the Church-Turing hypothesis: anything that's computable can be computed on a Turing machine.  Since Turing's ideas were much closer to actual hardware, his approach dominated from the 1940s to the late 1960s when computers began to be powerful enough to run compilers.  Once people started writing high-level languages, they gradually rediscovered Church's ideas, and modern functional programming is just lambda calculus with some extra syntax to make things nicer to work with.

From this point of view, the question is, ""Can a quantum computer compute anything that a Turing machine can't?""  As far as we know, the answer is ""yes"", but the only extra thing it can do is produce random bits.  This is useful for turning probabilistic proofs into deterministic ones, but not much else.  So in that respect the computational power of a quantum computer is only ever so slightly better.

A different question is, ""Can a quantum computer compute something faster than a classical computer?""  The answer to this, and the reason QC is interesting, is ""OMG so much faster"".  But that has more to do with the ways that qubits *interact* than how much information they can store.

In a classical computer, we often think of 0 and 1 as opposites, 180 degrees apart.  Up/down, left/right, on/off, true/false, etc.  But in a quantum computer, 0 and 1 are at right angles to each other, more like north and *east* than north and south.  Extending that analogy, south is *negative* north and west is *negative* east.  So a qubit can encode any direction on the compass, like ""southeast"" or ""north by northwest"" or ""a heading of 243 degrees"".

Now imagine you want to remove a tree stump.  You chain two trucks to the stump.  One pulls northwest and the other pulls northeast.  The stump itself will be pulled due north.  The east and west part of the truck's directions cancel each other out; this is called ""destructive interference"".  The two north parts reinforce each other; this is called ""constructive interference"".  Quantum algorithms are designed to make all the wrong answers cancel out with destructive interference and make the right answer get reinforced with constructive interference.

But the real magic happens because of ""Hilbert spaces"".  A qubit has a two dimensional Hilbert space, since you need both a ""±north"" part and a ""±east"" part to describe the state of a qubit.  But if you have multiple qubits, the numbers of dimensions get *multiplied*, not added.  If you have ten qubits, then the state is 2¹⁰ = 1024-dimensional.  It is a list of 1024 complex numbers a₁, a₂, …, a₁₀₂₄ such that |a₁|² + |a₂|² + ⋯ + |a₁₀₂₄|² = 1.  If you do something based on the state of one qubit to the other nine qubits, you'll be affecting 512 different complex numbers at once!

This ability to control half of the amplitudes by manipulating just one qubit, combined with the ability to do destructive interference, is what makes quantum computers so much faster for certain problems.",1578524408,QuantumComputing,theodysseytheodicy,Quantum,Comment,645

8727,"Classical information theory is pretty straightforward: given n base-b digits, there are b^n possible states.  If you want to describe a system with m states and every state is equally likely, you need log_b(m) digits.

But even before getting to quantum information theory, I think your question could be phrased in terms of real numbers: how much information is there in pi?  Assuming pi is normal (which everyone does), every finite string of digits occurs infinitely often.  Does that mean that pi has infinite information?

Or what about the Champernowne constant? 0.123456789101112131415161718192021222324...  This clearly contains every finite string of base-10 digits, and it's also easy to compute where at least one occurrence of the string appears in the number.

A real number contains infinite ""Shannon entropy"", because the way you describe a real number when computing its Shannon entropy is by listing its digits, and there are infinitely many of them.

However, a more useful notion of information for a number is its ""algorithmic entropy"", which talks about the length of the shortest program to compute the number.  There are very short programs that compute pi to arbitrary accuracy, so there's no much information there.  Most numbers you'll run into in math problems, like pi, e, √2, log_2 5, etc. have very small algorithmic entropy.

On the other hand, there are only countably many programs (since a program has a finite length, we can interpret it as a binary number, so there are at most the same number of programs as natural numbers) but uncountably many reals.  So most real numbers are uncomputable.

Now to quantum information.  You might argue that an arbitrary quantum state a|0&gt; + b|1&gt; has infinite information.  If you have an infinite supply of such states, you can get a better and better approximation of a and b by repeated measurements.  In the Shannon sense, you can store infinite information this way, but it requires infinitely many qubits.  The average information per qubit is finite.

You can also look at the algorithmic entropy of the state.  How much information do you need to describe the machine that produces the infinitely many copies of a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;?  Well, it's the number of bits in the smallest blueprint for the machine, which is a finite number.

There's also something called ""quantum information theory"" which looks at how much information you can get out of a single qubit, on average.  For an unentangled qubit, the maximum is one bit, by [Holevo's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo%27s_theorem).  Allowing entanglement, [superdense coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding) lets you store up to 2 bits, which is the maximum.

Not my point at all. Why do you keep attacking things I never said?

""Complex Hilbert space"" is a term that is so out of OP's realm of understanding (currently) that it may as well have been replaced with made up words. You'd need to explain inner product spaces and completion in metric spaces, and then for those you'd have to explain Cauchy sequences and inner products first, but you also have to explain a metric and on and on.

It's like someone asking ""what's the inverse of 3/4?"" and getting a reply that says ""multiplication by 3/4 is a group automorphism of Q as an additive group that sends 4 to 3, and therefore the inverse automorphism would send 3 to 4"".

In a ternary computer, you have 3 states for a bit (I think it's called ""trit""): 0, 1, and 2, and nothing else. (You can represent them differently, but that's not the point)

In a quantum computer, there are infinitely many. Every state can be written as: a(0)+b(1), where a and b are complex numbers that satisfy a certain condition. Here, when I write (0) and (1), these are just names and not numbers, so you could replace them with (up) and (down) or anything else. The main takeaway is that each qubit can take on infinitely many states, because there are infinitely many complex numbers.

The condition that I mentioned for a and b is that |a|^(2)+|b|^(2)=1.

For example, you can have a = -1/sqrt(2) and b = 1/sqrt(2). You could have a = i and b = 0. You could have a = -1/2 and b = i\*sqrt(3)/2. And infinitely many other examples.",1578475341,QuantumComputing,Sarcon5673,Quantum,Comment,166

One way to get a sense for what industry is currently looking for is to look at the jobs pages for the current quantum startups.

Quantum computers that use the spin of the electron are called spin-based quantum computers, or quantum dots. Classical computation using spin just uses the fact that it is a bit, but quantum computers use the fact that it is a qubit.

8774,"That's what makes this grad student's work exciting. From the original article:

""In 2016, for instance, researchers developed a quantum algorithm that could draw inferences from large data sets. It is known as a type of recommendation algorithm because of its similarity to the ‘you-might-also-like’ algorithms used online. Theoretical analysis suggested that this scheme was exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. But in July last year, computer scientist Ewin Tang, then an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, formulated a classical algorithm that worked even faster.""

8775,"When 1Qbit first started, they were writing software exclusively for the DWave device. Then Fujitsu came out with their device, and 1Qbit started writing software for their device too. 

I believe Fujitsu was the first to use the term quantum inspired and that they refer to their device as a quantum inspired quantum annealer, but they are the first to admit that their device is purely classical in the sense that there is no quantum entanglement (quantum coherence) between the qubits. 

As far as I can see from the 1Qbit website, the only gate model qc work they have ever done is some very basic simulations of VQE quantum chemistry, basically just a copy of what IBM and Rigetti have done before them. 

So whenever I hear Microsoft and 1Qbit crowing about doing quantum inspired algorithms for cancer detection and for ameliorating traffic congestion in Seattle, I think they are referring to  an algo that they run on the Fujitsu device.

8855,"It may be a little too early to tell. Restricted Boltzmann machines can be trained to learn probability distributions, and rely on sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, a task for which quantum computers are believed to have an advantage. Google ""quantum boltzmann machines""; there may be some worked examples. Or there may be some machine learning task which relies on some other distribution that quantum computers turn out to be better at sampling.

Some optimizations are performed by expressing the solution to a problem as the minimal energy state of some Hamiltonian and computing that state. These could potentially be computed (approximately) using quantum annealing, or by a quantum-circuit-based Hamiltonian simulation method such as a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) or quantum phase estimation (QPE). These themselves could be considered quantum machine learning methods, so if you're comfortable with that you could list finding ground state energies of small molecules as an exact problem.

One note about quantum annealing: a general quantum annealer is as powerful as a quantum-circuit based computer, but nobody has actually built one. DWAVE's machine can handle a restricted class of quantum annealing problems, and nobody is sure how restricted that class actually is, or whether quantum can really give an advantage for it. If you need a specific example here, DWAVE's site should have some papers involving solving Ising models and similar such things.

Many machine learning methods are based on linear algebra. In the last ten years quantum methods for linear algebra based on linear combinations of unitaries and quantum walks have been developed, which seem likely to have application. Computing the circuit cost for a specific problem in these cases is obscure to non-experts; the complexity of the computation depends on specific details of the matrix you care about and requires expertise to compute. As there aren't yet quantum computers that are capable of doing anything useful (relative to a classical computer), you may not find a lot of specific worked, published examples here.",1577787625,QuantumComputing,reluctantdinosaur,Quantum,Comment,330
8856,"A qubit is a unit of quantum information, just as a bit is a unit of classical information. It is, in particular, the smallest such unit, just like the bit is for classical information. A qubit corresponds naturally to any quantum mechanical system in which a measurement can give at most two possible outcomes (mathematically, a two-dimensional Hilbert space). Atoms, subatomic particles, and other such things are hardware implementations for quantum information storage and manipulation, just as optical or magnetic media and transister circuits are for classical information.

For hardware based on more-than-two-outcome quantum states, the terms ""qutrit"" (for three-outcome systems) and ""qudit"" (for some arbitrary but fixed number of outcomes) are sometimes used; for some purposes it is natural to quantify information in this way. These notions are convertible to and from qubits.

If you buy error-corrected memory, the advertised capacity is the number of logical bits, that is, the number that are available to the user for use in a computation. Additional physical bits are present in the hardware to perform error correction. If quantum computing weren't in such an embryonic state that quantum error correction of even a single qubit is a significant engineering challenge, most users would presumably be exposed to the convention of specifying logical qubits only, just as is the case in classical computing.

Generally, the more stable a qubit hardware implementation is for long-term storage the more difficult it is to manipulate it quickly, so just has been the case for classical computing we may expect to see different hardware implementations for computation, transport, and storage of qubits.",1577785094,QuantumComputing,reluctantdinosaur,Quantum,Comment,265

* Right now: There are no ML problems that can be solved more efficiently with QC because of technical limitations. But theoretically we know of a few problem types that could be solved.
* Later: If we clear some technical limitations there might be some problems that QC can solve faster. But that's assuming we haven't figured out faster ways with classical computing by then (and we haven't theoretically proven that we can't)
* Future: The author takes a ""we don't know what we don't know"" kind of attitude. We haven't disproven anything, so maybe QC can play a greater role than we anticipate right now.",1577783197,QuantumComputing,_4lexander_,Quantum,Comment,148

8874,"Perhaps it's a bit too late for my answer, but I'll try to throw in my take on it: 

A sphere is defined by three variables. Taking polar coordinates, these are the radius of the vector, the polar and the azimuthal angles. Each of these has a direct physical origin when talking about a qubit state. The Bloch sphere is very vanilla, meaning it is defined as a unit vector sphere. Ok, so points can be only on the surface - why the hell is it called a sphere then? Physically, this radius equal to 1 corresponds to the general idea of conservation of whatever you used to encode the qubit. Now, experimentalists might often lose some energy, because of some evil nasty ""environment"" aka the rest of their device. You might also see this in the literature as ""the shit"", or formally the notion of pure vs mixed states. Radius down, two angles left. The polar one is the associated with the excitation of the qubit, defined by the way you have set up your ""0"" and ""1"". The final one is the relative phase of the 1, relative to the 0 since people don't care about global phases. Now, both of these are continuous variables, so you can have infinitely many possible states that your qubit can be in. So you have a sum of 0 and 1, with possible some complex thing in there, a superposition if you want to be fancy. The coefficients in this linear combination have to normalized, which is the conservation law again, placing the vector on the surface of the sphere. That means that when you want a 0 + 1 you also normally add a 1/sqrt(2) before each, such that when squared the sum is 1. If it is not, some annoying people might come up to you and complain about ""unphysical states"", but if you don't limit yourself with such concerns, you can easily go beyond.  

Now you might wonder what physical things these variables correspond to. For a textbook thing like a spin qubit, the radius is 1 because spin is a fundamental property, the excitation is how up or down the spin points (the z components), and the phase describe the rotation of the spin when it's not fully aligned with a magnetic field, the larmor precession.",1577740897,QuantumComputing,quantum-engineer,Quantum,Comment,389

A qubit is a vector in a 2 dimensional complex Hilbert space. If you don't know what that means, ignore it forthetine being. 

Here's the real low-level explanation. It's a mathematical construct. Another example of such a thing is numbers. Let's say you have a bag with apples in it. Let's say the number of apples in your bag is five. You don't need physicists or even philosophers to explain to you what that's means. You've got five apples in your bag. The number five certainly isn't defined by the number of apples in your bag.   It's just a number and the number of apples in your bag happens to be a representation of that number.

For example take an electron (just one!): as it is a fermion it is a spin 1\2 particle and its Spin only takes two possible values and you can prepare and manipulate it. When you couple two or more isolated electrons you have a two qubit state system capable of entanglement where you can do some quantum computation.

8894,"Spin isn’t directly related to magnetism. It’s hard to explain anything at all about spin until you learn some graduate level group theory, but I’ll try anyway.

When we talk about particles in quantum physics, we’re really talking about a bundle of mathematical variables. The simplest ones are the ones used to describe position (where is it) and momentum (how much is it moving). There are other quantities like electric charge that, unlike position and momentum, describe how the particle interacts with other particles. Position and momentum are kind of special because they are needed to describe any physical object whatsoever. 

Spin is more like position or momentum than like charge. Spin is part of the description of any quantum particle, not just those that interact with he electromagnetic field. To get a feel for why this is true, there is a very common analogy to belts.

Imagine holding a belt, one end in one hand and one end in another. Then pull the ends of the belt apart until the belt is taught. Generally, the belt will be twisted, and you can count the number of half-turns in the belt to classify the amount of twisting that the belt has. If you want to do (or undo) exactly one half-turn of the belt, you have to let go with one of your hands, but you can do or undo two half-turns at s time (one whole turn) without letting go of either hand.

That is to say, the twistiness of the belt is not really the number of half-turns but the parity of the number of half-turns. The only truly physical information is whether there are an even or odd number of half-turns; the other half-turns are an accident of how you chose to move your hands around after you grasped either end of the belt.

Spin is kind of like the twistiness of the belt. I guess you could call it the twistiness of the particle. Spin up vs spin down are two distinct was you could have observed a spin-half particle like an electron. In the particular case of an electron, the spin is associated with a small magnetic dipole but need not be for other particles.

Not to be confused with the measure problem.The measurement problem in quantum mechanics is the problem of how (or whether) wave function collapse occurs.

The wave function in quantum mechanics evolves deterministically according to the Schrödinger equation as a linear superposition of different states. However, actual measurements always find the physical system in a definite state.

8903,"It depends on which parameters you're referring to. \phi and \theta represent the polar and azimuthal angles of the line relative to the sphere in spherical coordinates. (u,v,w) are the Cartesian coordinates on the sphere.

Also, you might already know this, but a somewhat analagous mathematical example is the classical position vector. For example, in Cartesian coordinates, you could have a particle located at (2,4,1), which would be represented by 2i + 3j + 1k. Likewise, a quantum state at (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) that would be represented as (1/sqrt(2)|0&gt; + (1/sqrt(2))|1&gt;.

The main purpose of the Bloch sphere representation is to better visualize the coefficients of these basis vectors and the parameters describe how the coefficients map to the sphere. Also, the two poles represent each vector, |0&gt; and |1&gt; and the one with an arrow closer to it has the higher probability of being collapsed to when the qubit is measured.

8909,"**Quantum state**

In quantum physics, a quantum state is the state of an isolated quantum system. A quantum state provides a probability distribution for the value of each observable, i.e. for the outcome of each possible measurement on the system. Knowledge of the quantum state together with the rules for the system's evolution in time exhausts all that can be predicted about the system's behavior.A mixture of quantum states is again a quantum state.

You might benefit from some more concrete linear algebra courses if that's too much for you (I think there are several online), it's more proof-based than you may have been exposed to at your age (though US schools are much worse in maths than yours may have been).

I'm also working through Mermin's Intro to Quantum Computer Science, which is really interesting but could definitely use some more exposition. It glosses over a lot of notation (for instance, the way to calculate Kronecker matrix products was either missing or confined to an appendix). Things that take me a page or two of calculation to prove are treated as obvious (because they probably are, if you have the linear algebra).

8943,"**Quantum teleportation**

Quantum teleportation is a process in which quantum information (e.g. the exact state of an atom or photon) can be transmitted (exactly, in principle)  from one location to another, with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and receiving location. Because it depends on classical communication, which can proceed no faster than the speed of light, it cannot be used for faster-than-light transport or communication of classical bits. While it has proven possible to teleport one or more qubits of information between two (entangled) quanta, this has not yet been achieved between anything larger than molecules.Although the name is inspired by the teleportation commonly used in fiction, quantum teleportation is limited to the transfer of information rather than matter itself.

8963,"&gt; I was considering switching to MS Physics. 

I assume you already looked into this? MS in physics is very rare/non-existent in the US as it doesn't really unlock any jobs by itself and seen as a concession for those who dropped out of a PhD physics program. And PhD physics programs generally expect you to have taken an equivalent coursework as a Bachelor's degree in physics (classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum, stat mech, etc.).

&gt;The bio route, on the other hand, seems to be potentially more promising. I'm interested in the genetic engineering of bacteria to serve an application in circular economies, and the research is close enough to that. The advisor is new and coming from Texas A&amp;M. She is very focused on this topic and I can pivot to similar projects with other advisors if need be.

​I'm not in the industry, but I have friends who are and it seems that biotech is already a thriving industry with tons of startups and established companies. If your goal is to go into a startup, biotech would have much more opportunities than QC. As the_shape89 mentioned, QC is much more nascent with mostly academic positions. There are a few industry positions, but even these mostly research for now. It's hard to say when the QC industry will actually take off.

&gt; Is this project as uncertain as I'm making it out to be? 

I would trust the advisor if they have experience advising MS theses, since it is their job to lay out a good project.

&gt; Would it be of any value in finding meaningful employment? 

Biotech is going to be much better than QC for employment. That said, if you are willing to go into tangential fields (semiconductors, materials, etc.) than that would open up many more opportunities after a QC PhD.

&gt; Perhaps the advisor's main focus is QC but only now has gotten around to it?

It would be easier to judge based on his profile, but based on your description it sounds like he already works on topics related to quantum computing? Maybe not directly in doing quantum algorithms, but cryogenics and material properties is huge in QC to develop better qubits.

&gt; Also, how likely is it that I'll have a meaningful thesis and paper running solely on simulations?

Unlikely. And not because of the simulation part, but just because a lot of MS these are not super meaningful. The whole point is to get you familiar with research, not necessarily churn out high-impact papers.",1577380467,QuantumComputing,SamStringTheory,Quantum,Comment,422

8984,"I'd say control circuit design is much more important than emulation. Much of the modern hardware *needs* the kind of fast, problem-specific calculations that only FPGAs or dedicated circuits can provide. Also, given that FPGAs are often used to prototype things, you could simultaneously be designing control/error correction circuitry that ends up on a chip with the qubits themselves, which is probably the long-term design path for good quantum hardware anyways lol.

I did a bit of qubit emulation with my Zedboard a few years back and it was interesting, but ultimately felt kinda gimmicky; after all, they're not really going to be better than actual QCs anyways.

8987,"I'll give it a shot but I'm a novice myself. Take whatever I say with a grain of salt... or a full shaker.

We start with: (a + ib) |0&gt; + (c + id) |1&gt;

Since a bloch sphere is the difference in imaginary phase: a |0&gt; + (c + i(d - b)) |1&gt;

To convert to polar, the magnitude of ""a"" needs to be converted:  θ = 2 arccos(a)

C and d are already describing phase, so no polar conversion needed: φ = d - b

\[See wikipedia for definitions of θ and φ\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch\_sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere))

The bloch sphere vector is: &lt;sin(θ) cos(φ), sin(θ) sin(φ),  cos(θ)&gt;

Plugging in we get: sin(2 arccos(a)) cos(d - b), sin(2 arccos(a)) sin(d - b),  cos(2 arccos(a))

Half-angle formulas: 2 sin(arccos(a)) cos(arccos(a)) cos(d - b), 2 sin(arccos(a)) cos(arccos(a)) sin(d - b),  2 cos(arccos(a)) sin(arccos(a))

Since this is a unit sphere, we knowa\^2 + c\^2 = 1. That means:  arccos(a) = arcsin(c)

So:  2 sin(arcsin(c)) cos(arccos(a)) cos(d - b), 2 sin(arcsin(c)) cos(arccos(a)) sin(d - b),  2 cos(arccos(a)) sin(arcsin(c))

8988,"I work on superconducting qubits, so I'm somewhat biased. But my understanding is that people in most of the hardware disciplines are working very hard on using silicon-based technologies to scale up. I've seen people very optimistically discuss scaling of this sort for, at least, superconducting, semiconducting, trapped ion, and now photonic qubits. A quick glance at the paper from the article suggests that the on-chip size of their photon sources is in the 10-micron regime, which is actually fairly similar to most of the silicon-based qubits I've seen. So I'd say they're probably on par with the superconducting community in terms of potential scalability but behind in terms of some of the development of the tech, though I know almost nothing about photonics so this is all very speculative.

Lincoln Lab is doing very cool stuff with scaling. The TSV tech you mentioned is great, and they have quite a few other efforts on scaling and engineering going on that are pretty interesting.

In quantum mechanics, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.Quantum mechanics is mathematically formulated in Hilbert space or projective Hilbert space.

The space of pure states of a quantum system is given by the one-dimensional subspaces of the corresponding Hilbert space (or the ""points"" of the projective Hilbert space).

For a two-dimensional Hilbert space, this is simply the complex projective line  ℂℙ1. This is the Bloch sphere.

In classical computation, code is usually written in a high level language (such as C++), which, for the most part, does not mention bits. Then a compiler of some sort reduces the high level language to bit level instructions.

Quantum Fog is a tool for writing QC programs in a high level visual language, and then simulating the resulting programs. Quantum Fog can also feed this high level language to Qubiter. (The high level language uses decision diagrams called quantum Bayesian networks, which are discussed elsewhere in this website). Qubiter is a tool that translates this high level language to qubit level instructions which can then be fed to a QC. Hence we call Quantum Fog a quantum computer simulator and Qubiter a quantum compiler.

In some sense the quantum computer can *consider* all the possible inputs in its calculation, but it can't output the individual results for all of them. Instead, though, it can divine certain overall properties about how inputs and outputs relate given your program.  


So for example there is a quantum algorithm that can determine whether a function is constant without manually checking every input and output.

I haven't spent any significant time on the quantum cloud platforms, so I don't know what you have direct access to at the moment, but I am as certain as can be that Google's Sycamore processor has one-to-four connectivity, or whatever you want to call it. You can read for yourself on the [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/quantum-supremacy-using-programmable.html) about supremacy, or in the paper, or in the video of the talk he gave at Caltech shortly after the announcement. There's a figure in each that shows the architecture very clearly. I'd be surprised if IBM's 53-qubit computer is not similar. Not only is this connectivity in plain sight, but Martinis himself has said in public that Google is doing some preliminary work related to surface code error correction on their existing hardware. Also, at the physical qubit level, I think IBM and Google both have all-to-all connectivity via swap gates, but I'm not sure if this is relevant for error correction algorithms.
2. I think we're falling victim to the constantly-changing terminology of a young field. The academic literature sometimes uses ""decoherence"" to mean any single-qubit errors at all, and sometimes uses it to refer to dephasing errors. In whatever you're working with, the term seems to also include energy relaxation, as it's apparently referring to the time limit imposed by the finite coherence times of the qubits. ""Fidelity"", in the literature, usually refers to the likelihood of running a gate without error. Honestly it's a bit annoying that we haven't arrived at more consistent terminology as a community, but I suppose that's inevitable at this stage. (Hell, we're still arguing over [""supremacy""](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/classical) and ""advantage"".)
3. ""No practical value"" is a given for today's quantum computing platforms, except perhaps for Scott Aaronson's randomness certification algorithm, maybe some quantum simulation experiments, and other very early-stage research work.

So 4 qubits are involved, yes, but these algorithms (the ones I've encountered, anyway) require 1 qubit to be connected to 4 other qubits, so 5 qubits must be involved.

2. The terms are used differently in practice. In practice, ""decoherence"" is generally a result of circuit length (time) and ""errors"" is about fidelity at any circuit length. So you can either shorten your circuit and do nothing algorithmically about whatever errors arise, or you can add code to mitigate errors and make the circuit so long that it doesn't matter anyway.

9206,"&gt;how the Qbits are measured and monitored. 

Well that depends on the hardware and I too am not fully aware on how it is done, so here is a generic answer: In quantum mechanics you have observables (things you can measure), that might be how an ion interacts with a magnetic field (spin, angular momentum), magnetic or electric resistance (superconductivity), ... 
This you can use to determine the state of a quantum system (while collapsing it to the one state you measured), you could look up the Stern Gerlach Experiment for instance, it gives a good overview to how measurement works in QM. 
Measurements in qbits will be way harder (as you cannot shoot your qbits through a magnetic field).

&gt;How do the gates function to allow the interaction with EM radiation and how do we measure that interaction?

So basically a gate is just a name for ""we interact with the system"". Typically qbits can interact with electromagnetic radiation, as charged particles are involved (mostly electrons). A qbit has two levels, so it can go from the ground state to the excited state by absorbing a photon and so forth. How some other gates work might be more difficult, but this is the idea of how it works.

We do not measure the interaction, we can only measure the observables.",1576216363,QuantumComputing,LittleByBlue,Quantum,Comment,221

Basically, how a quantum computer works is that the program does some prep work to set everything up in a quantum way (it's pretty much the same preperation for every program), which classical computers can't do, then it runs a plain old, run of the mill algorithm. Often this algorithm is no different than what you would run on a classical computer. But by running this algorithm on qubits instead of bits, all of your states can remain ""undecided"" until the end of your program. In a classical computer, you have to run your algorithm exactly once for every possible set of input values (2^n where n is the number of bits in your input). But in a quantum computer, a single ""undecided"" input will do the trick. (Quantum physics allows the initial state of the system to be decided retroactively, after the program has already run. This ensures that you are always working with the single input value that gives you the right output value, instead of trying them one by one). Finally, the program does some more quantum stuff to ensure that the ""undecided"" state actually collapses into the correct position.

All of this is to say, the quantum stuff is usually pretty standard.

Well yes. We don't have the hardware yet. But why is that a problem? The hardware has some technical difficulties that will most probably be solved. In the mean time we can focus on developing new algorithms. 

Also: there was research on how to use classical computers way before they worked. And researchers claimed that they could solve stuff way before the first computer worked.

&gt;Can quantum computers break RSA encryption

Yes they can. But currently the errors might be too big and we can break like 7bit RSA instead of 2048bit.

&gt;In many cases, no circuits are involved at all, and the progress is all theoretical and mathematics. 

That is like saying to a software engineer ""hey but all you did was design an application and code it, there is no bytecode involved"". Quantum computing is mostly mathematics. And most of it is extremely theoretical. And once the theory is there you can write down the circuit trivially.

From the other stuff you wrote (I have read a lot of it) it sounds like you should take a course in QC at a university. (And before that maybe linear algebra 1&amp;2 and quantum mechanics 1.) I don't want to beat you down or anything but you just seem to lack the basic understanding of how QC works. And I think just reading some papers won't do the trick.

I think how Amazon Braket ultimately affects qc users and other qc companies will very much depend on who it affects, and on the quality and properties of the cloud service that Amazon ultimately ends up providing.

 For example, if  Amazon ends up providing a really good service for doing hybrid quantum-classical AI, there might be little incentive for users to visit the house cloud of a companies like Xanadu or Rahlko.

 For a company like Rigetti, I don't think Amazon Braket will have much of an effect. I doubt it will generate new clients for them. At most, it will cause some of the clients that would have used their hardware anyway to access it in a different way.

9372,"Just with any kind of math. Practice and exposure.  

The state is already conveniently bracketed for us, so we can work with that.  
Otherwise you would do that first.  

If we write out the full desired state you get  
|001&gt; -|010&gt; + |100&gt; + |111&gt;  
I'll leave out normalization for convenience.  
Also keep in mind that |000&gt; is a common short hand writing of |0&gt;|0&gt;|0&gt;  
Or more general |000&gt; = |000&gt;\_(abc) = |0&gt;\_a|0&gt;\_b|0&gt;\_c = |0&gt;\_a⊗|0&gt;\_b⊗|0&gt;\_c  

Look at the state and see if you can separate it  
Just like how x\*y + x\*z = x\*(y+z)  
If we separate out the first qubit, you get the state in the post.  But you can also separate out the third qubit (or the second, but that makes writing it a bit more annoying)  
So separating out the first qubit you get, indeed |0&gt;(|01&gt; - |10&gt;) + |1&gt;(|00&gt; + |11&gt;)  
Now |01&gt; - |10&gt; and |00&gt; + |11&gt; can't be separated any further, they are entangled states. They are actually two of the four [Bell states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state),  namely and |Φ^(+)&gt; and |Ψ^(-)&gt;  

So then qubit b and c are  |Ψ^(-)&gt;  if a == |0&gt;  and |Φ^(+)&gt; if a == |1&gt;  

We can use qubit a as a control qubit. We first put it in a superposition by doing a Hadamard (H) gate  
The H gate turns |0&gt; into |0&gt; + |1&gt; and |1&gt; into |0&gt; - |1&gt;
So if we start with a in |0&gt;, and apply a Hadamard to a, then a becomes H|0&gt; = |0&gt; + |1&gt;

We can now use controlled gates with a as control, to turn b and c into their desired Bell states.  
Basically:  
If a = |0&gt; turn b and c into (|01&gt; - |10&gt;), if a = |1&gt; turn b and c into (|00&gt; + |11&gt;)

How we can do that is to first create a circuit for both Bell states to create them. Consider these circuit as one big gate. And apply this big gate only when a is the desired state.  

So first, to create |00&gt; + |11&gt;  
This probably the most commont bell state and the simples to create.  
Starting with |00&gt;_(bc)  
First apply a H on qubit b; H_b|00&gt; = |00&gt; + |10&gt;  
Now we want to turn qubit c into a |1&gt; only if b is a |1&gt;. We can do this with a CNOT gate, a Controlled-X. This gate flips the target qubit (from |0&gt; to |1&gt; and vice versa) only if the control qubit is in |1&gt;  
So  
CNOT|00&gt; = |00&gt;  
CNOT|01&gt; = |01&gt;  
CNOT|10&gt; = |11&gt;  
CNOT|11&gt; = |10&gt;  

Thus applying it to |00&gt; + |10 you get CNOT(|00&gt; + |10&gt;) = CNOT|00&gt; + CNOT|10&gt; = |00&gt; + |11&gt;.  
Or in circuit form:  
https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,%22H%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22]]}

top qubit is c  
second qubit b   
third qubit is a  

Then, for |01&gt; - |10&gt;  
We could start from zero with |00&gt;  
But we already know how to make |00&gt; + |11&gt;, so let's use that  
All we need to is to flip bit b. We can do that with an X gate: X(|00&gt; + |11&gt;) = |10&gt; + |01&gt;  = |01&gt; + |10&gt;  
And then flip the sign of |10&gt;  
We can do that with a Z gate, (also known as a phase gate with a rotation of π) on qubit b    
Z|0&gt; = |0&gt;  
Z|1&gt; = -|1&gt;  
So Z_b(|01&gt; + |10&gt;) = |01&gt; - |10&gt;  

https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,%22H%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22X%22],[1,%22Z%22]]}

So now we want the first circuit if a is |1&gt;, and the second circuit if a is |0&gt;  
So start with a in |0&gt; + |1&gt; (with an Hadamard) and then do turn each gates in our two circuits in a controlled gate with a as control  

[Circuit](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,1,%22H%22],[1,%22H%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22H%22,%22%E2%97%A6%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%97%A6%22],[1,%22X%22,%22%E2%97%A6%22],[1,%22Z%22,%22%E2%97%A6%22]]})

Of if you don't like |0&gt; being the controlled factor:

[Circuit](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,1,%22H%22],[1,%22H%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,1,%22X%22],[1,%22H%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22Z%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,1,%22X%22]]})  
Flip a, apply the controlled gates, flip a back

There done

But there are some optimizations to be made.  

Note that for both circuits we create the state |00&gt; + |11&gt; on b and c. So we don't need to use controlled gates for that, just doing it once is enough  
[Circuit](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,%22H%22,%22H%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,1,%22X%22],[1,%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22Z%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,1,%22X%22]]})

And finally on qubit a, we first apply a Hadamard to turn it into |0&gt; + |1&gt;, then apply an X to flip it, but X(|0&gt; + |1&gt;) = |1&gt; + |0&gt; = |0&gt; + |1&gt;. So that doesn't do anything, so we can remove that X  

[Final Circuit](https://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[1,%22H%22,%22H%22],[%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22X%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,%22Z%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22],[1,1,%22X%22]]})


If you check this is the circuit that /u/mdskrzypczyk designed as well.  

As a practice you can try to design a circuit with c as control instead  
So extracting the third qubit out of |001&gt; -|010&gt; + |100&gt; + |111&gt; results in (|00&gt; + |11&gt;)|1&gt; + (|10&gt;-|01&gt;)|0&gt;

9395,"Oh this ones a cool one and I agree definitely challenging to explain to anyone, I know this from experience.

Well in your shoes I'de first tackle the particle wave duality, since from my experience that's what seems to confuse the shit out of people. Initially maybe dont go too deep into any quantum tunneling or entanglement, just focus on duality and after that go into super position.

I would say something like this:

First thing you have to do is imagine a marble.

Second thing you have to do is imagine the waves or ripples in water after you just dropped something into it.

Now imagine a piece of plastic that has 2 little vertical slices cut into it sorta like a pig's nose right
And imagine a piece of paper that glows whenever it is touched

Now if you take your marble and throw it through one of those slices obviously it will light up the piece of paper directly behind the slice that you through it through

Now imagine that instead of the marble you let one of those ripples go through the slices. On the piece of paper instead of one glowing spot you have many , because as the ripples pass though both slices it dividedes into 2 separate ripples, and these ripples hit each other at some points causing what is called an interference pattern(show a pic of one)

Now a quantum particle is strange because it has properties of both the marble and the ripple in the water. Super weird but true. The difference is that the ripple from a quantum particle is not physical it is what's called a wave of probability.  What that means is that instead of being physically like the ripple in the water you imagined physically, a wave of probability means that you have some chance of finding the quantum particle somewhere in that ripple. 

So if I throw quantum particles at the 2 slices the paper will glow as if I was sending the ripples from the water 

But a quantum particle is also like the marble because if we decided to find the quantum particle in the wave of probability we talked about, you find that the quantum particle is there at one point in space as if it was always just a marble.

How is that useful, well if the quantum particle is a wave than we can say that instead of only being able to be a 1 or a 0 like a light switch on or off, a quantum particle is both a 1 and a 0 and everything in between that at the same time, this is called superposition.

For computers this means that you can store more information with less.

For example to double your data capacity on a regular computer you need to double the number of transistors or switches 

But for quantum computers the quantum bits or particles are like we said 1 0 and everything in between so instead of having to double the number of qbits to double data you get this 

2^qbits 

That number will get very large very quickly, and with all that data we can make simulations of very complicated things like molecules or break very hard cryptography problems in a jiffy",1575470223,QuantumComputing,_balbuena,Quantum,Comment,548

No, not yet.  No quantum network and some laws of physics issues to resolve.

On the network, US Department of Energy is funding new grants on transducers for quantum data.  That is cool, could get us to quantum networking (for entangled sensor networks).  This could support distributed quantum computing.

The workaround is to break up a job into chunks, run the independent chunks on multiple quantum computers, and assemble the answers classically.  Then, can do it again.  We cannot read, copy, store, forward and load entangled data across two quantum computers today.

* CR gate - you send a microwave pulse at frequency f_a through qubit B to qubit A (again likely coupled through a resonator). The state of B impacts the signal that A gets.

There are other implementations too, but these are the most common.",1575298312,QuantumComputing,EngSciGuy,Quantum,Comment,90
9467,"1) My guess would be no (for now), since we are still very much thinking about small numbers of qubits for programs on hardware. That's not to say it's not possible in simulation, because you can probably find a way to spin up two back ends in Qiskit or something and solve two sub-problems and compare / use the results together afterward. Not really sure what sort of application you would want this for, since to communicate over a classical channel you would have to collapse state on both/ all of the machines before you could move information, which kind of defeats the point. 

2) As far as I know (and someone please correct me on this if I am wrong) but we don't really have any quantum channels to talk between quantum computers. While I know there is work on quantum channels for networking, they usually arnt for connecting quantum computing hardware directly. This is because in order to SWAP two qubits between devices, you would have to SWAP info from your computing qubit to some sort of carrier (make a transmon influence a photon or something), fire that carrier over a wire (fiber probably), then swap the carrier into a qubit on device two somewhere, then repeat the process backward to device one. This would be a logistical nightmare for a few reasons, but my guess is our current decoherence times wouldn't really allow us to do that, not to mention the problem of building the encoding/decoding steps. It may be possible for full photonic systems, but that presents a whole different set of issues.",1575297207,QuantumComputing,Dabasser,Quantum,Comment,267

The particular line about cirq being in alpha is *probably* overselling it at this point. Breaking changes are much rarer now, and preceded by deprecations (but there are still exceptions). Part of making quality software is realizing that you won't get it quite right the first time, and setting expectations to allow you to work around that. For example, Rust went through a similar phase where they kept breaking source compatibility during their beta. I think this kind of warning is just being honest about the situation, though it seems to have hit a nerve in this case.

Solving certain types of problems can take billions of years on our current conventional computers. Quantum computers, however, could potentially solve these types of problems in just seconds. Quantum computers have the potential to impact many fields, such as machine learning, medicine, and energy systems. What is possible in the future with quantum computers? How do quantum computers work? How do you program a quantum computer? How much progress have we made?

A trapdoor function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, yet difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding its inverse) without special information, called the ""trapdoor"". Trapdoor functions are widely used in cryptography.

In mathematical terms, if f is a trapdoor function, then there exists some secret information t, such that given f(x) and t, it is easy to compute x. Consider a padlock and its key.

High-frequency phenomena would remain in a probability state unless a resonance structure is developed through technology. Objective time would be only as long as the electromagnetic spectrum, with the high-frequency termination point of the electromagnetic spectrum being the objective present, and subjective time being limited to the extremely low-frequency range our neural oscillations occupy. Technology could also facilitate a necessary procession of the electromagnetic spectrum at some time, with everything being an expression of the same consciousness from different objectively temporal locations. This could even eliminate the need for a big bang, or at least supplement it. And dark matter and energy could be the effect of competing high-frequency probability structures.

9624,"DNA is a nice way to construct complex things (as an instruction set) that, upon replication, produce imperfect copies of said DNA. This enables evolution, which over *very* long timescales, leads to fantastic instruction sets. Yes, the brain is one of those things, but the grand majority of species on this planet (by orders of magnitude!) don't have brains and are wildly successful evolution-wise.

DNA is an instruction set that does provide instructions for producing a great brain, but also remember that it stores a *fuckload* of information. It's not easy to produce that quantity of information - if we were to try to replicate it, we'd need a comparable amount of time to the evolutionary process that created it.

As for what your next question might be: Simulating DNA after scanning an entire human's genome to produce a brain is a far more computationally complex task than basically any other computation performed today. If we were to utilize the entire computational power of every device on the planet - including any future quantum computers - we still wouldn't be able to simulate the sheer number of interatomic force interactions necessary for the chemistry that turns DNA into a brain. Even if we could simulate that starting point, you still need to simulate the growth of an entire human being, and then even after that, you'd have to simulate the interactions of the human body with all of the other species that live in our guts.

...but though...if you're really interested in this kind of thing...read Neal Stephenson's *Fall; or, Dodge in Hell.* It's a fictional exploration of simulating the human brain as a means to an afterlife.

 &gt;I haven't gave a lot of thought to simple explanation that artificial life stops simply because of lack scale and time. How can it even be tested?

Well, I tested it already. Small worlds in Biogenesis just cannot develop the biodiversity of larger worlds. But the same is true in the real world. All species need to have a certain minimal population to not go extinct by chance. And there is geographic isolation, that cannot be simulated, if the simulated environment is just too small.

&gt; Something resembling real life environment? But in this case we can never be sure that the progress stopped from something other than not enough rich environment.

I would favour a simple 2D world, so that organism can interact with each other in space. I think that cellular automata (or not having space at all) are too simple. 

Biogenesis environments are only created by the organisms themselves, living in a rectangular uniform 2D world. Is this enough? No idea. But the world needs to be larger (more organisms are needed). How can we be sure? Enlarge the environment until we cannot increase biodiversity anymore. I don´t think that I have reached this point for my Color Mod.

9669,"&gt;During natural selection information of environment is stored in the structure of the individulal. The more complex the environment the more complex the structure of the adapted individuals.

I am not sure, if organisms strictly need to be more complex, if the environment is more complex. Depends on the niche they live in. In my simulation, the complexity between different organisms, that interact with each other in the same environment can vary greatly.

But your other idea is actually really good. I thought about this too.
 
If we find a fossil of an Ankylosaurus for example, we could indeed say something of its environment. We see, that it is well protected. This means, that there had to be a dangerous large predator in existence during that time. This also tells us something about Tyrannosaurus. For example T rex surely wasn´t a scavenger only (ok, another predator alternatively could exist, which hunts Ankylosaurus...) 

The environment of a giraffe needs to have trees. And it needs to be a competitive environment. There need to be species, that feed on lower shrubs to force the giraffe to occupy a niche, that has higher costs to live in.

The pronghorn is much faster, than it needs to be. And there is, or was a reason for this, the recently extinct american cheetah. 

If we find a small flightless bird, we nearly know for sure, that it comes from an island.

And the same is true for Biogenesis. I could tell people something about the environment of the creature, if they show me it. Might not be perfect of course.

The environment is indeed a bit of a negative image (like in photography) of that organism.

&gt; The Red Queen hypothesis is an evolutionary hypothesis which proposes that organisms must constantly adapt, evolve, and proliferate in order to survive while pitted against ever-evolving opposing organisms in a constantly changing environment, as well as to gain reproductive advantage.

Right, I believe so too, but I am not sure, if this means, that everything necessarily gets more and more complex, even if we do not consider an extinction event like an asteroid impact. 

An example from Biogenesis. If all consumers die out (I don´t really like this and try to balance the simulation, so that this does not happen), which more often happens in smaller worlds, complex defensive structures aren´t needed anymore. Instead the amount of CO2 falls, and all plants start to massively compete for CO2 (it is limited). Organisms that survive here, reduce complexity by removing non-photosynthetic segments. The world becomes less complex (in my opinion), until new predators evolve. Sure, they always have to adapt, but complexity can indeed go down.

Therefore, the ""Red Queen"" can work in your hypothetic simulation, but complexity just oscilattes, or there are just environmental turnovers, that do not generate added complexity.

We do not know btw, if real evolution will always create more complexity. I would at least say, that this will stop to be true, if the environment gets more and more hostile to life (sun that will get hotter in the far future for example, or man made problems maybe).

Ok, higher intelligence at least is something new, that wasn´t realized before on this planet. 

Well, if this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity#/media/File:Phanerozoic_Biodiversity.png is true (correct estimation), real evolution shows no sign of being stuck yet. And sure, existing simulators cannot compete at all. Although you would also need computing power.

I'm a graduated mathematician. So my basic math is enough. A more specialized math first needs to be found relevant. As about physics I considered getting the essense of quantum computer mechanics as it can be useful in this task (I'd rather bet that it should not be relevant but who knows...). My best idea is to start from this lecture https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html by Scott Aaronson:

&gt; Quantum mechanics is what you would inevitably come up with if you started from probability theory, and then said, let's try to generalize it so that the numbers we used to call ""probabilities"" can be negative numbers. As such, the theory could have been invented by mathematicians in the 19th century without any input from experiment. It wasn't, but it could have been.

9675,"**Code as data**

In computer science, the expressions code as data and data as code refer to the duality between code and data, that allows computers to treat instructions in a programming language as data handled by a running program.

Concepts where computer code is treated as data, or data executed as code, include:



Configuration scripts, declarative programming, domain-specific languages and markup languages, where program execution is controlled by data elements that are not sequences of commands.

First-class functions, functions that can be accessed as entities in the language.

Homoiconicity, a property of languages like LISP where the code has the same structure as the data.

It is quite simple: create a mathematical model. Then study that model. This is what every mathematician does. Literally all the time.

For instance set W = (M=(0, ..., n), f) where n is an integer and f a map from N to N. Now you want to introduce some kind of order. One option might be: use a  smooth function g from R to R and check if for a_i in M g(a_i) = a_{i+1}. 

Then try to find a way to derive a map f' from f and M. 
Now set W_0 = W and W_{i+1} = (f(M_i), f').

What properties does W_i have? What happens for i goes to infinity? How does the order change over time? Are there clusters with higher order? 

Then you can think about what that all means. And what effects do starting conditions have? Are there attractors to which the systems tend to evolve?

This is exactly the meaning of the Bloch sphere. Any quantum mechanical operation just moves the state around on the Bloch sphere.

In case of the task of formalizing notion of algorithm we have clear states that we can map.

When talking about open-endedness it is not the case unfortunately... Natural selection postulates can applied to parts of the model but open-endedness is a property of a model as a whole.

9805,"**Differential evolution**

In evolutionary computation, differential evolution (DE) is a method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Such methods are commonly known as metaheuristics as they make few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as DE do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found.

DE is used for multidimensional real-valued functions but does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means DE does not require the optimization problem to be differentiable, as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods.

1. What a qubit entangled system looks like
2. How the system can be transformed in a way to give you the correct answer
3. How to measure and obtain a result

\----------------

1. What a qubit entangled system looks like

From my understanding, what is happening is that a combination of n qubits produces a ""probability"" distribution for 2\^n possible states. Thus, for 4 qubits, it is like a sequence of 4 coins flipped, and state represented is a different permutation of the four coins and their status (heads or tails).

So we take the list of all 16 possible permutations, and we assign the probability of it occurring to each outcome, and we store it in an ordered list, otherwise known as a tuple, a vector, etc. I call it a vector.

Thus, an n qubit system is equivalent to a vector of 2\^n size!

In reality its not really a probability in each slot, but its actually a complex number, like .5 + .5i.

When you ""measure"" this vector, what happens is that the probability of a state occurring is the length of that complex number, so that .5 + .5i becomes  71% probability.

Of course, the lengths of all the pseudoprobabilities add up to 1.

Some therefore like to think of the qubit as a vector in a ball, pointing from the inside to the outside, always with length 1 (due to probabilities adding up to 1) like this:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit#/media/File:Bloch\_sphere.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit#/media/File:Bloch_sphere.svg)

\---------------------

2. How the system can be transformed in a way to give you the correct answer

It turns out that through the application of different gates, you can transform the vector representation of the qubit system. This is done through a matrix multiplication.

In other words, passing the qubit system through a gate has the effect of multiplying the vector by a matrix and reassigning that vector value.

Thus, the pseudoprobability of every possible state that can be represented by the qubits is being transformed at once.

Also, its possible to reduce probabilities in a state to zero.

\----------------------

3. How to measure and obtain a result

I don't know how physicists measure a qubit system. What I do know is that once measured, each state can be selected with a probability. This probability is equal to the magnitude of their value in the vector.

Quantum algorithmic science tries to find ways to transform the qubit system in such a way that undesirable results  have probabilities reduced to 0, and vice versa for the correct results.

In the ideal case, the correct answer is chosen with probability 1.

&amp;#x200B;

1. &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A qubit can contain any mixture of **0** and **1**. I just want to make it clear that it doesn't have a special third state called ""both **0** and **1**."" It's just that the qubit can have any percentage of **1**\-ness, including 0% or 100%.

This allows you to build inputs that are % mixtures of different values. Let's say I have two qubits, the first is 30% **1** and the second is 50% **1**. Well, it's equivalent to say that my qubit *pair* is 35% **00**, 25% **01**, 15% **10**, 15% **11**.

Now let's do the AND gate operation on that qubit pair. The output should only be **1** in the input=**11** case, which only constitutes 15% of the input. So, the output of my AND operation will be 75% **0**, 15% **1**. You could think of this as the gate trying all possible 'routes': it applied the AND on each of the four inputs within the superposition. The result is the corresponding mixture of outputs.

People like to sneer at the idea that a quantum computer is taking all the possible computational paths simultaneously, but really it is. The important thing to emphasize is that you don't get to see all the results. If I measure the output of my AND example, it's going to randomly collapse to either **0** or **1**. So it's important to stress to people that a quantum computer doesn't have this limitless power of executing infinitely many things for us simultaneously. Internally it does *do* something magical like that, but it takes clever tricks to get anything useful out of the results. I think this partly answers your question 3: the output is a mixture of outputs corresponding to the input mixture.

2)

&amp;#x200B;

Think of my qubit pair from the previous example. It's possible for the pair to be in a state like 50% **00**, 50% **11**. So each qubit is 50% **1**, but not independently from each other. If you measure either of them, you'll know which state the pair was in, and subsequently the value of the other qubit. They are correlated, or 'entangled' If you are interested please see my layperson explanation in another comment of how entanglement is a powerful tool in quantum computing. [https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/dmi7ss/how\_is\_entanglement\_used\_to\_calculate\_in\_qc/f51chsr?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/dmi7ss/how_is_entanglement_used_to_calculate_in_qc/f51chsr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

It also addresses the rest of question 3. The output is the mixture of results corresponding to the mixture of inputs. We don't get to see all the results, which is why quantum computers aren't infinitely powerful. We can only find out certain *overall* properties of inputs and outputs and how they interact.",1574016811,QuantumComputing,ironclownfish,Quantum,Comment,463

9856,"If you're asking about Google's quantum supremacy, John Martinis discussed this (for a technical audience) in his November 1st talk at Caltech and was very convincing. 

While one can't prove the Google random sampling result is accurate without taking some non-rigorous shortcuts, one can take those shortcuts and then extrapolate to a very convincing level. 

For example: if I remember right, Google's supremacy algorithm involves running circuits on 53 arbitrarily entangled qubits, executing something like 14 layers of gates. You can probably simulate the full circuit for 10 layers of gates. So first you compare a run of 10 layers. It's nearly perfect. It seems reasonable to think a few more layers would be just as good, but you should still check further. So now you run 14 layers of two circuits, a 26-qubit one and a 27-qubit one, then stitch them together. This is also very much doable on a classical computer. The results have some uncertainty due to not allowing fully arbitrary entanglement, but they are quite close to the quantum result. You do this again with another method of simplifying the circuit (I forget the details) and it looks great. Things are looking pretty good at this point. Then you compare your error rates and other performance metrics to known physics and you find that that matches absurdly well also. Based on Martinis' talk, the level to which this device's performance is in line with known, predictable physics is extremely impressive, to the point of being somewhat surprising.

You repeat this a bunch of times and try plenty of similar stuff, you declare supremacy, and then you move on to something more verifiable like Shor's algorithm or chemistry simulations because at this point it's gotten boring.

It's not perfect, but the evidence is very convincing that it's reasonable to call this a significant win for Google's machine. IBM and others may quibble about details and language, but even their scientists have agreed in public settings that Google's work is a very important, very impressive achievement, and that the physics and computer science are both very solid.

So, we have a home for independent learners and thinkers, and we help each other grow.

Bigger picture, if you want to serve clients on quantum computing (occasionally, part time, or eventually full time), you can get invited to join the team as an associate.  We sell projects to commercial clients and pay well.

9954,Sure. Lower error rates is of course better. But no error rate is going to give you large scale quantum computing with 53 qubits.,1573462924,QuantumComputing,The_Serious_Account,Quantum,Comment,24
9955,"&gt; In terms of error rate we are not that far off,

Well we are sort of still far off since the better the error rates are, the smaller the distance needs to be for any error correction scheme.

For superconducting, it will be impossible to get it better than 5 or 6 nines. But if we could hit that, a logical qubit would be able to be really rather ""small"".",1573449246,QuantumComputing,EngSciGuy,Quantum,Comment,71
9956,"I am not sure which ""state initialization process"" you are referring to here. Perhaps cooling down the motional modes of the crystal before executing a circuit? The latter does not really influence the gate time, even for two-qubit gates.

Regarding gate time and fidelity, generally shorter gates suffer from less decoherence, which improves the fidelity, but require more careful control to avoid off-resonant excitation and similar higher-order effects. (Higher drive power is also required, of course.) This isn't really specific to trapped ions.

For two-qubit gates in ions, things also get trickier once you approach the motional frequencies of the crystal (see e.g. the recent paper from our lab, where a 99.8%-fidelity two-qubit gate at 1.6µs was demonstrated: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature25737).",1573425552,QuantumComputing,klickverbot,Quantum,Comment,119
9957,"* Usability: see the recent Google result, and the cloud access from IBM and Rigetti. 
* Capabilities are very basic and primarily for proof of concept and education. IBM has quantum computers with something along the lines of 5, 15, and 53 qubits available in the cloud. You can do anything you want with them; i.e. run any quantum or classical algorithm that can be mapped to that number of qubits and the circuit depth they allow. But at this point nobody is going to beat a classical computer except in very specific ways; if something like, say, Shor's algorithm were doable at any useful scale, I doubt it would be free or perhaps even accessible at all to the public at the beginning.
* Yes, the computers mentioned above are actual quantum computers. That's the point of Google's paper and of the cloud services.
* Limitations/improvements: I think a good (opinionated) summary is that we need fault tolerance and scalability. Fault tolerance will likely be achieved after improvements in error rates and perhaps algorithms. Scalability is basically an engineering problem--how to connect control systems to all the qubits, how to accurately fabricate and characterize them in large numbers, etc. All of this covers tons of different individual problems and efforts, from physics to materials science to math to engineering to computer science. 

Will Oliver's recent column in Nature, Scott Aaronson's blog, Dennis Overbye's article on quantum supremacy in the NY Times, and John Preskill's various popular-level articles are very good reading for understanding where the field is at the moment.

The pertinent information to me has been that the BIG players are pouring BILLIONS into Artificial Intelligence AND it seems like everybody is opening up their build-outs (i.e. YOU can get on an Ibm Qiskit instance right now at no charge...)

I use HP wire to keep up with the High Performance Computing news, but you also need to be aware of what is going on at National Labs: Between the massive amounts of money being spent and the cross-pollination across disciplines, my best guess it that we should see major progress in the next 5 years.  However, much of the improvements may go unnoticed by the general public.

9968,"Regarding the recent Google- NASA article on quantum supremacy. That is a very specific implementation for a specific problem, not a generic search. That's why the speed up is even more impressive than for generic Grover search.

You cannot infer from this that all quantum algorithms will have such a speedup.",1573398074,QuantumComputing,Mquantum,Quantum,Comment,51
9969,"First a sufficient number of logical qubits will be needed (a few thousand), which requires, as far as current knowledge goes, a factor of around x1000  more physical qubits, for error correction. Thus we are speaking of the order of one-ten million physical qubits. If we are optimistic and assume an exponential growth in the number of physical qubits per chip, this will require 10-20 years.

Once you have such a fault-tolerant machine, you may perform long calculations (meaning minutes or hours). In particular you will be able to use Grover search algorithm and Shor factoring algorithm. Grover search is (very) loosely related to your post. Related to hashing, instead of needing a number of searches of the order of 2^N where N is the bit security of the hash (typically N=256), Grover will need 2^(N/2) searches. It's like using a hash wih 128bits of security. Not so bad, but not so disrupting. Instead of some trillions of years, it will take some millions to directly forge a block. For mining, it will speed it up, but not dramatically. I can find a reference if you want to know more.

Shor algorithm is another story. Instead of finding the factors of a prime number of binary size N in around 2^N time (the best classical algo is a bit faster than that), it will find them in a time N^a  , where a is a small number. So the problem will become polynomial. This will completely break RSA and also ECDSA which is used by most blockchains for signatures.

Essentially a fault tolerant quantum computer will be able to derive the private key of a cryptocurrency wallet from its public key, provided the latter has been exposed (for example 1 million  Satoshi's bitcoin).

Some blockchains have indeed already implemented post-quantum cryptography, to replace ECDSA. The reason is that once a public key is revealed (when spending coins) there's no coming back, unless you personally move all the coins to another address which has not revealed its public ECDSA key. So there is a lot of say, bitcoin, which will remain vulnerable unless all the involved people will personally act.",1573397845,QuantumComputing,Mquantum,Quantum,Comment,359
