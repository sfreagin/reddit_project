Measurement of the distance Sun-center of the Galaxy,1616961387,"Hello everyone! 
I am mere astrophysics student and I have dilemma with my project with a geometric measurement of the distance: Sun - center of the Galaxy. Let me explain..

I’m using Shapleys method. At first, I add RR Lyrae variable stars from few (about 30) globular clusters, which are located approx. centrally symmetric in our Galaxy. After a few calculations I can find distance around 8,4 kpc, not bad.
However, then I use the globular clusters situated nearby galactic equator. Suddenly, my new distance is 7.2. I thought, using these clusters should accurate my calculations, but it didn’t. How is that possible?

My second task is about comparing between open clusters and the brightest ones. Everything is OK, but the thing is the M45. Why does this open cluster greater galactic lattitude than the others? They should be around galactic equator, why is this not the case? 

Can’t find anything on the Internet, maybe you could help. Thanks!",astrophysics,Majkoslovak,/r/astrophysics/comments/mf8jhk/measurement_of_the_distance_suncenter_of_the/,3
I want to study mathematics and physics on my own. Do you have any advice or recommendation? What sources can I use?,1616957907,"This post is going to be long. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. 

At the age of 4 I used to be in love with space and astronomy. I had an encyclopedia at home and I used to read over and over again those pages about astronomy. Like everyone I wanted to be an astronaut but I gave up very quickly. I don't know why I gave up I was really dumb (and still am). But I'm also stubborn as hell, I upset so many people around me with my stubbornness.

Anyway life went on and I slowly started to become less and less interested in space. At least, not as much as I used to be when I was a kid. Though, I watched occasionally some documentaries that were on TV and I was vivified. I was a big fan of great scientists like Stephen Hawking, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku. But this wonder only lasted for a few days then I was becoming a fool without interests again.

When Stephen Hawking died in 2018 I was like touched in my flesh. It was like losing a close relative or something. I tried to rekindle my interest in space and it worked for a few months. I bought and read a few books, I watched documentaries and I learned many things. When I had to go to college I wanted to study space engineering but once again I gave up without even trying (sometimes I hate myself). I once again let go of my dreams and what really makes me feel like I exist. I started to study economy because it's kinda cool and especially because I wanted to get rich (did I tell you that I was dumb?).

Inevitably, I started to find no interest in this field. I faced the reality of college and I absolutely hate it. Plus, the fact that I was studying something that just doesn't suit me made me hate college and the school system even more. I really don't want to study in this system anymore. It doesn't suit me I can't find my place in it. Online classes are a mess I learn absolutely nothing. Did I tell you that I'm stubborn? I can be really annoying sometimes but that's how I am.

Anyway, I found a renewed interest in astronomy and I think this time it's serious. I've already lost 2 years studying things that I don't like and it really just makes me feel bad and useless. I don't see myself moving on. I'm motivated and I want to study mathematics and physics on my own. I just fell more in love with physics than I previously was. Particle physics, quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity give rhythm to my life.

I really need your help please. How can I study such things on my own? Do you have any advice or recommendations? Thank you for reading me.",astrophysics,isma6k,/r/astrophysics/comments/mf7bwe/i_want_to_study_mathematics_and_physics_on_my_own/,20

Average Speed of Earth,1615955344," Hello all,

I have a physic question where I need to find the average speed of Earth while it orbits around the sun with the following information:

1. Eccentricity = 0,0167
2. Period of Revolution = 365,25 days
3. Semi Major Axis = 1,49\*10\^11

I'm trying to find the answer with the following equation, but no success:

Vm = \[(2\* *π* \*a)/T \] \* (1-e²)\^-1/2

I'm also putting a screenshot of all the formulas we will have at our exam. Our teacher insists that we can successfully answer all the questions with only those formulas.

Is anyone able to find 30km/s or 30'000m/s with the list of formula I just provided :O

I know that there are other way to find the speed of Earth, but it usually requires the radius of the Earth and the Mass of the Sun.

Thank you all in advance

"Stars, Supernova, Dimensions, and Black holes question",1615718803,"When a star goes supernova it creates a black hole right. Alright, I have been trying to figure out 4th-dimensional concepts with 3d compared to 2d and I found out if you squeeze a 2d object on all sides, it could break into the 3rd dimension which makes sense. So, when stars implode because of gravity, does that mean that they squeezed themselves on all sides and broke into the 4th dimension? I might sound dumb because I don't know much and I'm still learning and understand most concepts. Anyways, that makes a black hole right? So, if the star broke into the 4th dimension doesn't that mean it would've made a hole into another plane of existence or 3d space because something 3d is now in a 4th-dimensional direction which makes sense on why the gravity is really strong in that specific spot. Also, the reason why you move through time when in a black hole. That would mean that you are leaving your time and space coordinates and moving to completely new coordinates.

"I have some quick questions about time dilation, but backwards.",1615608707,"I'm only 16 and have only ever ""studied"" astrophysics on my own time for fun and out of curiosity, so my bad if I come across as dumb or I don't make sense.


Anyway, from the little I probably understand about time dilation, the faster you move, the faster time goes around you.


Based on this, I'd assume that since Earth is moving over a million miles per hour, that if you went in some kind of space ship and left the Milky Way's orbital ""bubble"" or whatever you would call it so that you would no longer be moving over a million miles per hour, and managed to stop completely, going almost 0 miles per hour, you would have lived x amount of years while people back on Earth would have experienced less than x amount of years.


So now based on all that, here are my questions:


       1.   Say I wanted to build a weapons factory or something and I put it on some kind of space ship and sent it out of our Galaxy and made it go about 1 mile per hour through intergalactic space. Let's say I let it manufacture the weapons for about 5 earth years, then I theoretically somehow teleport the ship back to Earth. Would the factory on the ship have produced the weapons significantly faster than it would have produced them on Earth? 


      2.    What if I made the ship go exactly 0 miles per hour somehow. So it wouldn't be floating anywhere or anything like that. It would just be completely still. How would time dilation work with that if 0 cannot be multiplied? Would it have been experiencing an unlimited amount of time or am I just being stupid right now?


       3.     Based on the fact that time dilates as you go faster, I'd guess that time travelling backwards is impossible, since (although I may be wrong) you can't go negative speed. Another reason would be that there would be two of you, which (I think) is impossible. I can't see why dilating time would be able to (kind of) create human life. Is this true?

Refracting Light and how an anomaly would be identified via Telescope?,1615415794,"Hello all,

This is causing a light shift as the structure rotates in space after the course of this sample taken via telescope.

Question about Gravitational Redshift,1615352909,"  So I'm a high-school sophomore reading A Brief History Of Time you know the gist, probably heard it a thousand times already, but I've been stuck on a single paragraph trying to wrap my head around it, and it's this one: 

&gt;Another prediction of general relativity is that time should appear to slower near a massive body like the earth. This is because there is a relation between the energy of light and its frequency (that is, the number of waves of light per second): the greater the energy, the higher frequency. As light travels upward in the earth’s gravitational field, it loses energy, and so its frequency goes down. (This means that the length of time between one wave crest and the next goes up.) To someone high up, it would appear that everything down below was making longer to happen. This prediction was tested in 1962, using a pair of very accurate clocks mounted at the top and bottom of a water tower. The clock at the bottom, which was nearer the earth, was found to run slower, in exact agreement with general relativity.

It was super interesting and I understood the basics of it; closer to stronger gravitational force = greater energy = greater frequency, but then that somehow causes us to somehow go slower, and so I did some researching and found out it has to do with something called 'Gravitational Redshift'. What I don't understand is *why* time is slower due to an increase in frequency. The answer is probably obvious but I have been thinking about it all day and still can't understand why this is, is it because an increase in the frequency leads to us absorbing so much at once that we can't keep up with someone further away from the gravitational force? Some help would be appreciated, thanks!",astrophysics,ChalenderPR,/r/astrophysics/comments/m1pzzn/question_about_gravitational_redshift/,5

Astrophysics graduate school: US PhD programs or EU Masters -&gt; PhD,1615312201,"I am a physics major and astronomy minor senior graduating in May 2021. Most of the astrophysics graduate programs I applied to were PhD programs in the USA that I can move into right after my bachelor's, but I applied to some master's in astrophysics in EU schools. As of now, I was offered a spot into two US PhD programs (PM for details), and I was offered a spot in the Master's of Astrophysics program at KU Leuven. I was wondering what are the pros and cons between entering an astrophysics PhD program straight out of your undergraduate (which is the case for many US programs) versus entering an astrophysics masters program at one school, and then continuing to pursue your PhD at another school? 

One of the reasons I ask is because one of my family member´s has a concern that, with the latter route, I won´t really be ¨settled down¨ in one spot again, I won´t have financial support (TA or RA) for masters and I have to go through the process of applying again for a PhD position, which I could avoid if I just go to a US school.",astrophysics,EpicGusher,/r/astrophysics/comments/m1byls/astrophysics_graduate_school_us_phd_programs_or/,3

HOW TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN,1614890510,"Hey guys, hope you all are doing good! So this one's about my regrets and me trying to do my little bit to catch up, I'm not a great writer so y'all will have to bear with me. 

Ok so talking about me I'm 19 and I'm currently doing my undergraduate in business administration. So from the past two years I noticed that I stopped watching YouTube or surfing internet for random  videos like pranks, funny vids etc but instead I started watching alot of science, history, philosophy videos and other informative stuff. And over the years after talking to this certain person who's extremely fond of astrophysics I found out that this is what interests me too!! The world, bio-diversity, the universe, physics, philosophy, psychology and everything and I instantly regretted taking commerce after my schooling.(I didn't like science or math in school bc I didn't find it interesting or the teacher) First of all the reason I took commerce bc it seemed easier and less head-breaking than science. But NOW when I watch NDT, Feynman and other content or reach or  talk to people - I find it very compelling and after talking to a lot of people who did take science I came to know that it was all self study, that they were interested in the field in the first place because of reading or watching stuff outside of school's syllabus. 

So now I want a guide on how I can learn science, astrophysics to be precise, on my own. I can devote 30mins-1hr per day learning the subject. Not professionally, but just so I can read stuff or look at the night sky and not contemplate mindlessly (seems good for a start). 

Thanks for bearing with this and making it till the end. Have a great day!

Big Things Hitting Big Things In Space,1614263402,"So I have a few questions about things hitting things in space.

     - a black hole hits a star at least 4x the diameter.  Does it shoot through like a bullet?  Does it get ‘stuck’?  Does it pull mass from the star as it approaches?
     - Same situation but the object is more solid that a star, say a planet?


These questions come from me thinking about Dyson Spheres and what it would take to damage or crack one.  Purely theoretical and Sci-Fi yes but, in real life application, the above situations must have happened or will happen at some point.

Starting out on a journey into astronomy/astrophysics as a layman,1614162920,"Hi all, 

I've always been fascinated with looking up at the night sky and admiring the stars. It isn't until recently though, that I've sought out more about what really goes on out there and it has more than grabbed me. What draws me the most, is the amount of amazing and extreme conditions exist out there, even though they still adhere to the same laws and physics we know here on earth.  I'm also very drawn in by the idea that the universe is basically our biggest unknown, undiscovered 'place' we have left. There is still so much to learn and discover out there. Here be dragons!

The subject interests me to no end, reading about it, watching video's about it.. Basically consuming all media I can find. Right now I'm on Neil Degrasse Tyson's 'Astrophysics for people in a hurry' and plan to start 'Welcome to the Universe' and related problem-book next. 

Now I've realized I really do want to learn more about it on a theoretical level. Problem is, I'm 30 now and missed my shot at formally studying anything related to it about 12 years ago. I never studied anything related to sciences and was always pretty horrible at maths. I don't have any scientific background, since as a teen I was more interested in languages and literature. When it comes to maths, physics and any science, I'm a layman.

I do want to pick it up though. I want to learn, improve my knowledge in those fields. Except that I don't really know where or how to start, except from the very start. I was hoping someone here might have some advice for me.

I know I'm basically an illiterate, asking for a road map to writing poetry. I know I'm asking to learn something people take years upon years to study. I know that it's probably a little too courageous (or foolish), but I really hope to learn.

Theory,1613726250,"I dont think that this could be possible and i belive in good ol' physics but i thought of this at 2 in the morning and thought it would be worth a try! (The spaces are for diagrams i havent yet drawn)   

Theory: Space time is not flat but it is in the shape of an oval but we perceive it as flat. Meaning at a really early point of the universe you would have a wormhole between the 2 sides. This could take 1 maybe 2 black holes to pierce through and create a wormhole (you would need something with high gravity to pierce through. This process grows harder and harder as space time expands because gravity isn’t strong enough to pierce through to the other side. What’s inside the Oval? Dark matter/energy. It would give a reason why the universe is expanding and why we cant detect it, it is under the fabric of time, a cotton of sorts, keeping it inflated and the cotton is multiplying. And as it expands space time grows bigger and bigger pushing galaxies away and leaving darkness.

Maybe dark energy/matter could leak out from somewhere or when a wormhole is formed and that’s the stuff we theorized of.

You wouldn’t be able to cross the wormholes unless you are faster than light because singularity’s still exist and maybe once they come together they form a mega singularity that behaves and acts the same way as a single singularity.

You would HAVE to be faster than light because you don’t want to be trapped inside the bridge as it closes because you would be trapped in the singularity and black holes move, meaning that wormholes are rare and you only have a small window of time to get through before your chance is lost and you would have to get another rare window of time and locate exactly where and when the 2 blackholes would come together. Everything has the same properties except Dark matter/energy which I gave a purpose. The black holes would have to be supermassive to pierce through right about now and supermassive blackholes are rare because they need the death of a large star.

Black holes are always moving away and eventually meeting again once they fully go round about space time which would grow impossible as space time grows because they have a larger space to travel.

Space time expands so gravity isn’t strong enough to pierce through once it expands.

The singularities could maybe conjoin and then separate or maybe the singularities could annihilate each other like particles and anti-particles and cause an infinitely lasting wormhole  which dies when the blackhole dies.",astrophysics,Jakub_is_the_best,/r/astrophysics/comments/lnbmzg/theory/,2

Sun’s increasing luminosity over time,1613349179,"Why does the sun’s (and other comparable main sequence stars’) core mass increase as it fuses hydrogen? I understand the sun’s luminosity increases as it ages. The layman’s explanation I’ve heard regarding this process is the following: as helium builds up in the sun’s core—and that helium cannot (yet) fuse—the core’s mass increases. This increase in mass causes more inward gravitational force and, in turn, the core and remainder of the star along with it becomes hotter and brighter. 

My confusion is this: when hydrogen fuses into helium there is a (very small) loss of mass, and that loss is explained by the release of significant energy. And the the core I thought was relatively “sealed off” from most of the rest of the star’s hydrogen.   So, given that, I would expect the core to loose mass over time, not gain it. Clearly I’m not understanding something (probably many things) correctly.",astrophysics,vomerala,/r/astrophysics/comments/lk1fc4/suns_increasing_luminosity_over_time/,4
Wondering if Astrophysics is for me/brick wall in university,1613343830,"Hey all, I'm a university student (only in my first year) in the US studying to get a BS in physics and a BS in astronomy/astrophysics. In my first semester, I took an intro astrophysics class, which is the first course in my major sequence, and absolutely fell in love. It was essentially a survey of astronomy, stellar astrophysics, cosmology, galactic astrophysics, etc. While it was not terribly intense, it did have some physics (basic mechanics, e&amp;m, and very rudimentary relativity). The class through and through was brilliant and I loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now in an intro mech course for physics majors and I feel like I've hit a brick wall. I'm really having trouble with it (and the professor is... less than optimal, there are no lectures and no readings, but I don't blame him entirely). Strangely, I'm in an abstract linear algebra course and I also love that and have had surprisingly little difficulty thus far. That's not to boast or anything, I guess I just find it frustrating that I'm struggling with the class that's ""easier"" (not that it actually is).

Say I was on an EVA from the ISS, and decided to take a tennis ball with me. What would happen if I decided to aim it at the earth and throw it as hard as I could?

Newton's first law states that an object will stay in the same state of motion until another force acts upon it, so surely it would continue heading towards the earth? Relative to me, the ball would keep speeding off into the distance until I lose all visibility, what happens next? Does it somehow cancel all forward velocity and decide to follow a lower orbit? or does it continue to move forward and enter the atmosphere?

Surely it can't just keep going forward because that would make space travel a ton easier.

Research Question help,1612402742,"Hello everybody,

We have to write a research paper of sorts for school and I chose Physics as my subject to write it on.  My initial research question was, ""How does distance from the Earth affect a star's parallax angle?"" I felt the question was too bland and  it was very easy to answer so I changed it to, ""Does  the type of a galaxy affect angular velocity (Ie: Would spiral galaxies have a greater angular velocity than elliptical), I then realised that it isn't easy at all to measure the angular velocity of galaxies and there isn't that much data available. I'm now trying to choose between, ""How does a star's mass affect angular velocity?"" and ""How does the spectral class of a star affect angular velocity?"" I was wondering if these topics would be feasible to write a 2000 word paper on and if the topics are alright or does anything need to be changed?

Question about black holes from a layman,1612210475,"As far as I understand it (and please correct me as I'm sure I don't understand it properly), Black holes go through passive and active periods, during which surrounding material is torn apart by tidal forces and is 'sucked' in to form an accretion disk around the black hole. At some point, this material is totally or partially converted into massive 'flares' from the poles in the forms of gamma ray bursts that blast out perpendicular to the galactic disk. As a part of this interaction, a portion of the mass of the black hole is bled off or 'evaporated' as gravitational waves are produced when black holes interact with other large masses.

Assuming this is partially correct at least, isn't a black hole essentially functioning as a gigantic mass to energy converter? Is there a total amount of energy that it can convert before it evaporates to the point where it becomes negligible or can black holes last forever? How much of a galaxy can be converted from mass to energy by a single black hole?

(Un)popular opinion: on the (im)possibility of planet colonization and post-earth human life.,1612048779,"Greetings good people, I hope you are healthy and finding enough spare time to look at the stars every now and then... And maybe read through these lines. 

The future of our species is a most interesting and important topic that concerns each one of us regardless of our background, interests and formation. The rather precarious situation in which humans have put themselves into, as well as the somewhat instinctive and innate tone of the topic itself, makes it a clear go-to for our science fiction culture and arts whenever we are in need for good stories (Interstellar, the Martian... You know, fine, totally enjoyable, thought-provoking movies. Not to mention gorgeous books like 2001). However, as I am an astrophysicist myself, I cannot help but to meticulously analyze at some point the movie or book. I usually do not care about the supposed physics that are used as a background to tell the story, I am talking about the possibility that the main events in the artpiece may be futile and, to an extreme, absurd. Please, allow me to explain myself.

Planet colonization and the continuation of our species in another world seems impossible to me. It may be required if we ought to keep living at all, but it is just non accessible to us in our current evolutionary stage. We are a consequence of the unique characteristics of our parent planet and, as such, we are in a way a reflection of it. I like to think that, in the eyes of a superior intelligence (whatever that means to you) , a single human is all that is needed to infer basic characteristics of our entire planet.

For this reason I believe headers such as ""discovered planets within our solar neighborhood that may be more apt for life than earth"" are utterly ridiculous  (I swear I found something on those lines, I'm not making it up) . I'm sure that no planet is as suitable for our diversification than Earth. I'm not saying by any means that we shouldn't invest time, money and effort in finding said potentially habitable planets nor I am discouraging the use of interplanetary colonization for our cultural purposes. However, we are yet to unfold the complex relationship between us and our lands in its entirety, for some planetary characteristics are deeply ingrained in our genetic code and body functions. For instance, think about hormone cycles, or our visual range in the spectrum, that coincides for good reason with the emission peak of a blackbody of the temperature of the solar photosphere, or the thickness of our skin and fat layers, functional within certain temperature ranges... Humans can only survive in the environment that evolved them. I think that stating otherwise is really risky.

Who knows, maybe our universe provides us very similar planets in the future, maybe human adaptability is more plastic than initially thought, even in a genetic level. Or maybe this is our only possible choice folks, maybe all life beyond Earth is not life at all, maybe we have forgotten our identity with our home and overlooked too many factors to take into account when seriously thinking about the viability of colonization.

These are just some of my personal opinions and I did not write all them down. I'll be more than glad to hear yours. What do you think?",astrophysics,m_cano,/r/astrophysics/comments/l8yk9q/unpopular_opinion_on_the_impossibility_of_planet/,10

Does gravity take time to travel like light?,1612028528,"I am aware this might sound very stupid. I am not a scientist, I just have scientific curiosity.

So, I understand that if all of a sudden our Sun just disappeared it would take around 8 minutes for us to notice the change in light because it has to travel from the sun to earth. 

My question is, would gravity behave in the same way? I mean, obviously  we are in an orbit around the sun as it travels through the galaxy, if it disappeared would the earth go flying in a straight line? Would it take 8 minutes for the Orbit to disappear as well? Would there be some kind of gravitational tsunami because the sun would just disappear?

Hopefully some of this makes sense. If someone could explain the answer in layman's terms I would appreciate it a lot. I've had this doubt for years!

Question about accelerated expansion of the universe.,1611939751,"I understand the concept of redshift and blueshift to measure the direction and speed of cosmic objects and I get how considering most objects are red shifted you can assume that things are expanding.  One statement that I am always hung up on is where people say that expansion is acceleration because more distant objects are more red shifted than closer objects.  My hang up is that at a cosmic scale, distance and time are heavily interrelated when talking about observation.  To me the statement should read that more distant objects WERE travelling faster.  I have to assume that people in astrophysics know what they are talking about and would not overlook something this obvious, but I feel like I never see it addressed.  To me it feels like they talk about logical step 1 and then skip logical step 2 and 3 to talk about the conclusion ""the expansion is accelerating!""  To me, the fact that more distant objects are travelling faster would indicate that the expansion is decelerating because our observation of more distant objects are what the universe looked like further in the past.

My theory on wormholes: The impossibility that they exist.,1611649460,"   If we start from the wormhole theory, which states that if two black holes are close enough they can distorts space-time enough to tear it apart. But this theory is flawed on several points. 

   First of all, if we follow the definition of space-time as Einstein described it, the space is curved by the objects it doesn’t matter how big they are, even if it’s to varying degrees. But, if two black holes are close enough to create this hole, they should naturally attract each other and so it creates problems in basic physics as we know it. 

   Let’s take an example to demonstrate this. If we take the experience of aluminum sheets, we can simply refute the wormhole theory. 

   This experiment consists of placing two sheets of aluminium very close to each other and vacuum in the space in which they are located. The leaves stick to each other, by gravitational pull and quantum. It is is also used in quantum.

   Similarly, if we use this example as an analogy with our black holes, wormholes cannot exist. We can therefore conclude that this theory, as sublime and mystical as it is, cannot be demonstrated by physics current.",astrophysics,MyticPvP88,/r/astrophysics/comments/l59oz2/my_theory_on_wormholes_the_impossibility_that/,0

Need some help with coding GW waveforms using pycbc.,1610982889,"So I have been trying plot a couple of waveforms with pycbc and I am kinda stuck.
First plot is a regular waveform with masses known and orbital plane inclination given with azimuthal angle = 0. That I was able plot with pycbc.waveform.get_td_waveform.
Second is the same as the first, but with azimuthal angle = 45 deg. So for this I couldn't find how to set that angle. The plot looks basically the same just a bit shifted from the first one.
Third is a bit tricky. So there is something called type II image for gravitational lensing. This waveform should coincide with the second waveform I mentioned above. But to plot this, you have to take a Hilbert transform of the first waveform I mentioned, with an added 1/2 into the equation. I was told to put sgn(f) = 1/2 in the hilbert transform equation and code up the equation for the fourier transform. I couldn't do the transform successfully and the transformed waveform did not look anything like what I wanted to get.

For a school project, me and my team trying to find a way how we can remove space debris from Earth's orbit. We're currently looking into how we can cancel a spin of a rouge satellite (which we want to capture).

We want to know how much rotational force (in Newton) the satellite has. That way, we also know exactly how much friction force we need to create to get the satellite to stop spinning.

After trying to apply some formulas we calculated that our CubeSat has 0,834 Newton of rotational force which we have to cancel. However, we don't know if this is correct.

"Causality of not finding life in the universe, so far",1610920394,"Hey, I'm somewhat bad at explanations, especially when it comes to things I don't, or barely understand. But isn't it, kind of, logical that we haven't found intelligent life so far?  
Our first neigbouring galaxy, Andromeda, is 2.5m ly away. So, we see whatever happened 2.5m ly before now, is that correct? I'll explain why this is important in just a moment. Now, modern humans exist for about 100,000 years. But to be real - actual modern human exists for about 150 years if even, when it comes to understanding universe, physics, atoms, electricity, computing power, 3G-4G-5G etc. And we barely know anything actually. We're having terrible trouble even sending simple machines to other celestial bodies, that are very close to us. Meaning - we're barely advanced as species in any sense, our tech very primitive for now.  
Now to return to Andromeda - we're seeing what happened a long, long time ago. And that's just our first neighbour. We can't really see in the future, but we're able to see in the past, in principle - but maybe conditions weren't the same, and life just began sprawling recently, on a global scale?

Anyhow, one more point:  
""Physicist and futurist Michio Kaku suggested that, if **humans** increase their energy consumption at an average rate of **3** percent each year, they may attain **Type** I status in 100–200 years, **Type** II status in a few thousand years, and **Type III** status in 100,000 to a million years.""  
So, even if Andromeda was thriving, or maybe even completely harvested by some other beings - we wouldn't know about it.  
Pretty much same goes for us - we're looking for life now, but even if we achieve type 3 in next 1m years -- our primitive brethren from Andromeda wouldn't know it.   
And again, that's just first galaxy next to us, not to mention all the others that are even more ridiculously far away.  
And that's without pointing our many more facts like size of the (just observable) universe or Fermi paradox.

In the end, how i see it, is that all humanity is just an infant on this unfathomable time scale, not knowing anything about anything.",astrophysics,sibi33,/r/astrophysics/comments/kzfxve/causality_of_not_finding_life_in_the_universe_so/,22

Are there any good resources to learn practical data analysis and research methods for astrophysics?,1610653663,"I have a degree in physics with an astrophysics minor, however due to very poor luck with scheduling and covid-19 issues, I never got to take the course offered at my university that taught how to use telescopes and analyze the data they collect, all my education was purely text based theory. I really regret not getting to take that course both because I find the topic really interesting, and I may one day wish to continue my education into astrophysics grad school. However, without that knowledge I feel like I could be at a disadvantage if I were to try. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all that said, I was wondering if anyone knew of any resources that instruct people on how to do data collection and analysis with real telescopes and data (emphasis on real, or something that simulates real data). Any sort of resource would be greatly beneficial, from textbooks, youtube lectures, websites, etc, and in particular if you know of any courses taught online by universities that would be greatly beneficial.

I can imagine resources that teach how to use telescopes might be few and far between without access to actual telescopes, however there might be some training simulations/programs you may know about. That said, even information on data analysis techniques would be awesome on its own.

Possible giant brown star ?,1610544196,"Hey there physicists,

I've had something on my mind for quite a while.

What if, by random chance, you had a star formation in a heavy element rich environment. But so rich that a decent part of it is iron or even heavier.

As i understand, they would form a central core, akin to what we have inside of earth. 

Hydrogen keeps on fusing into helium, helium forms a layer outside of the iron core, incapable of going deeper because of density.

But then at one point, because your helium (or any other fused element heavier) is far from the center, it doesn't reach high enough pressures to fuse further, and you start running out of hydrogen.
At that point, the fusion's outward push should no longer counteract gravity, and the star should collapse and go supernova.

 I'm sure there is a way to tweek the variables so that it wouldn't happen explode and collapse and go dark eventually. 

The way i see it could be theorized:
Ms is mass if the star

MFe is mass if the iron core

Mf Mass of fusable = Ms - MFe (decreasing because of e=mc^2)

rFe is the radius of core

ŕHe is the radius at which pressure is sufficient to fuse helium 



So here is my question: can you find a set of Ms and  MFe so that there exist ŕHe&lt;rFe even after fusion has stopped and there is a thick layer of condensed helium above an iron core. (Which would have made ŕHe considerably bigger)",astrophysics,thenameischef,/r/astrophysics/comments/kwgc5q/possible_giant_brown_star/,3

And then it struck me - there are similar particle shapes in neutron stars: ions which are stretched by extremely intense magnetic fields have to be present in their crusts and those exibit exotic form of tectonics. Sure, those are not same particles, but there is an analogy in the fact both show certain form of anisotropy in their movement, which translates to specific macroscopic phenomenons.

Could this be of some importance to the dynamics in those systems? I imagine it very well could affect how the crust moves and causes starquakes.

Support for science fiction horror film script needed!,1610019624,"Hi everyone, I'm screenwriter based in the UK and I'm currently writing a science fiction horror film. I'm looking to connect with a couple of astrophysicists that may be able to support with ensuring my work is on point from a science point of view and maybe help with coming up with ideas around a cosmic event.

Unfortunately, at this point, I'm just a man with a dream and can't offer any financial compensation for  sharing your invaluable knowledge. At the moment this is a passion project, but who knows where it could go.

**Project background**

I originally wrote a short film called The Sky, which I then produced with a director friend of mine. We've been fortunate enough to get a great response on youtube, with just over 380k views and lots of positive comments. This motivated us to evolve the story and to write a feature version, which we hope to pitch to some of our contacts and maybe one day get made.

You can watch the short film here: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln4lDjT8Ab0&amp;t=7s&amp;ab\_channel=MattSears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln4lDjT8Ab0&amp;t=7s&amp;ab_channel=MattSears)

The feature film idea will be quite different to this, but it should give you an idea of the essence of the project. It will be primarily horror, and will follow a story around the imminent end of the world due to a cosmic event. However, the idea behind the concept also focuses heavily on themes of family, existentialism and morality. 

The science behind why the world is coming to an end was never fully explored in our short film. This is because the apocalypse itself is really only the backdrop of the story – it's more about exploring how humans would act and treat one another if they knew for certain the world was ending with several years' notice. 

For the feature length script, I don't want to neglect the scientific reasoning behind the cosmic event. Though the apocalypse will still be a backdrop, I'll need to explain what is really happening to give the audience enough information to follow the story easily. I'll also need to portray realistic conditions for whatever I decide the cosmic event to be. For example, if an asteroid was to hit Earth, I'd need to show the physical conditions leading up to the impact, as well as the impact itself etc.

**If you'd like to help**

If you'd like to be involved in helping me figure these things out, please DM me and let me know a little about you and your background. Appreciate this is someone asking for your valuable expertise and time for free, so please know that any help is massively appreciated.

Question on gravity,1609995756,"Hey there guys, I'm a philosophy student far more educated in studies of humanities than in the natural sciences. I have a question regarding gravity's presence in outer space that may have a simple answer--but that answer has simply never been disclosed to me. I apologize if the question is stupid by this community's standards.

If you ask someone with no knowledge of physics or astronomy why astronauts float in space, they'll answer with the age-old truism that it's because there's no gravity in space. While I've accepted this for years, I've recently become curious--what influences the direction that astronauts float towards? Does everyone float in the same direction? What would cause some to float upwards, or to the left, etc...

My conclusion (based on absolutely nothing other than my own thought process) would be that astronauts float towards the nearest gravitational force, but if that's the case (again, probably not) wouldn't it be wrong to teach that there's ""no gravity in space"" ?

I would ideally like for this to be a ""simple"" project as I am using this for a class project that will be due in a few months. 

However, I also would appreciate other projects I could take on long-term that don't necessarily have to be TESS related. The only reason I mention TESS is due to the amount of public data they have given on exoplanets.

Does the universe really have a beginning?,1609703363,"Hi!

I think we have all the evidence that the universe is expanding, but this isn’t what I’m questioning. Rather, there seems to be consensus in the astrophysics and general scientific community that the universe has a beginning. To me, it seems far more logical to assume the universe has always existed. 

First and foremost, we KNOW that matter/energy can neither be created nor destroyed (please note that I am saying “matter/energy” as opposed to just “matter” which technically can be created from energy and vice versa). But taking a step back from the physics and simply using pure logic, how can anyone believe that something can arise from nothing? If something truly came from nothing, that’s direct evidence that that “nothing” was something after all (considering it produced something). Thus, I tend to believe that there has always been ‘something’...reality has always been here. It’s kind of creepy to contemplate.

I’ve often heard the argument that TIME began at the big bang. But I still struggle to understand this. Space and time are two sides of the same coin. It still does not follow that space/matter/energy could have been created. That simply isn’t how the laws of physics, or rather the physical design of the universe works. Matter/energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Why would that not be the case a long time ago? 

The assumption that there were no physical laws before space/time and matter/energy still doesn’t make a difference considering these laws still fully apply to space/time and matter/energy (this is a mind-bending part of the argument I still have trouble articulating to others so apologies in advance).

Perhaps I’m wrong in believing that the astrophysics community believes the universe has a beginning, but this still seems to be consensus among the general population. All I’ve understood from the science behind the Big Bang theory is that the universe was at one point incredibly dense. But there’s literally nothing to suggest it was ever created.

Time Dilation,1609638417,"Hi everyone, I am only a high school student that just discovered my interest into astrophysics and I’ve stumbled my way into time dilation, however there is just one concept I can’t seem to wrap my head around.

So using an example with two people with stopwatches: person A who is on Earth’s ground who is “stationary”, and person B who is on a spacecraft flying at say the speed of light for ease. If they both start their stopwatches simultaneously and stop them right as person B returns to Earth, from what I have researched is that person B is experiencing time at a much slower rate relative to person A and thus, returning to Earth he should find that person A has aged much more than himself (person B). However, if everything is relative using the perspective of person B he is the “stationary” one and person A and all of Earth is moving at the speed of light away from his ship and therefore time would be moving at a slower rate for person A and person A should find that person B aged much more which would cancel time dilation out. However, I know this is not the case from examples like Sergei Krikalev who came back to Earth 0.02 seconds earlier. 

I was wondering if anyone could help explain why this is, I’m guessing it has something to do with gravity bending spacetime but I’m not sure how. Also if it’s not too much to ask is there a similarity why gravity and velocity can both affect time or are they just independent from each other.

Guidance for research material?,1609510458,"Hey Guys,

im not a part of this sub, but I think i need some help on this subject...

Im currently writing an essay for my Bachelor in Audio Production Technology with a focus on converting abstract data into audio. 

My Idea for the project would be to represent the different bandwith compositions of light (excluding Infrared) on its way to earth with a Group of Oscillators, so that the final product would display the different input values over time on a spectrogram when played.

If you guys know any good literature or scientific paper I can use for my research it would really help me out a lot!

My general questions i cant really seem to find a good answer for would be:

\-Has anyone found a way to measure or simulate the different wavelength compositions of light traveling to the surface of the earth? (What im going for is taking a straight line from sun to earth and try to calculate or simulate the wavelenghts of light every  299792458 m, the audio im producing will be roughly 8 mins and 20 seconds so every second would represent one data set) 

\-Do other celestial objects create interference in the spectrum due to light reflecting off of their surface?

\-Are there any environments that light has to pass through that make light behave differently than the ""particle with no mass"" it usually behaves like?

&amp;#x200B;

Hope I could kind of explain my project to you guys, as I said i usually dont dabble in astrophysics so please excuse anything i got wrong scientifically...

What are the general costs of pursuing a degree?* I'm currently doing Bachelors in Industrial Engineering which has a lot to do with data analysis and visualization and was wondering if that would match the pre-requisites of the graduate degree. Furthermore I have a solid physics background as well since I switched to Industrial Engineering from Mechanical Engineering in Junior year (currently a senior). *Is it easy to get a good job if I were to pursue this degree?* I have read in many places that generally an astrophysicist would be doing a lot of research but other places say that even if one does not go for research, there are other job options out there including optical engineering and such.

"What happens when/if space implodes, and all that's left are black holes and there's nothing else left to ""eat""?",1609016076,"Hello there, Reddit!  


First of all, I'm just amazed by space, and by no means expert in the field, so if I said something incorrect, forgib and explain why.

This thing has been parasiting through my mind for a couple of days now, and I have to know what others think about it. So, space is obviously expanding more and more since the first moment of the Big Bang, right. Let's fast forward a bit (since I don't want this to become a monologue), and now we have planets, stars, gas clouds and so on. But what we also have, are black holes.  
Now, black holes are extremely massive objects which pull everything else into it, through spaghettification dissolve the object (once it passes the Schwarzchild radius) into one to two atoms wide soup, and slowly but surely suck it up, gain mass from it then again rinse and repeat, while floating through space and merging with other black holes. Let's take a step back for a moment, before the object/atoms/mass reach the singlularity, there's that ring called the event horizon, through which nothing can escape outwards and all roads lead to the middle. From what I understood, is that black holes have immense gravitational pull because of their sheer mass, but also once the event horizon is passed, that pull grows even more ridiculous, to a point where spacetime has no meaning at all, some suggest they even switch places.

And that is the part that interests me the most. So, if we take that as truth (gravitational pull is so strong that they (space and time) have no meaning anymore) my question would be - what happens to a black hole when/if universe implodes?  
One of mainstream theories of universe ending are implosion i.e that universe, after expanding for so long, will just turn on itself and start shrinking. But in order for something to shrink, it needs to have space to do so, over the course of time. And now, even if universe is infinitely big, once it will eat up all the space there is, all black holes will merge into one, ultra-ultra massive black hole? is that one black hole going to just exist and be... ultimate nothing in nothingness, and radiate hawking radiation for... forever? or, once singularity reaches critical point, new universe will begin out of it? or, once cosmos shrinks to level/mass lower than the black hole, it'll eat it up? Or no matter how black holes work, universe has priority and it'll just erase the black hole?  
So many posibilities, so little answers...

From Geophysics to Astrophysics,1608993752,"Hi everyone. I'm a science student in my last year of school so obviously, I'd be looking into different universities to get into. I don't have top tier grades...my grades are pretty average and I want to study Astrophysics.

 I also come from a low-income background. So my uni choices are quite narrowed, I have to choose a uni with a high acceptance rate and an affordable one as well.

So a lot of the time I'll find a uni with only a physics course (often not having an astronomy/astrophysics module) or this one that had only geophysics and somewhat affordable. Now I  just want to know if it makes sense or is possible to study geophysics in undergrad and later specialize in astrophysics or vice versa?

Query on Caustic and Critical Curves in Gravitational lensing,1608883245,"I am getting started in Gravitational lensing from a [tutorial](https://github.com/Jammy2211/autolens_workspace). I am unable to understand what critical and caustic curves are exactly?

How to Understand Time Dilation in Interstellar?,1608419585,"Hi, all. So, I decided to rewatch interstellar, but this time I wanted to understand everything that's going on in the plot. I'm really confused about how time dilation works. So, to put it into context, a day on Miller's Planet (which is located nearby a huge black hole and thus, the gravity is humungous) equals 7 years on Earth. I do not understand time dilation, but I know that time slows down at higher velocities and/or near very massive objects, i.e., the black hole in this case. My question is: does 1 day on Miller's planet ***feel*** like 7 years on Earth, or does it feel like just one day on Earth? Imagine I, being stubborn, manage to bring an Earth-calibrated clock on the planet; would a day on Miller's planet be 7 years on that clock? I know time is relative and not linear. From what I can gather, it'd still feel like an hour on Miller's planet, but still, somehow, equal 7 years on Earth? I just cannot wrap my head around this. Would I be like damn it's been forever when I spend an hour on Miller's planet, or would it seem like an ordinary hour?

Expansion of the universe,1608055200,"Layman here. I've been pondering the expansion of the universe. But my mind thinks of it as space getting smaller instead of the universe getting bigger, something that Burkhard Heim put in my head, which I thought was clever, but Heim theory is not widely supported. Still I kept thinking about it in those terms... So last week, I was thinking about the new Hubble constant being 71 +/-2km/s. But I have to ask, if mass curves space-time and we have these thing called stars that convert mass to energy, couldn't the expansion be caused by the conversion of mass to energy? We also think that the expansion is increasing, which could be attributed to additional star formation as time goes along. It would account for local variations in the ""constant"". While the density of the universe if essentially uniform, it would suggest a constant, but local variation in stellar density would be able to increase the expansion at the local level.

"Is there agreement between estimates of star sizes, populations, supernova type, and supernova frequency?",1607656233,"I was poking around in wikipedia and some of the more accessible literature, and I can't seem to square the various claims about 1) the minimum size/mass a star must be to die in a supernova, 2) the number of these stars there are in our galaxy and other galaxies, 3) the average lifespan of these stars, and 4) the (in)frequency with which supernova are actually observed.

Basically, the internet says there are millions of giant and supergiant stars in our galaxy alone, and that they only live 10-100 million years, and that they all die in supernova.

But if that were true, we would expect to see multiple supernova every year in our galaxy alone. Instead, they occur only once every few centuries.

THEORY.,1607431192,"Hey guys so if there's any astrophysicists out there I have a theory (not sure if it's been talked about but i haven't seen anything and would love your opinions).

Is there a possibility we live in a Black Hole. We know the first star (and evidence of light) wasn't born until 100 million years after the Big Bang. Humans are only 6000 years old and astrophysics wasn't until 000s of years later.
            We know Back Holes suck in and crush planets and stars, so once crushes all that would be left are gasses, atoms etc. Which would then take 100 million years to form a star and that's why no light escapes a Black Hole because there are no stars formed to be observed (or maybe to many light-years away to be seen) and by the time light WOULD be visible millions of years on earth would have passed, making the possibility there have been years passed since light was visible from a black hole making it blend in to our ""seeable"" universe.
                                                  Some places on earth have rivers within the sea which scientist are trying to understand and given that space is more confusing than earth itself that's how Black Holes are within a Black Hole?

Introduction to the world of Astrophysics,1606851010,"Hey guys, I’m a senior in college studying Industrial Engineering. After what seems like my whole life, I recently got into the world of astrophysics. That being said, ever since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by space and the understanding the mechanics of it. After several drug induced trips to higher levels of consciousness, followed by lengthy exploration of youtube videos about understanding higher dimensions and other mysteries of the cosmos (string theories, black holes etc.) I have found a love for astrophysics like never before. I also have to mention, I have a good basic understanding of physics (took 200 level courses in college before I changed from Mechanical Engineering to Industrial). I have also studied physics in Alevels (both AS and A2, achieved A*)(For those familiar with the Cambridge System of education.) So I had a few questions since I’m a little bit overwhelmed (and lost?) about where to begin. 

1) Where can I find a solid resource that will help me start from the basics of Astrophysics? By that I mean is it even possible to get university level organized courses (or their content) online without having to go through university? 

2) If there are any astrophysicists out there that could potentially take me under their wing? I’m willing to learn and absorb as much as I can. I will help you for free, I’ll write your emails! Just give me a chance to dive into the world of Astrophysics. 

I know currently I’m an Industrial Engineering student and I’m going to complete my bachelors in IE in about a year (December 2021) I don’t really know where I’m going in my life, but for the first time I feel so gravitated toward something. People will say oh it’s just a phase and I will get overwhelmed for whatnot. I know this was a lot, I just want to be a pioneer into understanding newer dimensions.

Geosynchronous orbits doubt,1606848264,"Was reading up on geosynchronous orbits, and how all their semi major axis are equal to the radius of a geostationary orbit, which is a circle in the equatorial plane of earth that has orbital angular velocity equal to Earth's.

I couldn't understand what this exactly means. By Kepler's second law, equal amounts of area are swept out by a satellite in equal amounts of time.

"Antimatter Galaxies, Expanding Universe?",1606574460,"From what I understand, antimatter interacts with other antimatter in a way that's identical to how matter interacts with matter, but both are thought to emit the same electromagnetic radiation. It's also theorized mathematically that antimatter has a positive gravitational force relationship with other antimatter, but an anti-gravity force relationship with matter.

Is it possible that the expanding universe is the result of more-or-less evenly interspersed matter and anti-matter galaxies with attractive gravitational forces between like galaxies and repulsive gravitational forces between ""opposing"" galaxies? It's not like we'd be able to tell by looking that an anti-matter galaxy is actually antimatter...

Also, wouldn't this imply that 1: either the accelerating expansion of the universe is some kind of cosmic perpetual motion machine, or 2: the acceleration at the outer-edge of the universe is momentum balanced by a kind of anti-gravity pressure inwards, which more reflects almost wave-like ripples in the ""galaxy density"" of the universe—thinning at the edges and condensing near the center.

Light From Black Holes,1606452595,"Hi, let me begin by saying that I'm not the smartest person out there. I've read several books on astrophysics and cosmology and quantum physics and find it all fascinating. I (think I) remember reading at one time that if we were to watch someone approach a black hole we would see them slow down as they got nearer to the event horizon, because the gravity gets stronger the closer they get it slows the light we see coming from the objects approaching it. As they cross the event horizon we would see them stop completely as the light is no longer travelling towards us. Have I picked this up incorrectly?   
If I have then that is all okay.  
If I have not then can someone explain why black holes aren't bright? Why don't we see the last frozen images of light from stars that have been devoured?

I'm actually trying to learn how to calculate the rotational velocity of galaxies (Milky Way in particular) and I'm a bit clueless :(

1. How does the most basic angular velocity equation compare to calculating the angular velocity of the Milky Way galaxy?
2. Are the calculations of all galaxies similar (same physics, same process of solving, same equation)?
3. How does dark matter affect the calculation? Or does the angular velocity stay the same with the effect of dark matter on the rotation? I would assume that dark matter would cause a certain star to rotate faster at some points, but is this completely wrong?
4. When calculating the rotational velocity of the Milky Way galaxy, are we looking at the movement of one star close to the center or at the edge of the galaxy? Does the angular velocity of the star's rotation stay consistent throughout?
5. How do we know the size of the galaxy and the movements of a star within the galaxy?

My Theory on the Cosmic Nature of the Universe(Opinion Post),1606017191,"I must quickly confess that my understanding of astronomy is barely above laymen, in a professional sense.
While I have always been fascinated by astronomy and astrophysics, I do not claim to be an authority on the topic.

That being said, I would like to put forward what I believe is the nature of the cosmic medium. 

Please take it with a pinch of salt.

The Cosmic Foam, or Infinite Bubble Multiverse hypothesis(couldn't decide on a name for it lol) is that basically, the big bag is one of many infinitely existing, infinitely occuring big bang events, existing in spacetime alongside many Big Crunch events, in which the big bangs meet each other in the middle, so to speak, and coalesce until gaining the incredible amount of mass required to go hypercritical, triggering another big bang.

The hypothesis is that this event and an infinite number of similar events are constantly happening across inifite spacetime, like a giant megacosmic foam, bubbles bursting and joing then expanding and bursting again.

So there is an infinite universe, and many ""multiverses""(for want of a better name) that occur simultaneously within the same vast expanse of spacetime, not hidden in higher planes or alternate dimensions, but simply spread across mind-bending distances.

And that's pretty much my idea of what the greater universe might be like.

Wondering about an Idea I had recently regarding Plank Length and Black Hole mergers.,1605884370,"So, I am no Physicist but I love the subjekt and read up on it as a hobby. And so when I get ideas they may very well be bogus, so be advised. But I never have heard or seen this discussed anywhere so I post it here to get a bit of response.

So first of all, it concerns Black Holes merging, and the paradox it shuld create.
The buisness end, the singularety inside the event horizon is supposed to be a one dimensional point of infinite densety in space time. Now, here comes the paradox. How are two sigulareties meant to merge? Because if they are a singular point with just one dimension, they shuld not be able to. They shuld just near each other for all eternity and never meet, as the distance between two one dimensional points is always infinite.

Now, th Plank Length seems to be more and more likely to be an actual thing. Which would maybe offer a explanation. Because if you go beneath the plank length, space and time stop making sense and the laws of physics do not really adhere. 

So, if the two singularitys approach nearer than the plank length, and normal distance stops being a thing, could that sove the paradox?
Basically the singularitys getting so close the universe “glitches out”.",astrophysics,Reep1611,/r/astrophysics/comments/jxqico/wondering_about_an_idea_i_had_recently_regarding/,4

Start of humans and black holes theory,1605679760,"So I have a couple ideas that I want to bounce off people about the start of humans and black holes. 

Disclaimer: I know extremely little. I’ve taken a introductory to black holes course by my local university (10 weeks and certificate woo) and I’m just learning about biology. 

Phew that’s out of the way. So from what I’ve been reading humans split from chimpanzees about 5 million years ago. Cygnus x-1 is also 5 million years ago. 

Theory one: when Cygnus x-1 formed did it cause a gravitational wave that assisted in humans splitting from chimpanzees?

Theory two: were the jets from Cygnus x-1 pointed towards earth and increasing our chances of splitting from chimpanzees? Maybe the jets carried x ray particles, ultraviolet maybe?

I don’t know if this has any connection whatsoever but it’s a nagging thing in my brain that I would like to share and bounce off you much more talented than me people.

Do we observe stellar processes happening at different rates due to time dialation?,1605037937,"I imagine this is the right place to ask. My background is in astro engineering so I've never delved into these areas, but I was thinking about time dilation, and how time must flow differently closer to the center of our galaxy than it does on the outer edges (relative to us, of course). First of all, I'm not even sure this premise is totally accurate, but I remember learning that's how time dilation works as you approach a large source of mass. 

If that is the case, can we expect to see star formation/decay happen very slowly if we look in one direction, toward the center of a galaxy, then see it happen much quicker if we look in a different direction, even if the physical process is the same one? I hope that question makes sense... 

Also, doesn't size dilate too? Can stars appear larger than they are in certain places? I hope somebody can stop me from way overthinking things because my mind is just so boggled right now.",astrophysics,RaspberryNext,/r/astrophysics/comments/jrs4lz/do_we_observe_stellar_processes_happening_at/,4

I am not a physicist or even well-read but this has been bugging me.,1604786419,"Ok, so. I haven't done any science of any kind in 3 years, but I know (vaguely) that particles of dust and gas are floating about in space, and that's how stars and planets are formed, but it's gotten me thinking.

Ok so for context, my friend and I yesterday were talking about nebulae and we googled their purpose and there was a general explanation of how the particles come into contact and then the more join and there's a gravitational pull and then boom ignition and a star!!

But then, if space is infinite, and there's a limited amount of gas and dust particles in space (logically, I assume this, but correct me if I'm wrong), isn't it the nature of at least gas particles to float and disperse evenly throughout (for example) a container? So if space is infinite, then these particles should never come into contact with each other in the first place. So that must mean that there is an end to space, and that allows the particles to kind of bounce off the ""barriers"" around space and into each other, thus creating celestial bodies.

Does this make sense? I would have googled this but it seemed such a niche question that I doubt I would've found the specific answer. Also, this isn't me trolling, this is a Genuine question.

Possibly Dumb Redshift Question!,1604688560,"I had a shower thought this morning regarding expansion/redshift, and this seemed like it might be the right place to share it.

I was reading this article when it struck me (not needed to understand the post): [https://scitechdaily.com/first-ever-large-survey-of-distant-galaxies-yields-surprises-for-astrophysicists/](https://scitechdaily.com/first-ever-large-survey-of-distant-galaxies-yields-surprises-for-astrophysicists/)

This isn't the first case where we look toward the edge of the visible universe and find structures that are more mature than we expect.

To the thought - what if redshift is not an artifact of expansion, but instead an artifact of time slowing over trillions of years?  If I were to transmit light on a given frequency - if the rate of change of time in the universe goes DOWN, then the apparent frequency of the traveling light will also shift down linearly, preserving the spectrum contained within that light, whereas newly transmitted light will be using the current rate of time, and would appear as expected.  This could also potentially explain things like inflation, where things seemed to happen faster than current physics as we understand it would allow.

I can only imagine that there is research already being done in this direction, or that there are already people working on how you can measure the rate of time and whether it changes from within our time-based existence.  I'm just a humble EE, so what I'm looking for are references and direction so I can feed this crazy thought of mine with the work of people much smarter than I am :)",astrophysics,Kindred192,/r/astrophysics/comments/jpavew/possibly_dumb_redshift_question/,7

Hello women in Astrophysics!,1604489738,"Hi!

I am a college student studying Astrophysics and Computer Science. I am also a woman. For the longest time I was interested in Astrophysics but never thought I would study it. I just never thought that I was smart enough. I thought I was smart and excelled in math and science, but for some reason I never thought I could be successful in this field. 

Eventually, because I really enjoyed learning about space I stumbled across a podcast of where actual astrophysicists (and people in related fields) talk about what they study and their research. The host is a woman, and many of the people that went on their show were also women. This was the first time I really saw, or heard rather, someone like me in Astrophysics. I didn’t realize how much I needed to see myself and relate to astrophysics to believe I could be successful in this field and pursue something I genuinely love.

So this is want I want to ask to any women in Astrophysics (or any STEM field really):

"Spacetime thought experiment, is it possible?",1604413431,"I was listening to a podcast the other day on black holes while I was jogging and I think my runners high helped me imagine this idea and I wanted to to see what people smarter about this stuff than me thought of it.  

So our universe is 3 spatial demensions and 1 time demension.   We move through space and space also moves through time.  What if gravity was just the friction of objects in the spatial demension being dragged through time.  So basically the larger the object the more drag it had which would correlate to a deeper gravity well but it would also explain what time seemed to slow down because everything in that objects gravity well would being dragged behind things with less gravity.  

Could this also explain how as you get closer to a black hole time slows more and more as or gets dragged further and further behind by the friction of time.  The singularity of the black hole is actually where the drag becomes so strong it pops a whole in the time demension.  

So Entering a black hole would be like popping through the time demension so you actually go outside of time and that is why the whole past and future are displayed around you.   

I’m not sure this makes total sense.  I’m trying to wrap my head around it.  I tried to make a 3D model on my computer but I don’t have the right skills.  I’d love to hear what people think of this thing.  I had fun dreaming it up.",astrophysics,rmurphe,/r/astrophysics/comments/jnb469/spacetime_thought_experiment_is_it_possible/,14

Wormholes and Negative mass - Creative project,1603743042,"Hello all! 

I'm a creative writer and looking for some help on an idea for my project. I'm trying to achieve a few things: 

I am looking to have a character contact another character in another dimension, and would like radio waves to travel through a wormhole. I'd like the wormhole to be discovered after negative mass has been proven to exist. 

I am wondering how I can get from the discovery of negative mass, to the discovery of said wormhole. What I'm bumping up against is that these discoveries imply that negative mass and wormholes pre-exist the discoveries, and it's just that now we would know how to test them. 

I'm wondering if there is a way for negative mass to be discovered (presumably by observing a flaw in general relativity), and *then* for some reason, a wormhole comes into existence. What would be a way for a wormhole to form, not too far from earth? And could this event somehow be related to what led our fictional scientists to be able to prove negative mass?

Even tidally-locked, these massive planets can catch an induced magnetosphere, but I've also had the idea that a Superearth with a Uranus-like tilt and spin could cause an intrinsic magnetosphere and really wild days/seasons/habitable bands.

Ok so I posted a question regarding dark matter and dark energy a few days ago.,1602627758,"I got a bunch of people helping me understand how the effects of gravity and how the ideas of dark energy and dark matter arose. One, thank you, it was super informative. Two, a new thought popped in my head. Given that we dont really understand what causes gravity, but we know gravity is a property of mass, could it be possible that gravity is inherently also a property  or energy? E/c^2= m, meaning effectively that E = m (i know thats not how math works but i think you get it). If mass is so closely telated to energy it seems to me plausible that a property of mass (gravity) would also apply to energy. Also could dark energy and dark matter be the same thing just disguised as two different features of the observable universe? Im sure my thinking is flawed here so please explain where im thinking wrong.

Time dilation between parallel universes,1602612165,"Let’s assume we have two identical universes A and B. They have identical histories, and for all intents and purposes are clones of each other. The only difference is the point in time in which they exist. Let’s say that universe A is at a point in time 95 million years ahead of universe B. Let’s also assume they were “born” at exactly the same point in “time.” The reason universe B is 95 million years “younger” is because its time moves more slowly compared to universe A.

So... with that being said, what is an equation to figure out how much faster time is moving for universe A relative to universe B?

I was thinking if we assume that universe A is 13.77 billion years old, then universe B would be 95 million years, or 1.007 times “younger” at 13.675 billion years old. Would this mean that time moves 1.007 times faster for A than for B and therefore on a scale of days or a few years that this time dilation is negligible to an observer in either universe? Or is it more extreme and my calculation is incorrect?

Is this science or not?,1602467741,"The concept is simple and overwhelming.

There exists many solar bodies in the universe, but let's focus just on our solar system.

Now, there are a bunch of science things happening at all times to all things. Waves, erosion, force, etc. There is a miasma of a cauldron similar to just looking at the sun. It seems like a volcanic eruption but it's all scientifically traced back, purportedly.

So the major and minor forces are an orchestral wave in the ocean of life and our solar system. Everything pulling on everything, as it spirals out into wherever. The centrifugal pull of Jupiter having such a remote pull on the weather patterns of earth, but an absolute and always and consistent effect, and the same with everything else. With brain waves, and emotions and decisions and patterns and behaviors.

The spiderweb of things physically flowing in their direction causing stimuli that is then accepted by whatever host accepts and reciprocates it. And that beautiful dance is a specific track with major and minor players. More forces become more impactful when squeezed by that which squeezed them before and was destined on a track back to the first nothing of the big bang.

The sprawl out of everything and the coalescence in extremely complicated patterns that aren't recorded but are absolutely happening and measurable. Determinism with a slight adjustment.

The adjustment being that there exists the idea to push against the forces that push against you. That free will exists, that you push back, but the overwhelming forces and tracks push back and push everything else you push to shift and shape the form of things back to where it should be.

So changes can happen, though rarely, but mostly everything follows a predictable pattern except for when they don't.

This is an area where we don't say ""it's a negligible amount of pull"". I don't want to hear that .0000045% pull of a gravity on someone's body somewhere doesn't have a result because it absolutely does and is absolutely played out just not quantified and calculated because of the chaos of variables and the extreme inability to track the flow of the river while on it, on a raft, riding the river, while it flows, trying to figure it out.

Does this make any sort of sense? Everything has a purpose and everything does a thing we just don't notice what it does, and we go with the flow and the flow started a long long time ago.

But we see patterns and we see things flow naturally so... is the idea so strange?

Gravity/HEP Theory Reading Club (UF) -- Season 2,1602212767,"Hi All,

I am a graduate student in the University of Florida. Several of our students in HEP theory and astrophysics have established a reading club, and we are glad to invite you all.

We have established two separate reading groups by now: Tuesday for high energy, and Thursday for gravity. On Thursday we are currently reading *Quantum Gravity* by Carlo Rovelli. (A very difficult book, though.) We are planning broader and more accessible events to attract more students. 

I believe it is a good time to invite you all and form a general meeting to hear from those interested.

Let me briefly explain our club's idea:

* Motivation: To read more advanced theory textbooks (graduate level).
* Format: ""The Lyceum method"" -- that everyone read the same chapter beforehand, one student presents the major content, and the other students ask questions.
* Multimedia: We are planning to review lecture videos rather than only textbooks to boost efficiency.
* Time: Currently at dusk around 6PM EDT.

Stars as massive ion thrusters?,1602076276,"I can only assume this is an unoriginal thought but I thought this would be the best place to ask it. With the expanding universe, as the aggregate mass of all of the matter in the universe moves away from the universal origin and the gravitational field weakens it makes sense that everything would speed up as things spread out. But after that the increase of speed seems odd. Thus we enter into the realm of dark energy. The question I have is this, that at the galactic scale could/do stars/star clusters act as ion thrusters in relation to the surrounding galaxies? Cells in circulation have a similar phenomenon called the zeta potential. Would it follow that over the large area the network of black holes act to keep galaxies together while the stars are constantly emitting particles and where the gravitational forces are weaker on a galactic scale there is thrust? Would that account for the planar geometry of galactic disks? I know to the the professionals this must seem idiotic as hell and is most likely showing off my ignorance.

Need help making a model of orbits.,1602062813,"Hey Astrophysicists,

TLDR; Please help me make an Excel model simulating the orbit of a planet around the sun.

&amp;#x200B;

For school I want to make a model in Excel that simulates the orbits of planets around the sun. I don't really know where to start. 

I want to make a model that shows the orbit of a planet around the sun. I want the sun in the middle of the model with any random given planet orbiting around it. I'd also like to implement a feature where one could fill in random values for the relevant factors for an orbit and see what that orbit would look like. Basically a simulation for non-existing planets.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is, I know there are a handful of factors that determine the orbit of a planet. But I don't know all of them, I'd greatly appreciate anyone who is willing to list and explain the relevant factors.

I also don't know where I should start when making the model. I haven't found an equation for the orbit around the sun and I don't know if there even is one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any help and I'm looking forward to your answers.

"Okay HEAR ME OUT, on my ideas of black holes and space-time.",1601881580,"  

HERES THE THING. I’m kind of retarded. Not really, but I’ve been doing a lot of (uneducated) thinking about how the universe, gravity, space and time, and black holes, relate to one another. I’m more or less asking about this ‘plausible’ (to me, In my mind) idea I’ve had recently. Because of my lack of real education on these extremely complicated and abstract matters of the universe, I really don’t even know where I’d find evidence or a lack there-of to support or refute my theoretical hypothesis of how black holes relate to the rest of our universe, and I’m hoping for some educated feedback on whether these ideas are baseless and dumb, and why. I just want to further my understanding of the subject and need a bit of help. Fair warning, I re-explain my ideas a bit in different ways, more than once, because I suck at communicating their abstract nature and want people to understand what I'm trying to get across. I also probably use some big words incorrectly. Whatever. Help a brother out.

Is it possible that the reason we have an edge to the observable universe, is the same reason why we are entirely unable to observe a black hole? is it possible that a black hole is simply a breakdown of a point in our universe where we would inevitably be viewing ourselves, which is not possible due to the dimension of time, and the same particle is already being observed from a different location. Thinking of this as a black hole containing everything that is our universe, and that every black hole contains our universe, we can no sooner observe the inside of it because of its relationship with the universe as we perceive it around us. I postulate that if we were to travel to the outside edge of our universe that we would find ourselves returned to the universe in the same way, just passing through a warp in our perception of 3D space. 

I postulate, that, conversely, if we were to travel to, say the edge of a black hole, then move into it, every point past the observable edge we travel is stretching and stretching like a hole within itself, and if you continue to keep going, it would reveal the universe itself again, and if you kept moving in the exact same direction forever and ever, eventually you would return to the same point in 3D space where you were going to enter that specific black hole. Could this not also indicate a Space-Time relationship and have a relative gravity relationship. 

To better explain this ridiculous idea of mine, this would help to visualize a straw. A straw is finite, measurable, and easy to think of. Now if you took that straw, bent it around in a circle, and fused the two ends together, you COULD travel in one direction, forever, and never meet an END, but the space itself is finite and measurable, however the shape is perceivable in different ways, the same way you would perceive 2 dimensional space from our 3rd dimension. So if you had a like, BIG straw, and existed within that straw as a 2 dimensional person, and walked inside it from one end all the way across the long edge and kept going, you’d eventually see an end, RIGHT? Like you cant just see more straw or anything, its just an end. However if you had the straw in a loop attached to itself, it’s size never really changes but you’d just keep walking forever and ever and keep returning from whence you came. My thought process is that the relationship of the straw and the 2 dimensional person is possibly similar to our 3 dimensional selves and the way we see our universe. And that from a 3 dimensional perspective, looking at the looped straw makes perfect sense, but to the 2 dimensional person it would be beyond baffling.

Back to the black hole. So, it’s believed that time dilates around a black hole, similar to how it’s shown in the movie interstellar. Could it not be possible that a black hole is just a breakdown in the way space and time relate to each other, or at least a fundamental change in their interaction?

Like how if you traveled through a black hole, the distance you could travel in the same amount of time changes, and you loop back on the universe. Am I making any sense? Essentially to my new understanding, the way I view a black hole is simply a (CRINGE) ‘wormhole’, of the universe looping back on itself, and the reason we can’t see inside is the EXACT same reason we have a finite distance that we can observe in the universe, and if we traveled in a straight line in one vector from earth forever, like a LONG fucking time, we would eventually loop back to earth through a black hole that we would never even perceive. 

This could also be a way of explaining the universe as a kind of ebb and flow, and the reason gravity exists is simply the universe keeping a relationship with itself? For instance, when we think of black holes as “consuming” things caught within its gravity, could that technically just be a movement of the universe back into itself, and instead of it being “consumed” into an infinitely smaller and smaller, denser speck of unescapable dense matter, time dilates conversely, and it’s merely moved through time instead of space, and because the same matter can’t be observed twice at the same time, if we knew how the shape of the universe looked, could we then pinpoint where that matter went, at the edge of the observable universe?

For instance, say we watched a planet become consumed by a black hole, it’s no longer observable because light does not travel from that space anymore. If we knew the shape of it’s ‘pocket’ we could determine where in the edge of our observable universe that planet is now observable at, maybe?

Another way I've thought of this is the way black holes technically exist, is that matter has become so dense that the gravity of it does not let the light escape, hence it is unobservable. Is it possible to think that because space in that finite speck has become so densely packed and focused that time itself warps and expands relative to the lack of space? and then to think that the relationship of space and time within the black hole inverts, thus technically expanding time so far as to loop back upon itself? 

Anyways, bottom line is I’m retarded suck at explaining my own abstract thoughts and ideas, and need some help from people who can grasp what I’m talking about and tell me JUST HOW DUMB I really am.

I have a theory.,1601441652,"(Pls don't steal, I'd be sad. Im not old enough for college and a stolen theory couldn't be my thesis)

I don't care if you repost just please, mention my name.

          Black holes. These illusive giants have made me wonder for years. Some people believe that black holes are just portals to different universes, and that lets them fall asleep at night. I wanted to know the truth.

For years I've wondered what they could be, some sort of dark matter or even better a warp tunnel? No, those are just flat out illogical. I do agree some may have some support but they are mostly false for all we know.

Today I was chilling playing chess with my dad, when it just clicked.

Black holes aren't some kind of obscure matter, but rather a new element or combination of a few to make a hyper dense lattice. Supernovas have so much pressure that it's at the brink of impossible to recreate in lab settings. Furthermore we haven't ever been in or close enough to a black hole to observe what's inside. Supernovas have the power to create as much as they destroy.

My theory is simple. It is and only is that a black hole is a hyper dense core with gravity so strong that light cant escape, not some random portal or mysterious warp tunnel. A solid object that collects mass.

How do gravitational waves couple their energy?,1601277976,"So, I've been watching a lot of astrophysics videos on youtube recently.  I had a question come up in my head that I can't seem to wrap my brain around completely.  I'll state my train of thought, so it can be pointed out if I'm making any incorrect assumptions anywhere.

1) Neutron stars/black holes in binary orbits lose energy, which brings them closer together, this energy radiates away as gravitational waves.

2) The amount of energy ""lost"" to the system can be measured in whole solar masses.  -- Which is an absolutely ridiculous amount of energy.

This is where I get a bit confused, and have a few questions.

Q1) I was under the impression that energy itself was the cause of gravity.  How can we radiate away mass as energy?  Does this mean that other masses can radiate away their mass over time through similar means?

Q1-B) Are the gravitational waves stronger than the normal gravity of the system?

Q1-C) Can the gravitational waves ""push"" at all?  Or is it all pull?

Q2) How do gravitational waves interact?  Lets say we have a binary system that is going through a combination event among a homogenous cloud of gas that spans lightyears in all directions.  What happens to that gas?

Q2-B) Lets say we have a combination event at the distance of the sun.  What happens to earth?  What happens to Jupiter?  What happens to Proxima Centari?

Question about the Expansion of Space,1601145660,"I was wondering about how far away something would have to be for the expansion of space between us and it to prevent its light from ever reaching us.

Converting into light years gives 13.96 billion light years. Which is very close to the currently agreed upon age of the universe.

This was very exciting to discover naturally, but I was wondering if this is well known, or even if this is what the age of the universe (observable universe?) is derived from?",astrophysics,ZGorlock,/r/astrophysics/comments/j0bbvo/question_about_the_expansion_of_space/,6

Does energy lost to gravity waves make space viscous?,1601104782,"Probably dumb question from lay person...

So we now know that black holes and/or neutron stars send out gravity waves as they spiral into each other.  More over their orbits around each other decay because of the energy lost in those waves.

So does that mean that any mass moving through space needs energy to warp/bend space time?   Albeit a tiny amount compare to the massive weight and high speeds of those spinning collapsed stars.

If that's true, doesn't that mean that space if viscous and things moving through it will slow down?

What about photons that are massless? Well for this they are not really massless. A space ship carrying Schrodinger's car in a box won't suddenly accelerate faster because the box weighs less if the radiative trigger decays and emits a photon that is contained within the box (of mirrors).

Is this the theory of lazy light? It light is red shifted because it slows rather than the universe expands?

So I'm pretty sure I'm missing something fundamental here... But the whole explanation of gravity waves just makes me think that space must be ""viscous"" in that it takes energy to move through it?? Or is warping space time done for free for everything but black holes?",astrophysics,sfigone,/r/astrophysics/comments/j01kqp/does_energy_lost_to_gravity_waves_make_space/,3

Would it be a bad decision to start a PhD next fall?,1600968173,"I have known for a while that permanent jobs in astrophysics are competitive.

This person graduated from a strong PhD program, is on his second NSF-funded postdoc, and has decided the job market is too competitive for him.

Then I  remember that I actually have no ambition to compete for tenure-track jobs or do the postdoc shuffle. I want to get a job at a national lab or observatory, where the postdoc is often a probationary period that leads to full-time hire, or maybe a simulation/engineering job in the space industry.

After all most of what we know about the universe is based on what we can see based on the light we can see therefore was there something here before light came to be?

Are black holes different universes?,1599866297,"I feel like it's easy to relates the questions and uncertainties of the big bang to those of a black hole.  
It would be 'easy' to think of the big bang as of a white hole kind of thing. I've got the intuition that this is wrong, and I would like people to confirm it's wrong and tell me why.

I'm thinking black holes keep on existing in our universe, which would contradict this belief of the big bang being a white hole, because we'd be seeing 'matter' coming in 'forever' from the black hole in the preceding universe getting bigger. Which we don't, right? Unless it's always at the very edges and we can't observe it. Then again, time in the 'old' universe could be different from time in our 'new' universe and so maybe the 'slow' expansion of our universe could be explained by black hole 'eating' matter in a relatively 'small' amount of time in the preceding universe. Maybe time gets slower and slower the deeper you get into universes created by blackholes? Because they get denser and denser and the passage of time depends on the density of matter, denser things would be 'experiencing' more time?  
Also, what if our universe is expanding BECAUSE the black hole in the preceding universe is getting more and more matter. So the rate of expansion of our universe could depend on the rate at which matter falls into the preceding universe's black hole.  
That would suggest an infinity of universe though, and an eventually slowing rate of expansion when the black hole has 'eaten' all the matter close by. It would suggest a dynamic rate of expansion. Which we don't see right? It's a constant expansion, right?  
As I understand it, expansion is more of a dilution than an addition, else we'd be able to see and differentiate the 'new' space from the 'old' space, right?

Is there an hypothesis on what cause the Big Bang?,1599524302,"Hi there!  
I was just watching a Brian Greene video, and I got a question about the origin of the Big Bang and the second law of thermodynamics.

As I understand it , the Big Bang (the original singularity, pre-inflation) is the precise origin of space-time. That's why the question ""what was before the Big Bang?"" is absurd by default, there was no before.

The second law of thermodynamics is what defines the arrow of time and how energy dissipates in an increasing manner. Therefore entropy on a macro scale can only increase over time.  


With that said, what could cause the Big Bang, if there was no time? No temperature, no quantum fields, no nothing. If nothing could ""move"" or change energy states, in any way, how could the process begin?

Will we ever travel faster than light?,1599441268,"I don't mean actually traveling faster than light (thanks Einstein), I mean doing so through roundabout ways such as the Alcubierre warp drive.

As time goes on, it feels like any roundabout way we think of just creates more problems than they solve. For example, both wormholes and the Alcubierre drive require matter with negative mass to function properly. That just seems to break all logic.

Now, I do know that science like this isn't even in it's infancy, yet. Hell Einstein thought he was crazy when he thought up of black holes......but yet, we happened to take the first picture of one just last year. We have ALOT to learn, and something new could come about at any time.

But I can't shake that feeling that what we need to overcome is truthfully impossible. The Fermi Paradox presents us with ""The Great Filter"", a hypothesis that tries to explain why we have yet to see any extraterrestrial life. And it ranges from nuclear war to life just starting out in general. But, one Great Filter proposal that I have yet to see from anyone.....is the speed of light.

Velocity and it’s affect on time...,1598847237,"So, according to special relativity, as you move faster time slows down. And as we humans live out our existence on Earth we are constantly traveling through space at mind blowing speeds.

Depending on where on Earth you are standing you are traveling up to approximately 1000mph as a result of the Earth’s rotation.

As Earth orbits the Sun we are traveling at approximately 67,000mph.

And the Earth is being towed along by the Sun as it orbits the super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way moving at a speed of approximately 515,000mph.

About a few weeks previous to Hale Bopp, the news broadcasted by radio was that the comment should appear soon &amp; it was a big deal, so everybody was very excited about it, since nothing ever happened in my city. 
But we were living in an extremely rural and poor area so we didn't know how this stuff worked, we ended up watching the skies for over a week and idk if we even saw it. However we saw something very interesting and I'm looking answers for what it could be.

Around that part where you can see the milky way, we saw a bright spot that had some yellow then turned into a greenish circle with very bright borders and then started to fade, however it wasn't in motion like you'd expect a comet, I know I wasn't just tripping because all the residents nearby where looking commenting on it in complete amazement.

So the question is, what could we possibly have sent in the sky, that looked like a green explosion of sorts? Could it be another comet? Was it something in the further up layers of atmosphere?

I'm no a physicist, I've just been living with this question since 1997 so I'm asking for help.  

Some background info.

The night was incredibly dark because I lived in the middle of the nowhere. Houses barely had a 1 filament light bulb in the entire house, power outages were common and we could see a the milky way and way more stars than you'd see in a city.

"Astronomy major as a ""hobby""",1598639736,"I have the opportunity, through work, to attend any accredited university for free and choose any major I want. The program I end up choosing has no impact on my career (air force pilot), the only requirement is that I have a university degree. Period. In other words, my performance in the program of my choosing in no way impacts my career since the degree itself won't be used after I graduate. 

That being said, I've always had an interest in astronomy, and if I can get a deeper understanding of it for free I'd love to do that. During high school I took no math/science related courses. I just scraped by. I'm now 25 and embarking on an ""academic upgrading"" journey in order to meet all prerequisites. However, I'm not sure yet if I have the scientific and mathematical inclination required to pursue that field of study. 

My questions:
1. Is there such a thing as scientific and mathematical inclination? Is it required to pursue that field of study? Or is hard work all that's needed?
2. Is astronomy simply too hard a subject to pursue if I'm coming at it from a ""hobby"" perspective? 

I know I could instead pursue other ""easier"" programs and take introductory astronomy courses to satisfy that desire, but I really have a strong interest in learning as much as I can about astronomy, not just the basics.

It’s not necessarily an ‘attraction’ but the smaller object being trapped in a space-time groove caused by adjacent and larger objects in the spacetime fabric. The constant effect of the larger, adjacent objects on spacetime keeps the object perpetually in orbital motion.

Trying to understand curved space-time and geometry,1598112675,"Hi, I'm trying to understand the interaction between mass curving space-time and Euclidean geometry. My background is mechanics and electrophysics in college for my comp sci degree, and an enthusiastic layperson for relativity and astrophysics. I've watched a lot of PBS space-time on YouTube. 
So here's what has me stumped. Euclidean 2D geometry works in a flat plane. But in the gravity well of earth, space-time is curved. Don't recall if mass creates positive or negative curvature. But if curvature is positive, the 2D plane becomes effectively spherical, in which case the circumference of a circle would be shorter than its radius would give in a flat plane. If curvature is negative, the plane becomes saddle like, and the circumference of a circle becomes longer than the radios gives on a flat plane.
Am I good so far?
So, does mass curved space-time affect geometry as I mentioned, or am I misunderstanding something? My current reasoning is that it does, but the curvature is so small that a 2D plane still appears flat mathematically, much like the earth appears flat because the curve is too gradual to detect without precision instruments. But this leads to black holes, which curve space-time to the breaking point. As you approach the event horizon, does increasing positive curvature start crushing you? Or increasing negative curvature start tearing? If you have a metal disc created outside any gravity well in flat space-time, what happens to it as it approaches the event horizon? It seems like positive curvature would crush it, as it would have a longer circumference than fits in the increasingly curved space, or it would tear as its circumference isn't enough in increasingly negative curved space.
None of the simplified for a layperson books or videos I've seen touch on this at all. So have I wildly misunderstood something? Or am I on the right track and this has just been left out of what I've seen for simplicity?

What is the optimal velocity to enter a powered gravity assist?,1597876474,"I was wondering about the concept of powered gravity assists where a spacecraft burns fuel at periapsis during an assist to further take advantage of the Oberth effect. So say i had a spacecraft trying to leave the solar system and so it did an assist with Jupiter and also applied thrust, making it a powered flyby. How would you find the optimal velocity that this spacecraft should enter the assist with? Because it is generally more efficient to approach a gravity assist with a slower speed so you spend more time under the influence, but then for the Oberth effect it is also always better to thrust at a higher speed because you would gain the most extra kinetic energy (E = Fd and a faster speed would mean you are covering a greater distance for a given time). So how do we decide which manoeuvre to prioritize for the velocity into the assist? - is one more effective than the other?",astrophysics,aaivanov,/r/astrophysics/comments/icy3in/what_is_the_optimal_velocity_to_enter_a_powered/,7

There is this generational Oneill cylinder that has to travel for 270 ly and at his faster, it will reach .75% the speed of light and the travel all together will have to be at his maximum 600 years.

Plus I'll need to know in case they decide to use the gravity of neutron star (that will be way after the point of no return) to invert their route and come back to Earth how long will be the acceleration-deceleration? (In this case, the journey will be longer than 600 years probably double.

I live in Canada and there doesn’t seem to be many jobs for a astrophysicist but I’m sure there’s more than what I see I’m just not sure where to look. Or does this depend more on what specialization you choose for your masters? 

Also how many that have a career as an astrophysicist do it full time and how many split time between that and teaching?

Probability of detecting alien communication,1597173737,"Hi all,

I'm unsure if this is a good place to post, but I am completing a part time MSc in Astrophysics, and the title of this thread is the title of my project. Although following the supervisors guidance I have read through a couple of academic journals and also some of the references. 

I am wondering if anyone has some experience of good books/studies to do with SETI? 

Although the parameters used in simulations are a challenge to find, one thing I find interesting also is: what can we infer from the fact we have not yet detected alien communication?

Has anyone here done any studies in this area? Many thanks in advance of responses!",astrophysics,mjkirk2,/r/astrophysics/comments/i7y6ne/probability_of_detecting_alien_communication/,3

How is the photon sphere of a black hole not the event horizon?,1597117853,"At the photon sphere orbital velocity is light speed, so how can you go below orbital velocity(below the photon sphere) and not be at the event horizon( defined as where escape velocity is light speed. If you tried to raise the orbit you'd need to go faster than light speed which obviously isn't possible. 

Is the distinction because the photon sphere requires a tangential velocity and escape velocity is only from the center directly outward? So in practice most things have some tangential velocity or very rarely would be moving directly away from a black hole while that close to it(making the photon sphere a realistic limit while not the mathematical limit)?",astrophysics,thunts7,/r/astrophysics/comments/i7kkw3/how_is_the_photon_sphere_of_a_black_hole_not_the/,3
Astronomy Major vs. Physics Major,1597109534,"Hi, I posted about this a while ago but I'm still unsure about my decision:

I am going to be attending Stony Brook University this Fall as a freshman and my dream is to become an astrophysicist. My current major is Astronomy/Planetary Sciences and the major I am thinking of switching to is Physics. I thought the obvious choice would be Astronomy but would taking physics help me more on this path because of its versatility and specificity to the physics part of astrophysics? Would physics be the overall better choice anyway due to that versatility in a professional/career sense?

Tidal Circularization Process: the Moon — What causes it?,1596302318,"Hello my fellow astrophysicists,

I hope your Augusts are treating you well.

Around a year ago, I came across an astronomical process I couldn't quite understand. As plenty of you already know, two gravitationally bound celestial bodies affect each other in a number of interesting ways. One being them orbiting their common center of mass (the barycenter), the second being various tidal interactions (tidal acceleration, deceleration etc.).

The Moon and Earth also interact in these ways. The Moon is already tidally locked to Earth. The Earth is in the process of being tidally locked with the Moon. Each year, the Moon slowly inches away from us and in turn the Earth's rotation slows a tiny bit each year. Interestingly enough, I found out that this process affects the Moon's orbit in peculiar ways. It appears that the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is decreasing and becoming more circular.

I am struggling to understand how this happens. I've done research on it, but sadly can't understand explanations. So I figured that this subreddit may be a good place to find the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand, part of the answer seems to come from the Moon's rotation itself. From [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdA5WkDNALetBn4iFeSepHjdLGJdxPBwZyY47ir1bZGAK/space/orbits/tidal_circularize.html):

&gt;""One is that the strength of tidal forces is an inverse-cube function of distance (it's one power stronger than the gravitational force because it varies with the gradient of the gravitational force).  So the tidal effects are stronger, and the bulges significantly higher, at periapsis than at apoapsis.  The other is that the moon has to rotate at a uniform rate, while an elliptical orbit doesn't go around the planet at a uniform rate.  So the tidal bulges move back and forth over the surface a bit, staying (more or less) with the orbital motion even though it doesn't quite match the rotation.""

The first part I do understand; it makes sense that the tidal forces would be stronger when the Moon is closer to the Earth then further away. I don't really understand the part that mentions how the Moon ""has to"" rotate at a uniform rate. It does make sense that it would rotate faster at perigee (due to its rotation and revolution being the same).

The one thing that has me stumped is this:

&gt;""Exactly how all this turns into circularization of the orbit is a little trickier to follow in detail, but consider the second effect, rotation versus orbital motion.  At periapsis, where the moon is moving fastest, rotation lags behind orbital motion.  The moon is not rotating fast enough to keep the tidal bulges lined up with the planet.  The nearside bulge pulls ahead of the planet, the farside one falls behind.  (If this sounds like the wrong way around, you need to draw a picture -- this description is correct.)  Since the two bulges are at different distances from the planet, the gravitational pull on the nearside (leading) one is stronger. Since the bulge is leading the moon slightly, and the pull is toward the center of the planet, the pull is not quite along the planet-moon axis. So there is a small backward force on the bulge, decelerating the moon. The effect of deceleration at periapsis is lower apoapsis -- that is, circularization of the orbit.""

It's probably that I just don't understand the language of this. I'm not sure how ""rotation lags behind orbital motion"" and what nearside and farside bulges are. Can someone explain this to me? Please be kind, I'm not Isaac Newton. Any posts are greatly appreciated. Thank you!",astrophysics,StellarExile,/r/astrophysics/comments/i1vt7u/tidal_circularization_process_the_moon_what/,11

this is one comment I made, and I would like to see if I made any mistakes here. first, is it correct to assume that since we (the universe) is/are expanding 40 miles per second for every megaparsec that is between us and the center of the universe, that we will multiply that x +1. 

\-----

E.g. 

if we are 3 megaparsecs from true center, we are being pushed by expanding energy behind us at 120 miles per second on top of our 40mps? i know right away that a lot of complex math is being ignored here, but I'm a machinist. give me a break.

\-------

 gravity will pull at some degree for infinity, but at some point, that is negligible. whether it be from interference or just being insignificant compared to your own gravitational pull, the outcome is the same. assuming you just launched from earth and are now floating next to it, your velocity is equal to that of earth PLUS exit velocity. after you normalize that and match with earth, your current velocity in relation to our sun is now 67,000mph however, the arms around our galaxy are screamingly fast. if you stopped moving completely, you likely would lose track of earth and the sun very fast. we calculate velocity in relativity to the nearest anchor point like earth. that's what I mean by relative velocity. if you were to reach a true state of 0 velocity, god be with you because nobody can save you then. you'll be hundreds of thousands of miles away before we can even begin a blink reflex. that is my understanding.   basically the universe itself is expanding at 40ish miles per second per megaparsec. if we cut the shit and rough grease out some numbers using only the known universe and assuming an equal sized portion lies beneath it, you will have to imagine seeing the planet yanked out from underneath you at roughly 100,000 miles per SECOND. i'd love to get a professional opinion on this though as calling my knowledge ground level on the  matter is wishful at best.",astrophysics,IamBladesm1th,/r/astrophysics/comments/i1prar/question_about_how_fast_we_are_going_is_this_the/,9

Is There a Possibility That Firewalls Could Exist Around Black Holes’ Event Horizons?,1595772244,"A solitary discharge of Hawking radiation includes two commonly caught particles. The active molecule get away and is transmitted as a quantum of Hawking radiation; the infalling molecule is gulped by the dark opening.

At that point, it will just emanate a limited measure of data encoded inside its Hawking radiation. Expect that at time (t) t, the greater part of the data had just been produced. As indicated by broadly acknowledged examination by physicists like Don Page and Leonard Susskind, an active molecule produced at time t must be caught with all the Hawking radiation the dark opening has recently produced. This makes a paradox: a rule called ""monogamy of entanglement"" requires that, similar to any quantum framework, the active molecule can't be completely entrapped with two autonomous frameworks simultaneously; yet here the active molecule has all the earmarks of being ensnared with both the infalling molecule and, freely, with past Hawking radiation.",astrophysics,RedditUser72_423,/r/astrophysics/comments/hy7gf8/is_there_a_possibility_that_firewalls_could_exist/,0

what would happen if a black hole spun too close to the speed of light?,1595676910,"first of all, i know next to nothing about space physics, i'm juat curious, so let me know if there is something fundamentally wrong with my thinking.

i remember hearing in a vid that the faster a black hole spins, the smaller its event horizon gets, as in, things can orbit it closer than they would a stationary black hole, without being lost forever, and i'm guessing stars do this as well, but one spinning too fast would rip itself apart when the spinning overcame the gravity, but what about black holes? the thing about them is that ""nothing escapes"" after entering the event horizon, but what if one spun at 99.9999999...% the speed of light, would it also be ripped apart? or would the time distortion due to the extreme speed prevent something of the sort from happening? or would the event horizon simply cease be, leaving just a singularity behind? would the singularity's density have a strong enough gravitational pull to keep it together at all?

i imagine that its either impossible or unlikely that a black hole would just happen to be spinning this fast, but what if a super advanced society, one that has the tech to harness galaxies's worth of energy, were to ""feed"" a black hole angular momentum, making it spin faster? i assume you cant just slap it to make it spin faster, but maybe slingshotting other stars or black holes near its event horizon to accelarate it in the process or something of the sort?

How to start studying the mathematics behind astrophysical concepts,1595263999,"I know this probably gets asked a lot, but does anyone have a good idea or suggestion on where to start studying astrophysics? 

I have been reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts and what not about astrophysics and space in general, for the past few years. I have learned a lot about the most diverse topics and an absolutely fascenated by them. 

Even though I really enjoy learning more about these topics, I just ""know"" the ideas and concepts themself and just the absolute basics about the math and fysics behind these ideas. 

I am currently going into my last year of high school and am planning on studying astrophysics at university, but really want to study this more in the meantime. I'm wondering if anyone has a good idea as to where and how to study the physics and maths itself. And or if this is a good idea at all and it would be better to just wait till university. (I'm not an American student so taking college classes is not an option (if that's how these work.))

Question about the fabric of spacetime.,1595254341,"    We all know the classical demonstration of showing how objects with large amounts of mass warp spacetime. (Placing a large ball at the center of a stretched out sheet and letting other marbles process around it.) But something that has been on my mind. 

    To preface, I am someone who independently learns about this subject matter in my own free time so please forgive me if I am lacking some sort of basic understanding. 

    Due to the previously mentioned demonstration I have always pictures one extremely large, possibly infinite, flat plane. The questions on my mind are as follows: Is there a Z axis? Is this flat plane actually multiple planes stacked upon each other? Obviously in space you are free to move whichever direction you choose. Celestial bodies can be lightyears apart from one another above, below, diagonally, etc. How does your spacial location affect the fabric of spacetime? 

   Again, I apologize for this somewhat ridiculous question. I’m really struggling to grasp this concept for some reason. Thank you in advance to any replies and answers.",astrophysics,KodaKodama,/r/astrophysics/comments/hulxnd/question_about_the_fabric_of_spacetime/,12

Is there a simple explanation for why the 2nd postulate of special relativity is true?,1595148136,"I was watching a video on the derivation of the lorentz factor and have some questions (link to the video is at the end of my post, incase my explanation isnt clear). The video stars off by talking about a photon emitter which has a mirror stationed a certain vertical distance away from it. This emitter is inside of a moving spaceship. So the photon creates a zig zag path. If you take one of the diagonal lines from this zig zag, you can derive the lorentz factor using pythagorean theorem. v is the velocity of the spaceship, and t is the amount of time that has passed for someone stationary outside the spaceship that's observing the spaceship. So the horizontal distance the photon has traveled is vt. The height of the triangle is cT (T being the amount of time that has passed for someone inside the ship observing the photon, and obviously c is the speed of light.). 

This next part is where my understanding goes out the door. The hypotenuse of this triangle (which is the diagonal line we took from the zig zag) is equal to ct. I searched online for an explanation, and I found out that the 2nd postulate of special relativity says that the speed of light is independent of the relative motion of the source. Can someone explain to me in a relatively simple way why this is true?

For all intents and purposes, my end goal is having a simple 3D field of 3D vectors representing local estimated field strengths for visualization purposes.

(I struggle generating this data from spherical harmonics approximations, likely even misunderstanding how these were made; my math skills are a bit underdeveloped in this area \*cough physics dropout cough\*)

The 10th degree approximation from this paper is almost exactly what I'd need... except it's mostly conceptually discussed if I read this right.

So... something like this, but with actual data to work torugh. Can be very low res, this is for a visualization test in a video game. Maybe 1 million vectors or so spaced evenly for a start, then I'd be as happy as a clam.

Speed at aphelion is decreasing for Parker Solar Probe with each new orbit despite being closer to the Sun,1594449714,"I am looking at some data from the Parker Solar Probe mission and I was looking at the speeds of PSP at perihelion and aphelion at each new, different, orbit (the orbits caused by a gravity assist of which there are 8) and I found something which I can't explain. Firstly the speeds at perihelion increase after each orbit which makes sense because PSP is getting closer and closer to the Sun. Then I noticed that the speeds at aphelion actually decrease after each new orbit which I don't understand because the aphelion positions are also getting closer and closer to the Sun. Then I found here (in the Timeline section) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker\_Solar\_Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe) a graph of PSP's velocity vs time, and again velocity at aphelion is slightly decreasing as the orbit gets closer to the Sun.

Question about the peaks of gravitational waves,1594336802,"So when viewing your standard example of spacetime being weighed down by a black hole, or by any massive object, you see the apparent fabric of spacetime being pulled 'down'. 

When discussing gravitational waves, we know the fabric of spacetime ripples and must have a sinusoidal wave shape. 

It was also recently discussed on a Fermilab YouTube video that these gravitational waves can be constructive and destructive just like normal waves.


Now here is the question. What would happen if you were able to place many gravitational wave 'sources' in such a way around spacetime where there constructive inferences of spacetime would come together at one point and cause a huge spike of 'positive'? Gravitational waves. What if you caused this spike to take place at a black hole?

I understand very large stars to collapse into black holes when they run out of elements subject to fusion (limiting internal pressure) and they collapse. Is this process reversible? If not, is this the only thing (state of matter or energy or ?) that can happen to matter that is irreversible?
It seems strange a star could be fed extra elements subject to fusion (hydrogen) to delay collapse but that nothing can be fed to it after collapse to undo the transformation.

Having done my Bachelors in Computer Science, I am more inclined towards numerical analysis and high performance computing, and consequently, with an interest in Astrophysics, I would like to work on astrophysical simulations. I have spent some time self-studying books/papers/articles on Theoretical Astrophysics and completed some MOOCs. I had planned for applying for Masters degree as I now feel comfortable enough with Bachelors level Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics. But, given the situation of pandemic in my country, I don't think I will have an option to pursue a degree course here or in another country for a while. Also I would like to utilize time ahead of me to learn more about research in this domain.

* Liverpool John Moores University - [https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduates/astrophysics-msc](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduates/astrophysics-msc)

* University of Southern Queensland - [https://www.usq.edu.au/study/degrees/master-of-science/astrophysics/international](https://www.usq.edu.au/study/degrees/master-of-science/astrophysics/international#entry-requirements)

There are other courses like [University of York Astronomy PGDip](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/courses/pgdip-astronomy/), which I do not find very useful considering that I want to pursue research, and so a fair amount of focus on research (I prefer theoretical and computational) is must for me. Thesis and projects are among my primary requirements (because of my specific interest in Stellar Structure and Evolution, which I would like to investigate further). So, in short, I would prefer the course to be technically demanding instead of being SciComm oriented, where I can work on projects under someone's guidance. This is the primary reason why I have placed LJMU above Swinburne University in my list so far.

Now, fast forward to our current theory of the end of our universe. Dark matter makes up the vast majority of our universe, and the matter we understand and exist on will eventually decay into a soup of photons/protons(???) 

Will entropy truly render our ever expanding universe into a cold meaningless ""death"" or with enough time, will dark matter pool together into their own version of early ""dark matter stars?""

Is it guaranteed that a rocky planet like Earth would be destroyed if hit/engulfed by the outer layers of a star during a nova/supernova?,1594027802,"So, I've always searched for this information by I can't quite find it.   


I want to know if it's certain that a rocky planet like Earth would in fact be destroyed if the outer layers of a star ever engulfed it during nova/supernova.

  
I'm asking that cause, as much as it's certain that life would be wiped out, we're still talking about extremely sparse plasma, much much less dense than Earth's atmosphere for example.

Even considering the atmosphere were blown away and the rocky part of the planet melted again by the heat, I can't imagine how such sparse plasma could have the power to actually blow the now molten Earth.

I imagine however that it could vaporize it, it if it's heated to that point. But that's where my question lies: Will this actually happen?

Heat exchange by conduction would be minimal I guess, but heat exchange by radiation will predominate, and being surrounded by extremely hot and luminous plasma will make it difficult for the Earth to enter in thermal equilibrium at any temperatures lower than those required for melt iron and nickel (which will then vaporize pretty efficiently once the surroundings will constantly blow away the vapors from the surface of the molten Earth and keep a near vacuum around it).  


But, still, I can't figure in what time scale that would happen and if this would be fast enough to destroy it during the nova/supernova.

Secrets on Soap Bubbles,1593827730,"Hi, I'm a fan of science and thought experiments ever since I was a child, and had an interesting idea that's based on existing information about the cosmos. I was wondering if my thought experiment may have any merit, and if anyone with a higher understanding of cosmological physics could weigh in the current vision of science and if my thought experiment has any place in the realm of possibility.

1. Recently we've learned from the Chandra X-ray Observatory about the possibility that the observable universe may not be isotropic.
2. Two teams observing separate portions of the sky reported that at the early age of 0.8 billion years old, the universe exhibited directional favoritism in the strengths and weakness of the laws of physics.

What if these things are tied together in hidden and secretive ways only string theory can unfurl? Ever since I explored the possibility of there being more universe outside the observable universe, that excited my imagination - If i flew a star-ship in a straight line, how long will I fly until I reach another Milky way with an alternate mirror Earth? I later realized that galaxies are many, and the universe may be full of earth-like planets, and that space beyond the horizon might as well be infinite, and if it isn't, it's still incredibly vast in ways I can't begin to understand. So I answered my early question long ago with, It would be incredibly rare to find another mirror earth because the chances are separated by a very large difference in distance.

As I read these new paper studies on how laws may vary, and that the expansion of the cosmos may be irregular and conditional to mysterious dark energy patters - I began to think, ""if the laws of physics are different, then how can life arise as we know it."" Perhaps far away the left side of the universe is devoid of life, same to the right, but forward, back, up and down may contain civilizations all across the timeline of existence.

How is the multiverse, microwave background, and these new findings paint the picture?

Imagine we are on a thin band floating in a speechless void between two universes with very similar properties that vary slightly, each universe playing tug-of-war with our existence. Among infinite variations of different types of universes and laws of nature blending together, we exist where life is allowed because two universes neighboring one another created the perfect habitat for matter energy to become conscious and aware to ask this question.

Please add to the idea, or criticize it.

Could we think of dark matter as an analogy to moving the spacetime plane vertically?,1593612520,"I was listening to Neil deGrasse Tyson's book, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, and while listening to him explain dark matter. From my understanding, the dark matter has gravity, yet it doesn't interact like normal matter. This made me think: if we think of spacetime like a sheet, where masses cause the sheet to dip, could the dark matter in the universe be thought of as a change in the vertical position of the plane (at least in galaxies)? 

*what went through my head when listening to the book*
Dr. Tyson kept referencing dark matter as being six times more prevalent than normal matter in galaxies. The fact that the amount if dark matter was so constant in the galaxies made me think just that: it was a constant. Similar to how in linear equations, the constant is represented as a y-intercept, which made me of transfering the idea of a dark matter y-intercept to the idea of a spacetime plane.

Things which spin interest me.,1593319123,"So the Moon is spinning on its axis with something like 99% perfection in accordance with its orbit about Earth which is phenomenal.  I love that, like...what are the odds, and how does something like that even happen?  

Then the Earth is orbiting the Sun(because Earth is the center of the universe, of course) and that brings us to the Sun.  That star is super special: the sun spots that pop up on occasion are shown to move with differing radial velocities in accordance with their lattitude, proving that not only dies the Sun spin, but also that it spins with different frequency depending on how close you are to the equator or pole.  So that's fun. 

The solar system is spinning around Sagg A*, of course, whoch is an interesting thing.  They say that the black hole doesn't have enough gravitational pull to keep the galaxy intact, so there must be black matter or something... I'm not sure I want to get into that one...its still...pseudoscience?  Nothing is proven?  In any case, the orientation of the orbits is super cool regardless of any scince behind it: I'm going to try and coin the term Galactic Forward here.  Earth's North pole is nearly perpindicular to the Sun, and it is also the direction that the solar system is moving, or Solar Forward(assuming we are not moving South...I never actually looked into that), but Solar Forward is ""up"" or ""down"" when looking at the solar system from its side.  So the solar system is going foward in the exact opposite manner that a frisbee would move forward.  That means that Earth's orbit is perpindicular to the galactic orbit of solar systems.  In this same manner it can be deduced that Sagg A* is spinning also perpindicularly to Earth's orbit around the Sun.  Holding this logic true, it expands that the Galactic Forward is always east or west, never north or south, when viewed from the surface of Earth.  

The Milky Way is going somewhere...I read an article a while back about how astronomers determined that a bunch of the galaxies in our vicinity are all converging on a single point[...the name Virgo Cluster rings a bell, I'll edit this section later...]  I suppose where I'm going with all this is the simple logical progression that since everything in our galaxy rotates that the rotational momentum must have come from a source which was originally spinning, and wonder if the universe looks like a disc from the side, like a spiral galaxy made of galaxies.

Enough about planets, how about those atoms and subatomic particles?  Electrons spin around atoms to the best of our knowledge, but do atomic nuclei spin as well?  Do electrons spin on an axis like Earth does?  Those are not an astrophysics questions, but this is: do photons spin?  I could totally see a beam of light spinning like it was shot from a gun with rifling.

In theory, there are rotating Black Holes that can have their rotation accelerated by particles, in special circumstances.

In reality, when an object is rotated at a high enough speed, the force of rotation(angular momentum) can overcome whatever forces bind matter to the object in question. Think of a snowball attached to some rotating jig - when this jig rotates the snowball fast enough, the weak forces holding it together fail and snow chunks begin flying off of the object along the axis of rotation.

Is there a speed at which a rotating black hole could rotate fast enough, and result in forces that overcome its extreme gravity?

Am I right in assuming it simply follows the inverse square law, so that the distance for the same force should be the square root of the increase? So in our example, Alpha Centauri would have to be 43.67 light years distant instead of 4.367 light years distant.

How does the Universe looks like in a photon's frame of reference?,1593150600,"So, what does a photon see. lets imagine a camera is being thrown with a propulsion system strong enough to keep it traveling in speed of light. What does the image taken by camera looks like?.
According to special relativity photon doesn't experience time at all, hence for a photon it gets emitted and immediately gets absorbed.
All the distance travelled by it is reduced to a single point in its frame of reference
( If we put all the space into a point shouldn't we get a singularity?)
Does that mean photon always exist in a singularity?
Just like inside the singularity of a Black Hole, will the space and time change roles from a photon's point of view
From its view is it travelling in time and not in space?
Does this link to the reason that we always see the past ( similar to a time traveller who has come to future from the past. Where he experience no time at all, while everything else has aged and moved on to future.)

Could repeated gravity assists affect a small body's orbit?,1593115013,"I learned recently that a spacecraft ""steals"" velocity from a planet when it uses that planet to perform a gravity-assisted velocity change, either speeding up or slowing down the planet in its orbit.

Imagine it's 200 years from now, and travel throughout our solar system is common. A mining station is built into an asteroid in heliocentric orbit.

I've decided to make the switch - where do I begin?,1592893505,"Hi /r/astrophysics!

I have always been fascinated by astronomy, ever since I was young. The idea that there is a unfathomable universe with mind boggling phenomena just waiting to be discovered draws on my curiosity like nothing else.


I've spent my life avoiding pursuing this as a career because I lack confidence in my math and physics skills. I worry about the diminishing job market for PhDs in this field. But ultimately there is nothing else I would rather do. It has taken me several years to come to this conclusion.


Some background about me:
I turn 27 this year, I am a former software developer, I went to school for computer science (Bachelor of Science). I have taken calculus and classical physics. I have a fair amount of experience using Python, JavaScript, and Linux to perform data analysis and automation and I believe this will be helpful in the field of astrophysics. 


Here's what I'd like to know:
What on Earth do I do now? Can I watch online lectures and work out practice problems, take the GRE, and apply for graduate school? Do I actually need to attend classes at a university and network with professors? Do I need an undergraduate degree related to astronomy? Can I cherry-pick the classes that are relevant?

Its pretty obvious what Dark Matter and Dark Energy is if you use common sense logic,1592882116,"Mark down your dates on the calendar with my name. I've solved it without needing to  spend hundreds of millions on colliders and fuse reactors.

Higher dimensions can be mathematically and anecdotally be proven to be true (go have a large dose psychedelic trip).

Humans are limited on the electromagnetic spectrum to what our senses can pick up and what our brains can intuitively comprehend that information due to our stage of evolution (evolution is no different than the universe expanding, the biology version of the stereotypically physics thing).

The electromagnetic spectrum IS OUR DIMENSION. Humans and Ants are in the same dimension yet look how different we are. The end goal of evolution is a sentient being who embodies and picks up the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Dark matter and dark energy is AFTER the electromagnetic spectrum, thus the next dimension. It is literally the world around us we cannot see, the particles above us. Other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum still can crack through the ducts because it is still in our dimension, but all things dark is the next dimension.

The entire electromagnetic spectrum brought together as mathematic sum = the singularity or our dimension. The sum of all things of one dimension means you traverse into the next and you see the world that has been invisible to you all this time. The singularity is through the black hole. Interesting that its black. Wonder what the avatar you play in a video game feels to its bones that's whats there? This black screen behind which we are watching it and eyes in the void, in the blackness, staring back. The God's to us watching us.

Once sentience breaks the entire electromagnetic spectrum, sentience of this dimension evolve into the sentience of the next.

Galaxy Collisions and the Big Freeze,1592805834,"I like to learn about astrophysics in my spare time. I was fascinated to learn today that astronomers predict that the Andromeda Galaxy will collide with the Milky Way about 4 billion years from now. 

(This part is just showing my thought process about my question. From what I’ve seen, The Big Freeze is the most widely viewed prediction about what will eventually happen to our universe. The idea is that celestial bodies move away from each other so much, and stars will all eventually die out, to the point that the universe will basically have no heat and the universe will be incapable of supporting any life. It will continue to expand endlessly because of the expansion of space itself. 

Given the fact that Andromeda will collide with the Milky Way because of the way gravity works, wouldn’t other galaxies also be colliding in the universe? And since other galaxies are colliding with each other, wouldn’t this increase the gravitational force of these galaxies, and lead to galaxies not moving away from each other as quickly? Wouldn’t this galaxies to begin to cluster together more and more?

But we also have to consider the expansion of space itself. Is the rate that space expands occurring at a faster rate than galaxies are moving toward each other? If it is, then there would still eventually be a big freeze, but would galaxies form into super massive galaxies before they enter big freezes? But since many galaxies (I know the Milky Way and andromeda do) have massive black holes at their centers that give off Hawking radiation, and eventually these black holes die, wouldn’t that give off heat and particles into the universe? But then this energy would eventually die out too, right?

Breaking the Speed of Light,1592542245,"My thought is since motion is relative, it is possible we are already going faster than the speed of light relative to other objects. To simplify what I am getting at, I have a thought I wanted to share and see what others thought.

Now let's imagine that we have the technology to launch an object at 299,792,457 m/s from Earth. Launching it prograde (I'm not sure if I'm correctly using that term) to Earth's orbit, adding the 460 m/s to the speed of the launch.  Relative to our sun it would be traveling at 299,792,917 m/s.

If there is symmetry then maybe you can justify there being some type of pattern, and use that pattern to make a best estimate of where there would be life, but that's assuming a lot about how physics work, and I don't know that much about astrophysics, compared to my knowledge of electrophysics and newtonian mechanics.",astrophysics,brain_enhancer,/r/astrophysics/comments/hakh2w/probably_naive_but_interesting_thought_popped/,1

What would life be like in a binary star system?,1592151437,"Hey, all. I'm writing a science fiction story set on an Earth-like planet (same gravity and atmospheric pressure) orbiting a small, bright star that is orbiting a larger, dimmer star. I want to be accurate with what the view of this system is like from the surface of the planet, which has a rotation period of about an Earth day and an orbital period of about an Earth year around the smaller star. The planet + small star system would have an orbital period around the large star of hundreds of Earth years. All three bodies are basically rotating and orbiting on same plane (or at least as much as the Earth-Moon-Sun system).

I'm wondering how to think about the equivalent of the solar constant for each star (so I can figure out how much energy life on the planet can use to evolve) and how close these three bodies can be to each other while still remaining in the orbital configuration I've described above for at least a few billion years.

Neat-o Sci-Fi would be for the large star to be a red giant that takes up a significant portion of the sky but doesn't offer much heat or light, and its companion a tiny hot nourishing pin prick of light. Then, ideally, there are two seasons of the year when the planet is furthest from a syzygy, and a thin tail of matter can be seen streaming from the teardrop-shaped large star into the small star. Then one long-night season while the smaller eclipses the larger, then a season where there is no night because one star rises as the other sets. But I can think this could be problematic in a few ways, can anyone confirm:

\-If the large star is large in the sky, its solar constant would be high enough to fry everything on the planet and/or its gravity would be enough to destabilize the planet's orbit.

\-If the small star is pulling stellar matter from the large star, passing through that stellar matter during the no night season would fry everything on the planet. This could be avoided by tilting the planet's orbit.

\-If the small star is close enough to the large star to be grabbing its matter, the planet would pass close enough to the large star during the no night season to be destabilized. Maybe this could be avoided by tilting the orbit by 90 degrees, which would change the seasons I described, but might be more plausible.

Maybe the large star has to be far away for life to be plausible around the small star, and that would be fine I suppose. But I'd rather describe the roiling complex surface of a dim red giant filling the sky.

Black Hole deterioration question,1591987241,"about a month ago, I watched a video that tried to explain the concept of a Black Hole deterioration. In which a Black Hole does not or is not able to absorb any matter for a period of time. Because of this, it shrinks leaving behind a perfect vacuum. Then eventually the Black hole will get so small that it will explode, releasing all of the matter it had collected in an unimaginable explosion.

\----

So... I got to thinking. There is a theory that the universe expands to a certain point and then collapses in on itself and the cycle begins all over again.

What if these two things are related? 

I don't know how to properly explain this... What I envision is a super-massive black hole that shrinks enough so that this 'perfect vacuum' it leaves behind is powerful enough to ""pull"" in more matter. This cycle of pulling in more matter and it shrinking would continue until this singular black hole is the only thing left in the universe. Now that there is nothing else left for it to consume it begins to shrink. Until it reaches a tipping point and ... the resulting explosion is what we would then refer to as ""The Big Bang"".

Is a black hole affected by its own time dilation?,1591904303,"So a few nights ago I had a dream about a black hole and in my dream I wondered if the following would be possible:

Would it be possible to outlive a black hole by using its own time dilation?

When you fall into a black hole, time passes much slower for you, so does this mean you would see a ""movie"" of the future of the universe sped up?

For the following bit this question is important: is a black hole affected by its own time dilation?

Time dilation occurs when traveling at high speeds, right? When you fall into a black hole, you're traveling at really high speeds, but is the black hole traveling at such speeds as well?

Assume I'm falling into a black hole, but survive things like radiation, heat, spaghettification etc.
Would it be possible to outlive the black hole, because time passes much slower for me?

If a black hole is affected by its own time dilation, probably not, because time for the black hole passes slower as well.
But if its not affected, the black hole ages much faster than me.

'Oumuamua Could Be a Failed Star,1591208983,"This article ([https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-hydrogen-iceberg-from-a-failed-star-might-have-passed-through-our-solar-system/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-hydrogen-iceberg-from-a-failed-star-might-have-passed-through-our-solar-system/)) goes through a paper (Seligman &amp; Laughlin 2020) recently published in ApJ. Its thesis is that the extraterrestrial object 'Oumuamua is actually not a comet, but instead a port-stellar remnant. In the star formation process, molecular Hydrogen (H2) temperatures are extremely low before ignition of any sort of fusion, such that if a star got close to forming, but didn't ignite, you might have a big ball of Hydrogen ice left over.

This theory is proposed to answer a couple key oddities of 'Oumuamua:

1: **Oumuamua was observed to** ***accelerate*** **away from the sun.** 

Weird right? Experts believe that this was due to some melting and offgassing of surface material heated up by the sun. Water ice does not evaporate fast enough to account for the observed acceleration, but H2 ice does. 

2: **Oumuamua's cigar shape.**

Oumuamua is famously a long, cigar-like object, part of what made it so interesting. The object is also observed to rotate very fast, 1 rev per 8hrs. The idea here is that Oumuamua had been offgassing for a while, and burning off surface hydrogen from what originally was a spherical object, kind of like a cosmic rotisserie. Astronomers only detected Oumuamua after its closest approach to the sun, so it would have had plenty of time to sublimate down to its observed shape.

3. **'Oumuamua was observed to move at the same speed as the sun moves through the Galaxy.**

This part is probably the most straightforward to answer. The object simply wasn't moving before the sun swept by it. So we observe it moving at the same speed as the sun, just in the opposite direction. 

What does this all mean? Well, the fact that this object came close enough for us to detect it means there are lots of these floating around, more than predicted. This implies repercussions on our understanding of star formation, and (also cool) we will probably observe more similar objects.",astrophysics,notashamedtosayit,/r/astrophysics/comments/gvzj0f/oumuamua_could_be_a_failed_star/,14

1. How many stars are within 100 Light Years of Sol? I am sure we have catalogued our local region? I had read that there were over 10,000 stars?
2. How many starts are within 1000 LY diameter? What is the composition and distribution of stellar types/objects?
3. Out of curiosity, what would happen if the star Altair (16 LY distance) went nova/super nova from Sol? What would we observe?  What effects would such a massive explosion so close to us have on our solar system?

I would greatly appreciate hearing discussion or comments from others out there.

Planetary design for a fantasy setting,1590965740,"This is kind of an odd request, so please bear with me. I'm not even sure this is the proper sub, but since there isn't one specific to planetology I figured I'd ask here and if you all couldn't help then you might point me in the right direction.  I apologize in advance if anything I say or describe sounds ridiculous or completely unrealistic; I don't have an education in physics beyond a single class I took over 25 years ago. It was never my focus during my education (an oversight which is just now biting me in the ass).

I'd created a fantasy setting for D&amp;D some years back that included some lore about the world that may or may not be possible, specifically in regard to the orbital mechanics. To break it down:

1. The world has seasons much like Earth, and is habitable
2. The world was described as having a southern hemisphere that was consistently colder and experienced longer winters and shorter summers than the northern hemisphere
3. One area in the lowest latitudes of the southern hemisphere is described as never seeing daylight; the reverse is true for an area in the highest latitudes of the northern hemisphere, and it having unending daylight. Neither of these areas is described in terms of size

I've been having discussions with a couple of people today regarding this, and they're convinced that there is no combination of axial tilt, rotational pattern, or orbit that would create this kind of planet. I have a mental image in my mind that suggests otherwise, but I don't have the language necessary to express it, nor the artistic skills to demonstrate it.

So, my question is simple: is it possible? And if so, how would I describe it in a manner that is relatively easy to understand? In part so I can explain it to the players in my games, but also because I'd really like to have a better understanding myself.

Help Me Understand Universe Expansion,1590535776,"I'm fairly unknowledgeable when it comes to what we know about the universe, however, I've heard people mention that the universe is observed to be expanding.

I've also heard mention that due to our expansion, matter is becoming further and further apart. Is this true, or is it a misconception due to a misunderstanding of an ""expanding"" universe. In the case the universe *is* actually expanding, is there a central point where the expansion is originating?

Related would be that our universe is expanding faster as time goes on. Is this true? Wouldn't it be ""expanding"" at the speed of light?

But I don't understand why a black hole singularity is 'infinitely dense'. Why can't we give it a value?

We know the density and mass of stars right? And we know the mass of black holes, so why is the density infinite? A star's core has a finite density, then why would it become infinitely dense after it collapses? We know the mass, the volume, and the amount of matter, right?

What about super massive blackholes? Are they more 'infinitely dense' than other black holes? Or are all black holes equally infinitely dense as each other? Also, they can't have a density of infinity if black holes eventually fizzle out. That implies the density has an end or is decreasing over time.",astrophysics,yeah1526,/r/astrophysics/comments/gnvxbt/why_are_black_holes_infinitely_dense/,9

An interesting question on Black Holes and Dark Energy,1590056118,"We've all heard of the 3 ways the universe could die, right?

There's the Big Crunch, where the expansion of the universe shifts into reverse, and everything eventually falls back into the singularity that was the focal point of the Big Bang. This theory....doesn't have alot of backing since that reversal shift would require some pretty weird physics.

There's the Big Freeze, which, at the moment, is the most accepted theory. Entropy takes over the universe, and everything slowly dies with a whimper. The last flashes of light that the universe would see would be the death of black holes as they slowly evaporate from Hawking Radiation.

And then there's The Big Rip. At first, this theory seemed just as implausible as The Big Crunch, but over time, it has gotten a bit more backing. Dark Energy takes over, and pushes the expansion of the universe to such insane levels, that it eventually starts to rip apart galaxies...solar systems...planets and stars themselves...and even atoms. Every other force in the universe just flat out loses to the overwhelming nature of Dark Energy.

It's the third option I'd like to focus on right now. Lets say the expansion of the universe starts getting out of control before entropy can really take over. A future Milkomeda (the combination of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy that really needs a new name) is left all alone in utter darkness as even the other galaxies in our local group have moved out of our shrinking observable universe. It slowly grows more and more disperse as Dark Energy starts to rip stars out of the gravitational influence of the now combined Supermassive Black holes, until even that is left all alone in a pitch black environment.

My question is.....what happens to the Black Hole? It would take quite a long time for the Dark Energy to have any noticeable effect on it (and we're talking trillions of years here), but what happens when the expansion of the space around the black hole starts to over take the insane warping of space these things produce? Do the Event Horizons start to shrink? And if they do, what happens when the Event Horizon reaches the singularity?

Yes, I realize the implications of that last sentence. So, let's assume that 100 million solar masses can be crammed into a measurable ""point"" (an extremely small sphere that's made of......something) that exists in 3 dimensions, just like everything else in the universe. The Event Horizon eventually reaches the outer layer of this ""point"", and the Dark Energy now has free reign over an object with the same mass as a globular cluster.

Do we get another Big Bang (or something along those lines) as the Dark Energy starts to rip the singularity apart? And since there is an infinite amount of black holes potentially, would we get something very similar to the actual Big Bang?

I ask because I just can't help but draw similarities between the Big Bang and this hypothetical scenario. Granted, I wouldn't be surprised if we need to figure out some things before this question can truly be answered. Like, what is at the center of a black hole? What the hell is Dark Energy? Is The Big Bang Theory 100% correct? Things like that. But, does anyone here have any possible clue as to how this could turn out?

P.S. I know that there are technically 4 ways the universe could end, but the last option is so weird and out there, that there's a reason why it tends to get left out of these conversations most of the time.",astrophysics,Electro522,/r/astrophysics/comments/gnu7w8/an_interesting_question_on_black_holes_and_dark/,1

I applied to over 30 REUs during my time in college and did not get into a single one. I managed to get one internship in web development, but that has not helped me at all in appealing to graduate schools. I applied to 3 Ph.D. and 2 masters programs and was rejected from all of them.

I’m going to be a freshman at high school, and I’ve loved space for a long time. I loved looking at the stars and making my own constellations. When I was younger, I used to print out entire packets dedicated on giving me information about a planet, either in our solar system or beyond. The first planet I knew of that was outside our solar system was Kepler 22-b. I was fascinated with it, and how it was like no other planet in our solar system. Despite all of this, I wanted to become a lawyer, because it gave good pay and a solid job. This was all when I was 8. For independent reading one day, I chose the biography of Albert Einstein. I thought that guy was the coolest man in the world and I wanted to be just like him. But I still stuck to being a lawyer for 2 reasons only. When I entered the second half of 7th grade, I looked at everyone I admired: Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking. I realized they were all in similar field in physics. My love for space and interest in physics boiled down to the culmination of my childhood; my dream job: being an astrophysicist. Whew! I’m done. Now on with the question. I have been looking at Universities for a very long time. When I “wanted” to become a lawyer, I was going to go to Harvard. Now, I want to either go to M.I.T., which has a good astrophysics course and is close to Boston, which I’ve wanted to go to for some time, or Stanford, which has a great astrophysics course and is located here in New Jersey.

Is the physical size of space relative as well in timespace?,1589046985,"As the two are intrinsically tied, if time is relative in timespace, shouldn't space be relative too? For example an observer looking at someone who is close to a gravity well or compression, sees time move slower for that person. Perhaps this is because space is compressed and therefore the flow of time simply takes longer to pass through the area of compression. Is it logical to assume that the physical size of space is relative?

For example, lets consider a black hole with an event horizon being 100 km in diameter from an outside observer. If one was to slowly drift past the event horizon of a black hole, as they sunk deeper into the well, space and distance would seem to expand. Suddenly, from an obserer within the black hole, the volume of the area inside the event horizon would be much greater than from an outside observer. As one approaches the singularity, distance becomes near unlimited and the 20km diameter of the black hole from an outside observer stetches lightyears for an inside observer. Consider the zooming in on the Mandelbrot set. From the outside, the space looks limited and the grooves and patterns along the side seem finite and small, but as you zoom in, these grooves and patterns continue to expand. Imagine that moving towards a timespace gravity compression is much like zooming into a fractal: space seems to expand.",astrophysics,SuperFishy,/r/astrophysics/comments/ggk58e/is_the_physical_size_of_space_relative_as_well_in/,1

Becoming an Astrophysics,1588443329,"Hello! I have seen some other posts in this subreddit and just had a few extra questions regarding other posts on becoming an astrophysicists. 

I have currently been accepted into Computer Engineering at University but will make the switch to Software Engineering after my 1st/2nd semester. I chose this career because it has high demand, and wage is also significant to me as long as I am not miserable and decently satisfied with my job. I'm good with computers and coding is something that interests me. 

Becoming an astrophysicist/astro-biologist would be like lowering the wage by a significant amount but by increasing that satisfaction level by a high amount as well. It's like having a really decent paying job that you like or having a average paying job that you love. I just don't know if it's worth taking that leap of faith since there isn't a high demand in astrophysics jobs. Doing research really entices me and having a shot at applying to NASA is exciting to me. What I want more detail on is a wage comparison between the two careers. I have ofcourse searched up wages for the two but they don't necessarily give reliable numbers that matter such as starting salaries for different positions (research company, NASA, a professor, etc.), list of careers in the field sorted by wage or popularity (x% are professors x% do research full time, x% are professors that do research on the side, etc), how these wages differ in different cities or in Canada where I reside.... really just need all the information I can get. I like making decisions when I am really informed on the subject.

Some background; I did pretty well in all my GCSE sciences and my maths was a lil rough but that was because my teacher couldn't teach the new higher paper so I had no choice but to sit a foundation. I then managed to do A Level Physics and Chemistry in year 12 at sixth form however due to both my health (I unfortunatly have been suffering from chronic fatigue since I was 14/15) and my teachers lack of support when I struggled, I got kicked off of both courses after my first year and forced to change subjects.

Some questions about tidally locked celestial bodies with synchronous rotation,1588032741,"Hi everyone!

I'm working on a book and wanted to ask some people smarter than me about how this would work. I'm thinking of having two worlds which are tidally locked to each other. I believe that would mean they have synchronous rotation and would always appear at the same point in the sky.

I'd like to first ask if I'm understanding that correctly. If I am I'd also like to understand:

1) How would this impact the commonality of eclipses for those living on these celestial bodies?

2) Would there be impacts to the likelihood of survivability on these worlds due to this tidal locking? If so, what would those be?

3) How would this affect the seasons on each world?

I understand that I'm probably not giving near enough information about these world to fully answer my questions, but I obviously want people to be able to live on at least one of these worlds, and possibly both. I'm mostly trying to make sure that whatever world(s) I create aren't going to bring red flags to some reader who knows more than me and sees that I haven't done my research.

Any recommendations on how to make this work would be awesome. I'll certainly be doing more research myself on figuring out how to make this fit in the Goldilocks zone and probably won't actually include a ton of this into the story as it's a fantasy, but I want it to be conceivable that this world could exist.

If you think I'm missing anything or have thought of questions I should be asking that I don't know to ask, I'll take any and all comments people have to give.

Object as bright as Mars moving in the sky...,1588032417,"Friday, April 24th, 2020, 20:24 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, Saguenay, Québec, Canada. 

On my back porch, I look up and see Mars glowing; one of the brightest objects in the distance. Suddenly, I notice another object in the sky, equally as bright and posing right beside (300 degrees NW). 

I cling my eyes a few times to make sure I’m not cross eyed, but nothing. Now, the glowing object is slowly moving to the right. The light is very bright, without any visible flames and unlike any plane, satellite or shooting star I’ve seen before. The more it moves to the right, the dimmer it gets, up to the point where it isn’t visible anymore (315 degrees NW). 

From the moment I saw the glowing object to the moment it disappeared from view, about 20 seconds went by. Is anyone able to enlighten me as to what kind of object glows this bright and moves at such speeds?

Nucleosynthesis or Nuclear Fusion?,1588021602,"Hi! First of all I have to say that I'm a passionate about physics and more importantly about astrophysics... Not an expert. So forgive me if I say anything that it's not right.

I wanted to make a Quiz for my family. While I was making the question ""The process by which stars produce energy is called... "" I did some more research and found out that there's a process called ""Nucleosynthesis"" which consist simply in making the rest of chemical elements from 1 or 2 simple elements (like Hydrogen or Helium).

My intention was to state that the process was called ""Nuclear Fusion""... But since nucleosynthesis consist in the same thing (the making of elements from lighter ones in which presumably energy is produced too) I got stuck.

So... 

1. It's more correct to say that the answer is ""nucleosynthesis"" over ""nuclear fusion""? 

2. If I put 3 options, and two of them are ""nuclear fusion"" and ""nucleosynthesis"" which one it's more accurate? Like, for example, nucleosynthesis covers processes such as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion so then it's more correct than saying that the answer is straight ""nuclear fusion"".

Universe expanding,1587978486,"Hello everyone, 

I need some clarification regarding the expansion of universe. 

If all the celestial bodies are moving away from each other at an increased rate, is it possible that the universe is actually contracting to a single point and the galaxies that are closer to the point are being pulled in faster.
It seems to me that we could get the same effect either by contraction or by expansion, but I would appreciate if someone would explain to me why the expansion takes precedence and is there any evidence for contraction.

Thank you for being patient with a layman like me.",astrophysics,shomislav,/r/astrophysics/comments/g8x9vp/universe_expanding/,9

A question about why the sun is mostly hydrogen,1587866078,"I learned via wikipedia that the suns mass is comprised of 75% hydrogen, with most of the rest helium. Heavier elements are somewhere else in the solar system, including a nice mix of them here on mother earth.

This leads me to wonder if in the early development of the solar system, when things were much hotter, more fluid, and less consolidated, there might have existed forces that encouraged lighter elements to reside in lower orbits, and heavier elements to migrate outward. 

Or perhaps the sun simply expunges itself of all heavier than helium. Is that a function of coronal mass ejections? Do they expel heavier elements out into the outer solar system?

Or is there a better explanation as to why the sun is mostly hydrogen.

Just wondering.",astrophysics,Woodporter,/r/astrophysics/comments/g85xpu/a_question_about_why_the_sun_is_mostly_hydrogen/,10

I have always been fascinated by astrophysics and just picked up a few things here and there over time but I really want to mend the gaps in my knowledge.

Here is my background to  help you know what reference can be helpful for me:
I had to take a few physics classes in college and only one short class of quantum physics. I understood enough to do academic coursework but I want to go back and really understand the concepts fully.

Ideally, I would have a mix of references:

- Focus on explaining concepts and what they mean (something that really dumb things down)
- Demontrates how those concepts apply mathematically. (Derivation and utilisation of lorenz transform, mathematical derivation of speed of causality etc..)

My end goal is to become ""comfortable"" with what matter, time, gravity etc really are and their implications.

"Triton, Neptune's largest moon, has a salmon pink south pole!",1587560676,"Triton is the coldest place we know of in the solar system, with a surface temperature just 38 degrees above absolute zero. This temperature is low enough to freeze nitrogen - and nitrogen frost is salmon pink!

Triton has a retrograde orbit (it orbits in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation.)  Moons that form alongside a planet tend to orbit prograde (in the direction of their planet's rotation) since both the moon and the planet form out of the same swirling debris cloud. It is therefore likely that Triton was once free-roaming planetoid caught by Neptune's gravity.

Tidal forces cause moons that orbiting prograde (slower than their planet rotates) to slowly spiral out into space. The moon, for example, is spirals 4 cm away from Earth every year. Conversely, tidal forces gradually rob Triton's retrograde orbit of energy, causing it to spiral into Neptune. In about 100 million years, Triton will fall through Neptune's Roche limit and be torn to pieces, giving Neptune a spectacular ring system.",astrophysics,zorns-lemma,/r/astrophysics/comments/g60qpw/triton_neptunes_largest_moon_has_a_salmon_pink/,4

I need help with a program I'm writing (Matlab) which solves the Kepler problem using the universal variable formulation.,1587537705,"Introduction: I am writing a Matlab program that solves the Kepler problem for any Elliptical, Hyperbolic, or Circular orbit. Given an initial position vector, velocity vector, find the position vector and velocity vector after some given time. I am not doing this for any class, I have been doing this to work on my computer science abilities. The textbook I am using is ""Fundamentals of Astrodynamics"" by Bate, Mueller, and White. The specific program I am working on is a suggested project in the back of the book.

The Problem: My program successfully solves the Kepler problem for all elliptical, hyperbolic, and circular orbits. However, I'm having a hard time solving the case of Parabolic orbits where the denominator of a goes to zero. I tried to resolve this by calculating the reciprocal of a, which then, in this case, is zero. This leads to the initial guess of x_n to be zero, and the initial guess of z_n to be zero as well, which causes the iteration to blow up. I also added a case inside the iteration which computes the values of C_n and S_n using their series representations when the reciprocal of a, called alpha in my program is equal to zero. I attached my Matlab program below.

If anybody thinks they can help me with this I would love to have further conversation, I'd really like to figure this one out!

Am I misunderstanding gimbal lock,1587535891,"So looking at this explanation video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8b2Jo7mno

It seems as though the whole point of a gimbal is to keep track of a spacecraft's attitude *in relation to* something else (say, a line going from earth to the moon).  Is this correct?

If so, does that mean gimbal lock is a problem because the spacecraft computer can't tell what the attitude of the spacecraft is in relation to a path or thing in space because two of the axis have become the same?

So if yaw and roll become locked, you can still freely yaw and roll with the thrusters, but the computer can't tell which one you're doing?

PhD Application Help,1586802508," I recently came to the decision, that I would like to pursue a PhD in Astrophysics (topic TBD).

I  have a MEng from a prestigious University in the UK in Aerospace  Engineering - with an emphasis on space systems and so I wrote to him.

He  hinted that my application would be successful. However, that I would  likely only be able to apply to those instrumentation focused, unless I  obtained a masters degree.

I wanted to arm myself with some information before responding.

My  end goal, is a faculty position in the US/UK/Germany. conducting  research in astrophysics, which I understand is not an easy path.

I  am worried that pursuing an instrumentation focused PhD would not leave  me in a position to do astrophysics research in the fields that  interest me ( observation/interpretation/modelling).

I am also worried, about the cost and time of pursing a Masters degree on top of the 3-4 year PhD.

Does  anyone have any advice about Post PhD opportunities or whether an  online masters degree would help? Or perhaps doing some free online  learning at home in the year before my application would be enough?

I  am trying to make the right choice for my future, and pick the right  field, and take up an opportunity that would lead to the right  job/career path.

To make things  more complicated, I currently reside in the USA and would be looking to  move back for this most likely (the idea of 7 years at a US university  stresses me out just a little too much, I had a bad experience when I  first moved here)

"Cosmic anisotropy has been detected in the X-ray sky by astronomers, which has interesting cosmological implications.",1586796261,"Hello everyone! This is my first serious post on reddit, so I hope you like it. I have been reading a couple of interesting paper that I thought you would like to discuss about (links at the end of the post). The topic is the following: the detection of cosmic anisotropies in the recession velocity of galaxy clusters. I think this is something very cool and I really wanted to share it with you. Don’t hesitate to discuss the topic on the comments.

\# Too-long-I-don’t-want-to-read-it version:

Well, in short, all cosmologists and extragalactic astrophysicists assume the cosmological principle for their studies. On of its implications is that the rate of expansion of the universe is the same in all directions, which allows them to use nice tricks, like measuring the distance to a galaxy by just looking at how quickly is it receding from us through the doppler redshift of their light. The authors of these papers, however, have shown that there is a small but significant variation of the redshift-distance relation on several clusters that are homogeneously scattered across the sky. This would result in one of these two conclusions: either a significant contamination process around the Milky Way is messing with our received X-ray flux (the light range that they are using for this study), which would imply that many of the results of X-ray astronomy need a revisit; or that there is a genuine cosmological anisotropy such as the bulk motion of galaxy clusters or an inhomogeneous expansion rate across the observable universe.

\# Wow that is super interesting, I want to know more about it!

Well, in this case we must clarify what does the cosmological principle postulate, how to measure distances in cosmology, and how can we test it with galaxy clusters.

\## The \*C\*\*\*O\*\*\*S\*\*\*M\*\*\*O\*\*\*L\*\*\*A\*\*\*G\*\*\*I\*\*\*C\*\*\*A\*\*\*L\*\* \*P\*\*\*R\*\*\*I\*\*\*N\*\*\*C\*\*\*I\*\*\*P\*\*\*L\*\*\*E\*:

This principle with such a cool name actually contains two postulates: 

1. \*\*The universe is homogeneous:\*\* averaging over large scales the universe has equal density, composition and expansion rate everywhere. We are talking about average properties inside of volumes containing thousands of galaxies here, since matter density for example is very different inside and outside of galaxies.

2. \*\*The universe is isotropic:\*\* this means that no matter at which direction we look at, we will always find the same average properties at every patch of the sky, as long as we only take into account stuff that is outside of our galaxy.

It is important to understand that these two properties are not the same. A universe with concentric layers of different material with us at the center would be isotropic but not homogeneous, and a universe with a collective motion of galaxies towards one direction could be homogeneous but not isotropic, as we would see galaxies coming towards us in one half of the sky and others moving far away in the other half. So far, these two assumptions have passed observational tests very well and are accounted by as true by most cosmologists and extragalactic astrophysicists, specially since the discovery of the cosmological microwave background (CMB), a background of radiation coming from the time when the universe became transparent 13 billion years ago, which is homogeneous and isotropic on average towards directions.

\## Measuring distances in cosmology:

The universe is expanding. And because of the cosmological principle, it is expanding at the same rate everywhere. This means that, if two galaxies are at the same distance from us, no matter their position in the sky, they will be moving away from as at the same velocity. This opens a window to measuring distances in cosmology: by just looking at the doppler redshift of a galaxy, we know its velocity, and thanks to the Hubble law, which relates distance from us and recession velocity, we can straightforwardly deduce its distance. This, of course, if their peculiar velocities are small compared to the rate of expansion, which is always true for far away objects. 

\## Galaxy clusters as cosmological proves: 

Galaxy clusters are accumulations of galaxies. Our Milky Way and Andromeda are the largest galaxies of our Local Cluster, but there are clusters out there with tenths of galaxies much larger than these two. The important detail about these clusters is that, besides galaxies, a fraction of their mass is contained as diffuse, ionized, hot gas, which is visible in the X-ray due to the electrons emitting high energy radiation. Through a process of equilibrium which I won’t explain in detail as the intergalactic medium is not my field of study, the mass of the cluster decides how hot is the gas, and a combination of its mass and temperature decides the total X-ray luminosity of the hot gas contained in the cluster. Therefore, if you know the temperature of the gas, which can be measured by looking at its X-ray spectrum, you also know the total luminosity of the gas contained in the cluster.

But it turns out that there is an alternative way of knowing the X-ray luminosity of the cluster. As I said before, by looking at the redshift of the galaxies inside of the cluster, we can deduce their distance. Once the distance to a cluster is known, by measuring how bright it appears to us we can compute its total luminosity. And if everything is ok, the results of both methods should be the same… except that they aren’t.

\## The papers and their results:

In the two papers whose links I shared below, they use this method to see if both ways of measuring galaxy cluster distances are consistent. They firstly assume that the cosmological principle holds and calculate the X-ray luminosity of clusters through their brightness and distance, and then they relate it to their temperatures. If all assumptions are correct, they expect to find that all clusters follow the same Luminosity – Temperature relation. Surprisingly, they don’t.

In particular, a constant in the power law of the equation changes depending on which cluster you are looking at, and what is more, the changes in the relationship are consistent with the area of the sky that is being looked at, with a half of the sky where clusters are fainter and another one where they are brighter, the deviation from the mean going up to a 30% in the center of these regions, and with a statistical significance of almost 5σ (a moderately good one). Across the two papers they try the same experiment with clusters from different catalogues and with data achieved from different X-ray telescopes, and this trend appears to persist. Therefore, at least in the X-ray range, the postulate of cosmic isotropy is broken.

\## Implications of the results:

I knew it! The Big Bang is fake and the Earth is flat! This should be the downfall of all Astronomy! Well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. As they discuss in the papers, this could mean that there is contamination process within or around the Milky Way that has not been accounted for, like light absorption being stronger on one side rather than the other, or other unknow systematics. It is left to see scrutinize this trend appears on other kinds of radiation besides X-ray, but as they also remark that similar results based on the infrared and distant supernovae have been achieved. If this trend is consistent across other wavelengths, then this would have to be explained with slightly different expansion rates depending on the region of the universe or with the inclusion of some massive bulk motion of galaxy clusters towards one direction.

And this last paragraph goes to my take on the issue. The authors don’t dare to make such bold claims  on their paper, but perhaps this could be related to the Hubble Tension issue that has been arising in the latter years, in which measuring the Hubble constant with the CMB or distant supernovae gives  very slightly different results. Perhaps, just perhaps, we are staring to see another piece of this puzzle, and I hope that the newly arising fields of Astronomy like gravitational waves can shed more like on this issue, as currently there is active research on using black hole – neutron star mergers as cosmological proves.

IAAC is short for the International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition, and is actually quite different from the Astronomy Olympiad (IAAO). This competition is entirely online, and there are no teams that you have to qualify for to compete on an international level. There are also 3 rounds, the qualifying round, pre-final round, and finals. The first two are all open-ended, with the pre-final round also having two research questions. A research question simply means that you will need to read a scientific paper in order to complete the question successfully. Also, there are some deadlines/timeframes. The first round, you have plenty of time for, and is due by May 15th this year. The pre-final round you have 1 week to do it, and the final is a 60-min MCQ test.

And yes, there are prizes! They’re only for 1st - 3rd place however, and they are cash. They go from $200-$150-$100, as you go from places 1-2-3. Also, there are regional prizes that may be awarded (a region being something like Europe or America).

Vox media spewing lies,1586479905,"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8584779/moon-illusion

I only managed to get through a portion of this article as the complete negligence to elementary physics here is so obvious that I couldn't even bother after they wholeheartedly state that the phenomena must be a ""psychological effect"" at best. Atmospheric lensing is 100% a reality and is what causes the sunset/sunrise/blood moon coloration changes, these facts are irrefutable. 

I'll make note that the vox media group has some of the best and most well written (and produced with regards to their other media content) stuff on the entire internet. Most of their content allows for commenting, I find it extremely questionable that this article seems to be the sole exception I've seen from their media outlets (I mostly frequent the verge so I don't have too much memory of their other sites' commenting policies). It's material like this, surfacing at the top of the Google search result list for the subject, that promotes the general population asking such questions to start believing in flat-earth bullshit. 

The fact is, it isn't a purely psychological effect. This would violate particle physics as we know it if true. There is NO way to refract light into various spectrums (as anyone who isn't blind can see at least 2x on a clear day during the discolored sunset/sunrise in comparison to the rest of the day) without altering the perceived size and shape of the light source. Does a sun shower make the sun into a rainbow? No, it makes a gigantic (in comparison to the sun itself, array of colors across a portion of the sky that is significantly larger than the sun itself. I'm not refuting that this effect could POSSIBLY be augmented by some sort of psychological based aspect of human perception that causes the effect to be augmented a bit but to state that the angle at which the sun hits the atmosphere DOESN'T in any way alter the size of the object to an observer inside the atmosphere itself is utterly ridiculous to me. 

I'm sorry for the rant, it just seems very sad to me that this sort of thing goes not just unchecked but also is touted as the preeminent source of information on the subject by the best, most widely used, and trusted search engine in the world. Atmospheric lensing is real, there's a Wikipedia page dedicated to it that accurately explains how the effect occurs and how it manages to allow us to see slightly over the horizon. It also explains that the effect can cause the light source in question (be it the sun, moon, or even stars/planets to a certain extent) to become oblong in shape due to this effect. Under the correct atmospheric conditions, atmospheric lensing can and most certainly DOES increase the size of the sun and moon when it is nearing the horizon.

Parallax angle calculation,1586193324,"Hi everyone.

I'm trying to understand how the parallax angle is calculated. I read [this explanation](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/286309/how-is-the-parallax-angle-actually-measured).

So we got that distance between the sun and the star is d = tan(α) \* 1 AU.

That said my doubt is about the angle α. We can calculate this based on the distance of the star that we got measuring it at the distance of 2 AU (based on the length of ω in the image) ? The only thing I can think about is the arc of the circle but I don't think we can draw a circle using that points.

&amp;#x200B;

Also why we need two measurements? Why can't we get the value of α from the triangle created by the parallel as shown in the next figure?

We just need to know where we are compared to the sun. And since (as far as I understand from [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/286309/how-is-the-parallax-angle-actually-measured)) this is purely a measurement of angle I don't understand why we need parallax.

Is gravity just the attraction between protons and electrons?,1586024182,"Firstly.. I am not a physicist and i have not studied physics outside of high school, but I’ve had a thought on gravity and i would love to hear what you guys have to say.

As i understand, neutrons and protons are held together by “strong force”, and protons attract electrons due to their opposite charge.

I have also read that electrons are constantly being stripped from their atom due to external forces, and therefore you have free flowing electrons “searching” for another proton and vise versa. 

If all of matter is made of atoms, then it leads me to imagine all of these atoms are constantly changing their electrons.

If atoms are constantly changing their electrons, and they are constantly being attracted to other electrons.. on a Universal scale.. wouldn’t that force be gravity?

Does either voyager craft have working instruments to test the speed of light outside of the heliosphere?,1585841074,"&amp;#x200B;

My thought comes from thinking of our local spacetime as a bubble, and what it would mean if the sun were effectively governing 'c'.   

When explaining my thought to a friend, I used an analogy of how water refracts, and if we were fish in a pond, every input source from all around us is going through the same level of distortion.  So we may not see the distortion, as we have no reference point to highlight that it is distorted.

In experiments, everything maps out in perfectly rational and measurable and predictable numbers.  So many tests have verified things as accurate, and the lack of conflicting data indicates this is a fundamental limit.  But what if there's no contradiction because no one has done any testing outside of the influence of our good friend, Sol.  And what if the gravitational, electromagnetic, and other forces are conspiring in a manner that limits all local spacetime measurements to what we call 'c'.  

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is my premise flawed?  Is there a mechanism to disprove the possibility that all local measurements are under the same solar influences, and could detect that things were being distorted absent an external observer to validate?

\- How far would Voyager craft need to be from the sun before we noticed lag time (I think it's 34h round trip?)  discrepancies as the suns influence fades? (model 1 = inverse square law, like gravitational forces slowly fading over distance.  model2 = voyager1/2 exiting heliosphere, with a big drop of this influence all at once)

John Lennon famously once said, ""Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans."". If you replace the word life with the word time in his quote, you are left with a good definition of what time is. Time is only a period in the progression of events that was NOT observed by you. So time is the unknown. That's it, that is all it is. People try to make it complicated, when it is not. 

Observation doesn't require extrapolation or guess work as to how events may have unfolded, it is time that does. Time is the unknown because it was unobserved by you. Time is the unknown progression of events that happened somewhere or for something that you were not observing. 

Time is not some currency that must be spent to buy motion or change. The pot will continue to boil whether you observe it or not. Time does not determine where change and motion can occur, it only represents a period of change and motion that went unobserved by you. 

Time does not exist where you ARE observing, it only exists where you are NOT observing. You don't observe a ball progress through time, you observe the progression of change and motion of that ball. Time is what happened somewhere else that you missed out on observing while you were observing the ball instead.

This interpretation makes sense of the notion that time would not exist for God or a supreme being that could observe everywhere and everything all at once. Because if you could observe every object and every location in the universe simultaneously, time would literally not exist FOR YOU. This is because no progression would be missed by your observation, hence nothing would be unknown BY YOU. 

You must understand that there can be two different kinds of time. There is individual time from the perspective of one observer, and there is collaborative time where multiple observers work together to compare notes or combine observations. This means there would be a personal history and a collaborative history.

So from the perspective of an observer in the US, the events that happened in China that he missed out on observing himself would be his individual time. But when the guy from China comes and tells him what happened in China while he was observing the US, and the guy from the US returns the favor, they have now eliminated some time by collaborating and making a collective history. 

So, collaborative time will always be less than individual time, and collaborative documentation of chronology will always be more documentation than individual documentation. You can only document what is KNOWN because it was OBSERVED. 

Chronology documented by observation is what should be called history, because it is known. Extrapolation is not documentation. Your extrapolation or speculation of events unobserved by you will never be as reliable or accurate as the actual observation of those events by others. 

Time is a period of chronology or progression that was NOT observed by you, or by a group of collaborating observers. History is chronology that WAS observed and documented by you, or a group of collaborating observers. So time could be thought of as being the opposite of history. 

It is very important to understand that time and chronology are NOT the same thing. Chronology speaks of causality and order of events. Time speaks of events that were not observed by you. Chronology is like when you number each frame on a film reel. Time would be like if someone cut out a segment of that film reel, spiced it together, and then played that film for you. That missing segment in the film reel represents the concept of time, because some of that chronology or progression of events was unobserved by you.

Chronology is the true progression or the true order of events. It is not your observation, documentation, or understanding of that true order or progression was. Time is just a word, it doesn't do anything, it doesn't cause anything, and it doesn't progress. Time does not represent motion or change itself, and it is not a requirement for motion and change to occur. It is just a word that represents a period of progression that happened somewhere that went unobserved by you alone, or by a group of collaborating observers. 

Entropy is the irreversible elimination of possibilities for a system, that is brought about by the progression of change and motion, not by some boogeyman named time. It is not time that ages you or that causes systems to deteriorate, it is spatial motion of objects and internal change of those objects that does. 

Time is NOT the ""arrow for entropy"" or vice versa. It is CHRONOLOGY that is that arrow. This is because chronology and entropy are things that progress and have a direction. Time does not progress and has no direction. It doesn't make sense to think that a period of unobserved progression can be something that is progressing itself. A period in the PAST cannot change. 

Time WAS the unknown and unobserved progression of events that happened somewhere else. I capitalized the word ""was"" in my previous sentence, because the most important thing for you to understand is that time can only exist in the past. Time does not exist in the present, so it does not exist where you are observing. Time does not exist until AFTER the progression or chronology is completed and you missed observing it. Your lack of observation of that progression is what CREATES time. The only thing that time can measure is a period of your non-observation. 

The ultimate example of CREATING time for yourself is while you sleep. This is because when you wake up you can't be sure of all the changes that may have happened while you were sleeping. Because you weren't observing those things while you were sleeping. So time was being created EVERYWHERE for you while you were sleeping, including where your body was during the progression. Now you must try to extrapolate what happened or ask another observer that was awake. 

Time has absolutely nothing to do with rates or speeds and it is not a dimension. It has to do with lack of observation of the progression of events. You never observe ""time progressing"" or ""experience time"", it is quite the opposite. Time is what you did NOT observe and did NOT experience.

Einstein himself said that time is only a mode of thought and not conditions in which we live. Time is a thought that represents an unobserved period in the PAST. Physical objects or forces in the present cannot change what the past was by curving it, distorting it, or ""slowing it down"". Time is not a speed or rate that represents the speed or rate of progression. So time is not something that can be slowed down. 

Trying to measure time with a clock is no different than trying to measure temperature with a clock. Because neither time nor temperature have rates or represent rates. Every physics equation that involves ""time"", is a misrepresentation of what time actually is. People not understanding the difference between clocks and time is what leads to the belief in ridiculous bullshit such as time dilation. You can't ""dilate"" chronology, because chronology is things that have ALREADY happened.

Noon is called twelve o'clock instead of twelve o'time for a reason. This is because noon describes the position of the hands on a clock, and not the position of time. When the rate of a clock slows down it only means that the rate of a clock has slowed down, it says nothing at all about time. Because a clock was not intended to measure time, it was intended to measure the rate of rotation of the Earth.

Clocks were created to help mankind remain in sync with the Earth's rotation. To help them manage their lives and remain in sync with the day, the night, and with each other. So clocks serve a practical purpose but that purpose is not to measure or represent time. It never IS a time, it only ever is a moment in chronology, or a moment in the progression of change and motion. Past, present, and future are adjectives that describe the placement of moments in chronology, not their placement in time.

So in the equation, s = d/t, you are not really calculating speed against time, you are calculating the speed of one thing against the speed or rate of something else, whether it be a clock or the rate of rotation of the Earth that the clock was intended to represent. Time is not a rate, so it should not be measured or represented by a rate, and it should not be used as a measurement of a rate. Time should only be used as a measurement of periods that went unobserved. 

If your clock slows down when you move somewhere that is causing or experiencing different amounts of gravity than found on Earth, it just means that your clock cannot function the SAME way under DIFFERENT conditions. It doesn't mean that time has ""slowed down"". It just means that you need to re-gear your clock if you want it to turn at the same rate it would on Earth.

That necessary adjustment to your clock doesn't mean anything about time. If you wanted to hit a golf ball on the moon the same distance that you would hit one on Earth, you would have to make an adjustment to how hard you swing your club because of the difference in gravity.

If the rate of your clock slows down when you begin traveling at speeds approaching the speed of light, that also is not evidence of time ""slowing down"". It simply means that the clock must now trade internal motion of its hands for more external velocity across space.

Time = A gap in your observation of the progression of change and motion that occurred in between two known (observed) moments in that progression. Lack of observation CREATES TIME that must later be extrapolated to try to understand how things MIGHT have happened while you were NOT observing. Time only exists where you are not looking so to speak. More precisely, time only exists where you didn't look in the PAST.  Time is the unknown created by gaps in your observation of somewhere or something.

Look, I totally get it, I am a sci-fi nerd too. So I know it is fun and interesting to talk about the ""what if's"" of time dilation and Marty McFly fantasies. But time cannot be changed, because time has already happened, and we missed out on observing it. Science books are not the appropriate place to document our fantasies, things like that should be left to Hollywood. So I say it is ""about time"" to remove from science books these fictitious and illogical descriptions of time, so those pages can instead be filled with a realistic explanation.

Once we do that, we will all then realize that our common goal should be to work together combining our observations to eliminate the enemy of knowledge, that is time.",astrophysics,Logic_is_your_friend,/r/astrophysics/comments/fti5p2/everything_you_think_you_know_about_time_is_wrong/,0

"Are neutrons that come into existence in neutron stars ""normal neutrons""? (read the text please)",1585742609,"A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark (2U+D).
A neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark (U+2D).

As this should be the same as a neutron:
2U+D+e=U+2D (simplify the expression)
U+e=D 
(This makes sense as as if we turn one up quark (of the proton) into a down quark it is U+2D which is a neutron.

Regularity of 'Hierarchy' of Binaries,1585506905,"I've just been looking at some 'choregraphies'  as they tend to be called in the literature: regular (but not usually - if ever - stable) solutions of the equal-mass n-body Newtonian gravitational orbit ... and it's raised a question with me: one the answer to which I've always tended to assume to be in the affirmative ... but now I'm not sure about.

Say there is a pair of binaries; and they are separated by sufficient distance that each is to the other prettymuch as a single body, and the composite system is a therefore a binary of two binaries. Say then there is another such composite 'binary of binaries', and that _these_  two also are separated by sufficient distance that each is to the other as a single body - or more precisely, a 'hard binary' (maybe there's a 'critical' sufficient distance that could be quantified in terms of the internal separations of the binaries chosen to constitue the system). Or maybe it could just be one binary and the other a single body, or a 'lower-level binary. And say this procedure is repeated some number of times, so that the result is a 'hierarchy': the system at any level consisting of two entities each of which is prettymuch a single body at that level. A _self-similar_  system, it would be, with distance-scale increasing roughly exponentially with increasing 'level'. (There might be a proper name for such a system!) And the question is ""would such a system be regular?"".

I'm inclined to think now that such a system _would not_  be regular: that the slight tides felt by each constituent would bring-about a total motion of the system that would _not_  be regular.

However, I reckon it might be possible for such a system to be _stable_  even if it's not regular ... which would be _the reverse_  of what's the case with the 'choregraphies' I mentioned at the beginning , as the creators tend to call them: _they_  are regular but not stable.",astrophysics,PerryPattySusiana,/r/astrophysics/comments/frapav/regularity_of_hierarchy_of_binaries/,0

I have a dumb question,1585022360,"I apologize for my lack of description and any errors as im on mobile and also not as smart as any of you.

As I understand it nothing with mass (or anything?) can exceed the speed of light. But what if you have a very long pole attached to a rotor of sorts (something that rotates) and a large empty patch of space where gravity has minimal to no effect on the contraption. Now rotate the pole and the end connected to the rotor will spin pretty slowly relative to the further end and the further out you go the faster the pole travels. So lets presume you begin spinning this pole at 99.9% the speed of light. Still follows the laws of physics as we know it. But then you extend the pole. So logic would follow that the extension of the pole would either meet or exceed the speed of light. 

Lets assume the pole is a super light material and the engine is powered by a few suns or some futuristic engine capable of producing enough energy needed to accelerate the pole to the achieve the desired effect. I know its not possible at the moment but im sure it will be possible in the future. Either increase the energy output of the engine or extend the pole and at some point it would reach or exceed the speed of light. 

Is there a force that would slow down the pole to the point it doesnt exceed the speed of light? If so what is that force called? Is there anything logically incorrect with this thought experiment that i’m missing?

Can radio waves go through worm holes?,1584664192,"I'm writing a novel, can you help me with the physics of it all? 


In 1999, all over the world portals open up to another earth. 

Only a few people volunteer to go through because 1 day over there is 40 days on our side. 

Worse still, no one knows where the portals came from nor whether they could suddenly disappear, trapping people on the other side. 

Which is exactly what happens to the protagonist, Jada.

My question is, theoretically;

1. Could Jada communicate with her home world, and if so how? Radio waves like in interstellar when they went through the wormhole? 

Could quantum entanglement (albeit theoretically) be use to communicate between the two universes of differing temporalities? 

2. If an advanced alien race were to open portals into an earth similar to ours, how would this play out most realistically?

3. Could humans then learn enough from the portals to build their own or would the amount of energy needed be ridiculously impossible?

What do you think is the reason space expansion is accelerating?,1584188880,"Could this reason also be what caused the Big Bang? I mean ""at some point"" there was an undisturbed singularity, why did it start expanding?

I was thinking perhaps there was something else rising or increasing that at some point was great enough to ""disturb"" this singularity and therefore cause it to expand, and perhaps since this ""something"" continues on increasing, space expansion continues not just on its own, but It's also speeding up. 

Now, this is even more far-fetched but what if at some point this ""something"" that keeps rising will reach a critical limit and start decreasing or evenly suddenly disappear?

"Aspiring sci-fi writer here, I have some questions that I'm hoping you folks can shed some light on.",1583436007,"Hi! I'm writing a sci-fi story, and I'm hoping to get some information on a few aspects of my story. I know I could probably get away with fudging some of these points, but I want to do everything I can to ensure that the story is at least plausibly scientifically accurate.

Note - My scientific background is in Biology, not physics, so please forgive me if I'm thoroughly misunderstanding some points.

1 - The story involves a small group of scientists encountering an alien-made object around the star [Eta Hydrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Hydrae). Now, the star is not only ~7 times the mass of the sun, but it also radiates at 2,680 times the solar luminosity. If I'm understanding this correctly, that means that it is 2,680 times brighter than the sun, right? Does this mean that, in order for the orbiting object to be as well-lit as the Earth, it would need to be 2,680 times farther from Eta Hydrae than the Earth is from the Sun? Or is the relationship between luminosity and distance not linear?

2 - One key plot point involves the object being in a steeply retrograde orbit. Specifically, it's going to hit the star in less than 6 months. This is a plot thing - it's a way of explaining why these scientists have to investigate the object, instead of just leaving it for a more well-equipped expedition. With the distances involved in the first question, is this even possible? 

3 - My last question involves pulsars - specifically, their radio wave output. I'm really just hoping to get some more general information on this subject. As these are radio waves, do they have a sound? If so, what do they sound like? Is it just uniform white noise? Also, how powerful are the radio wave signals given off by a pulsar? Do they give off light as well, or are they confined to the Radio portion of the spectrum? Lastly, are they benign?

Any astrophysicists out there willing to help consult on an animated short film project?,1583428290,"Hello Astrophysics nerds! 

I'm working on a [short animated film](https://www.instagram.com/wowshortfilm/), and there's a moment in the story involving some celestial/orbital mechanics that I'd love to get as ""accurate"" as possible (I put accurate in quotes, because it takes place in a fantastical universe of [tiny planets](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnrBfaBQoO/), a la The Little Prince). I went to film school and have very little knowledge of astronomy, physics, or how orbits work mathematically, but I'd like the character in the film to at least LOOK like he knows what he's talking about. That's where, hopefully, you come in :)

Basically, there is a moment in the film, in a fictional solar system, where a character on one planet wants to predict where another planet will be at a certain time in its orbit, so he can launch himself from his planet to the other. 

We see him first using a telescope to take measurements of where the other planet is from his vantage point, and then later we see his ""lab"" where a chalkboard is filled with the math he would use to figure out the other planet's orbit, and to figure out when and with what sort of direction and force he should propel himself to get to the other planet. So, I'm looking for help designing his process and the props you'd see as a viewer for these two moments. Specically, I'm hoping to answer these questions:

* 1) What would the notes in his notebook look like as he records the other planets movement with his telescope? What sorts of data would he need to determine it's orbit in relation to his planet's orbit?
* 2) What would his diagrams and equations look like on a chalkboard to figure out where the other planet will be in the future? 
* 3) What would the equations look like to figure out how much force and what direction he would need to ""take off"" from his planet to get there? 

I could, of course, just write a bunch of vague scribbles and generic equations and diagrams, but I'd love it if someone who cares about this stuff notices the details as accurate because I love that kind of attention to detail in movies :)

If you're interested in seeing progress on the film, you can check out [our instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wowshortfilm/) , where my wife and I are documenting the process of building miniature planets for use as stop motion sets, with [2D animated characters](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhFEW_Hnq8Q/). It's a really fun passion project that we've been spending our nights and weekends on for the last few years, that eventually will be out in the world in festivals, etc. We have no budget for the astronomy help, but I'm hoping it's just fun and interesting enough that someone with a passion for this sort of thing might be willing to help out in exchange for credit in the film as an Astronomic Advisor (or whatever credit would be fun) and the feel-good feelings of helping a weird little film project be a little more on point scientifically. If that sounds like you, DM me!

"Radial Velocity, Doppler, and the Secret of the Universe",1583340006,"Hey astronomy brothers! 

I recently came face to face with this equation: **radial\_velocity = c \* (the change in wavelength of the absorption lines) / (the true wavelength of reference of the absorption lines), where c is the speed of light.** 

From a few glances at what radial velocity is, it seems that it's the **motion of a star, relative to the point of measurement, on the 'radial line' that extends out from the point of measurement.**

However, when coming face to face with a problem asking me to 'estimate the AU' from using this radial velocity, I got confused. I 'math-ed' out something accurate. But I don't get the conceptual logic behind it. 

I assume that **there is a star, whose absorption lines I have, and that the star is on the same 'plane' as the Earth (and the rest of the solar system). We get the absorption lines from TWO points in time, when the star is at extreme velocities.**

Here in lies my first question: What does it mean when it says 'extreme velocities'? I ended up using (as **you can see in my picture attached)** when the Earth is closest and furthest away from the star. But I do not know why this is the case. The velocity of the Earth is perpendicular to the star at these points, but if I do it this way **we get the right answers.** 

**Now, assuming I use the above as my logic, I then calculate the wavelength change in the two absorption lines. I convert this to angstroms, and use the 'base of the values to compute the ratios. I divide the difference (change in wavelength) by 2, because at one point, the star is 'approaching us', and the other, it's receding away from us.**

Here in lies my second question: I only do that 'divide by 2' because it seems to work. But why is this the case. Why do we consider dividing by two? Is it because the deltas are at opposite periods of 'stretch' in the absorption lines, so that the true change, the true delta, at any given point, is actually **half of the overall measured delta, since the 'ground truth' is in the middle? And if this is so, why is this the case since my first question above deals with exactly how the 'extreme velocities' change the absorption spectra when the velocities are perpendicular to the radial motion?** 

Now, if I do this, I get the **radial velocity of the star. However, I find that if I assume this is also the 'velocity of the Earth around the sun', I get an accurate answer for the AU (through circumference calculation and then getting the radius).** 

**My third and final question is: How can the above be the case? If this is the radial velocity, of the movement of the star 'away' or 'towards' the point of observation, and the Earth moves perpendicular at the points of motion, how can we possibly get this?**

   **I do want to make it clear that the drawings that were being drawn were like what I draw here in this picture. But I think that, in the event that the drawings I have are wrong (IE the Earth is moving 'parallel to the radial lines, so the radial velocity of the star equals the tangential velocity of the Earth around the sun), then this may make more sense. I draw that in my image as well, as the 'alternative' pictures. The angles to the star would be essentially negligible, as the star is so far away. But I'm not sure which is right.**

**Thank you very much for your help!**

Question about light,1583204291,"My understanding is that from the perspective of a photon, it is both emitted (from souce) and absorbed (at target) instantaneously, there is no apparent travel time [Neil degrass Tyson and PBS spacetime].

My question is based on this premise. 

Assume a photon is emitted 1 million light years away and terminates  on a rocketship just in earth's orbit, today.

If the photon both started and ended its journey instantaneously, (1 million years ago from our perspective) does that imply that the rocket always existed? Or that the rocket was always destined to be built and end up in the place where that photon would terminate.

Hi there - My Grandpa is really inquisitive about astrophysics, but never really had chance to study it in depth. He's come up with a few things he'd like to know the answer to before he passes (He's not especially unwell, He's just 98 years old :)  

If anyone is able to answer these questions / queries for him, it'd really mean a lot :)

1. As a neutrino is a mass-less particle, could it pass through a black hole unhindered?  

2. Could dark matter and dark energy be constantly created by the expansion of the universe itself? So when space is stretched by expansion could it release energy like when an elastic band is put under tension and then snaps? Wondering if this could cause a feedback loop by creating the dark energy and dark matter which in itself is causing the universe to expand rather than contract.  

3.  As mass and energy are interchangeable, if there is anti-matter, shouldn't there be anti-energy as well?

What happens with atoms when something collapses into a black hole?,1582403421,"Hey guys!
So I just rewatched a video on YouTube by Minute Physics on how to reach the schwarzschild radius. One of the explanations is that you can simply add mass to an object, and it will eventually reach it. It was explained that the radius of the objects follows a cube root curve whereas the schwarzchild radius follows a linear curve.

So my question is, what happens to all of those atoms when it finally reaches the tipping point? From my understanding the singularity is an infinitely dense place in space time — do the atoms simply collapse into it? Does the gravitational force change so much over atomic distances that atoms are broken down into their elementary particles? 

What about the information stored by those atoms, where does that go? I’ve heard about the information paradox and how Hawking’s last paper might hypothesize a solution to it, but I’ve never really grasped the topic.

Thanks you!

"HI GUYS, IM NOT AN EXPERT BUT COULD YOU JUST READ MY IDEA? THANKS",1582027412,"Ehm I'm not an expert, but I think that some considerations about wormholes, time, and spacetime, must be heard. 

That's this: Ehm. Given that,
a)  Space and Time are not different, are not separated 
b) that spacetime is both a SPECIAL kind of time and a special kind of space
c) there are different kinds of TIME, with different mechanics and different functions and different way of measurement (biological time for matters; particle time that works differently from biological time...) and a special kind of time that is bonded with space creating a both special kinds of space and time called spacetime 
d) the universe is nothing more that the very same SPACETIME 
e) The SPACETIME is just a FABRIC, an elastic one, made of GRAVITATIONAL WAVES. This fabric is constantly and perpetuating in movement in every direction of space. 

So, SPACETIME is composed by gravitational waves, BUT also from EVERY SINGLE MOMENT (I called them FRAMES) of past present and future. 

If the universe is expanding, than we say that SPACETIME FABRIC is expanding. But is expanding nor in the past or in the future times, or in any other region of space. 

Because the material of the SPACETIME are Gravitational waves GENERATED by celestial bodies, than SPACETIME is MODIFIABLE by CELESTIAL BODIES GRAVITATIONAL FORCE. 

Talking about a WHORMHOLE. The Whormhole changes the spacetime, bending it through its force of attraction. 

Well we must consider the whole ""TERRITORY"" occupied by SPACETIME FABRIC with ALL the celestial bodies, with all the time and all the space, in a kind of new geometrical form (I don't know if this form already exists): a SPHERICAL TESSERACT. 
IF this is so, then, the SPACETIME can both continue to EXPAND through unoccupied SPACE and FUTURE TIME, and also EXPLAIN WHY A WHORMHOLE is like a door but just for another region of both another region of the space of the SPACETIME and another MOMENT of TIME of SPACETIME. So is like PAST is continuing to BEING just into another PLACE. Like the past is a place and the future is too. And we are just in a momentary place, while we are ACTUALLY travelling through SPACE (if we are actually moving) and TIME (as our biological body gets oldr and not younger) and through SPACETIME too (as every single millesimal cents of second is like reeaaally really thin layer of AIR like a paint, like a window, that is big as much as our galaxy(?) Until it isn't influenced by another gravitational force's body. 
So the SPACETIME just flows both through us, and step forward from us, in every possible direction.

"If galaxies were closer together than they appear to be, would their apparent mass and motion make more sense without invoking dark matter?",1581995326,"I'm not asking if this conjecture is backed up by observation to date - I'm just asking whether or not the universe would appear and behave a lot less strangely than it does apropo of missing mass and accelerating expansion if, through some unknown property of intergalactic space - some sort of lensing - our observations are being thrown off? That what works in short cosmic distances, say, within a galaxy, doesn't work for intergalactic observations.

Again, I'm not asserting that that is the case, but assume it is. Assume that other galaxies are actually something like 8 times closer than they appear to be.

What was your reason for getting into astrophysics?,1581924995,"This is a little bit of a weird question to ask because it’s not like the answer I’ll receive to that question on face value will be anything shocking. “I like stars” is probably where it ends. The question was more so meant to spark a discussion, albeit for selfish purposes.

I’m 17, thinking about what the future holds for me. Since I was 12, I’ve always been fascinated by two ideas: the idea of being at the forefront of technology, and the idea of understanding. That is to say, the plague of ignorance that’s struck my mind ever since I was a kid has been quite motivating. I’ve never cared too much about stars, but the idea that space is the next frontier, the idea of understanding the universe, and the idea of discovery have been quite seductive. All of those ideas are what the cosmos represents to me.

One of my biggest fears however is the idea of struggling through a bachelors in physics, then a PhD in astrophysics, just to realize that what I thought my field was is wrong but being too engrossed into it to change it.

I guess what this lacklustre life-story is meant to ask is, do your motivations for going into astrophysics even slightly resemble mine? Is the idea of understanding the universe the main driver in you becoming an astrophysicist, and furthermore does that drive alone make up for the fact that you may not care for space in a literal sense?",astrophysics,Smooth_Surfaces,/r/astrophysics/comments/f55914/what_was_your_reason_for_getting_into_astrophysics/,5

The big crunch. Different perspective.,1581803864,"Ok so when I grew up we were told there was a big bang and one day there will be a big crunch.

Then as of late, that was changed to be ""the universe will expand forever"".

I say, why can't there be a big crunch.  It's our perspective that is giving us wrong data (that galaxies are spreading apart faster from eachother).

Here is the best way I can give an example of a different perspective.

Think of yourself on a sandy Beach and you make a pile of sand.  You stick a dynamite into the center of the mound.  We are a grain of sand.  Every other solar system/galaxy is another grain of sand.  You light the dynamite and really slow down time to watch what happens.

(Exaggerated time to try to explain this in writing)...

When the dynamite blows up (the big bang) your little sand grain goes from 0 meters per second to 1 meter per second.  The 1/2 second later as the explosion is happening we go from 1 meter a second to 2 meter a second. 
Another 1/2 a second we go from 2 m/s to 4m/s.  Rinse and repeat.

From our perspective all the other sand grains are speeding up from eachother and we assume we will just keep speeding up from eachother.  When in reality the bang technically is still pushing out until it's over and we slow to a stop.

(Then gravity will take place) and you get the big crunch.

Could it be that our perspective is fooling is and there will be a big crunch in the future? 
We are just in an infant galaxy still forming.

I hope that makes sense.",astrophysics,MiroBeero,/r/astrophysics/comments/f4gh5l/the_big_crunch_different_perspective/,22

"2 civilizations, two different times.",1581611463,"I thought of this last night and here is the best way I can describe it.

Knowing SpaceTime is linked.  Meaning the faster you move through space, the less time moves for you and vice versa.

Let's say there are two planets in a solar system.  Both support life.  

One recolves around the sun faster than the other.
The faster planet even has a faster rotation on its own. (Night and day happen fast).

So does that mean that one civilization ages slower than the other?
If true, One civilization can be technology way more advanced than another civilization.

The same concept can be used with us and another civilization in a totally different solar system.

"Is the ""edge"" of a black hole ""falling"" forever?",1581444587,"When a black hole forms, say from a supernova core collapsing, I imagine it as a sphere of matter contracting (very fast) under its own gravity. At some point the escape velocity becomes faster than *c* and the edge of the sphere passes/exhibits an event horizon, and continues shrinking towards its own centre. (Please correct me if I'm wrong in this thinking!)

My question is, when does this shrinking/falling ever ""stop""? As far as I understand, there is the singularity of zero size and infinite density, but when does it reach those infinities? Is it instead falling forever towards an infinitessimal point? If you could ""zoom in"" to look at the ""core""/singularity of even an ancient black hole, would the ""edge"" still be falling to an ever smaller point, at increasingly higher speed, but never actually getting there?

Or does my question make no sense? Is time too weird? Or because Plank lengths and stuff? Or something else? Not that I claim to understand those things!

Some questions regarding the Big Bang,1581226791,"I recently started reading some (basic) literature on physics and astrophysics. I encountered a couple of assumptions of which i could not quite understand why they would come to such a conclusion. I don't necessarily doubt the validity of their claims, but I would like to understand better why they are conceived as such. So here are 3 questions:

\-   There seems to be a consensus that during the big bang there were almost equal amounts of matter and anti-matter. The two would then quickly consume each-other and a slight imbalance in favor of regular matter is the only reason that there is any left at all. But why is it assumed that there was an imbalance of matter and antimatter? Why would it not be possible that they exist in exactly equal amounts but scattered around the universe in such a way that in some regions where matter was dominant matter-galaxies were formed and in other regions where antimatter was dominant anti-galaxies formed? Not only does this sound like a much more elegant explanation but also doesn't impose the impossible question of why there would be an imbalance between two things that can only appear in pairs. where is the flaw in my reasoning?

\- I have read a statement saying that in the first second of the Big Bang the universe expanded several lightyears in size. How is that possible? That would mean particles were moving more than 30 million times the speed of light! Isn't it supposed to be impossible to go faster than the speed of light? 

\- Why do we assume heavy elements can only be made in stars? sure it makes sense that now those are the only places that are dense and hot enough to facilitate nuclear fusion. However at some point during the big bang the universe must have had similar density and temperature to allow for nuclear fusion to happen? why weren't any heavy elements made during the big bang?",astrophysics,Kiekerjan,/r/astrophysics/comments/f14dfj/some_questions_regarding_the_big_bang/,11

* Wouldn't the more distant version appear directly on top of/in line of sight of the closer by one?

"I work in the space sector after my BsC in CS but want to continue studying Astrophysics, any experiences about this?",1580913474,"21, not US. Last July I finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science. My dream is to participate in space research and exploration. I expected I would have to go through a lot of experience in companies doing web development and stuff like that and get a masters before getting my foot in the industry but I'm happy to say that I am working in a public research institute that collaborates with some international and ESA missions, great stuff, I love it here.

The thing is, despite the fact that I love Comptuer Science and I love what I do here, I can't but feel that I want to study more, something more specific regarding space. Whenever I hear about the ""results"" of the projects I work in or read the presentations of my colleagues about their papers on black holes, neutron stars, exoplanets, etc, etc I just wish I had studied physics as well so that I could understand all that, and not only understand it but participate in that part as well, not just in the computer science below it.

This isn't part of the topic but I really want to leave my country and study somewhere else, so I have already considered some unis and done a lot of paperwork to study a masters in the future, but when looking at it I'm assuming it will be an MsC in Computer Science, and I constantly wonder, should I try to get into a graduate program that's more ""space"" oriented, like astrophysics or aerospace engineering (quite different these two I know).

This is why I come here seeking advice, or experiences, I would say, about people that have taken similar paths and what do they think about it. From what I have read around the internet and heard from colleagues, I think I have a general picture of how the reality is, but again, I can't feel but thinking that I wan't to know more, if not for my career, just out of curiosity.

That is why one of the things I've been considering is studying this on my own, the problem is that obviously that's easier said than done but what worries me the most is that unlike CS, a field in which you could therotically walk up to a company without a degree and proof them that you know what you're doing (and I've met lots of people like this), I don't think anyone would consider me without a degree/PhD in Physics.

I guess if you have papers and research to back you up it can help but doing that on your own...sounds quite difficult. I should also mention that I have co-authored of a paper I wrote with my Bachelor's thesis supervisor about the results of the thesis, in the field of space reseach, although I am very proud of this it was a very ""special/specific"" case. What I mean by this is that if I continue the way I am now (CS guy), I won't probably write any more papers; my work is not research oriented, I am involved in developing the tools so that the physicists at my institution can perform their research.

Furthermore, if I were to try to get accepted into a non-CS graduate program I guess I would have trouble getting in, I don't know to which extend would I be able to deal with this problem by studying the ""fundamentals"" on my own, but I hope this is the case.

As I have mentioned one of the two majors that I am interested in is Aerospace Engineering, while I think I would love to study this I'm afraid I would end up the same way, wanting to know more about how the Astrophysics work at the end, and I'm not sure about which ""combination"" (CS+Astro or CS+Aerospace) would open more doors to participate in big space research and exploration projects.

So, to sum it up a little bit. I want to continue studying, I am not sure if I will love the ""research"" world and to begin with, I'm not even sure about whether I prefer going for something like Astrophysics or Aerospace Engineering, I mean I'd love to do both, but time is limited :( I'm afraid. What is your opinion on this? I was basically wondering what are the experiences of people who have decided (or not) to take similar paths to what I'm considering. Do you think is it even possible for me to pursue a graduate degree in any of these two fields with just a CS background and if so which one would you recommend?

Asteroid Thermal Modeling,1580832874,"Hello Astrophysicists!

My team and I are working on a project which involves determining the Yarkovsky and YORP force and torque vectors on an asteroid. To do so, we need access to a thermal map for the asteroid, preferably an stl file with a temperature assigned to each triangle. Where could I go to find such thermal maps for asteroids? Is there a database for them? Otherwise, how would one go about constructing one?

I am 25 and soon to be 26 in April and looking to potentially go back to college. Originally I wanted to study astronomy and physics back in 2012 and went out to the University of Arizona for college. I ended up giving up quick on the mathematics because I was struggling, mostly because I was 18 at the time and completely unfocused on my education, on top of the fact i was 2500 miles away from home. I ended up transferring to a college back in michigan and graduated in 2016 with a degree in Finance. I have absolutely hated working in finance because I find it extremely boring and would rather be researching, teaching, and doing something in science instead. I recently took a career assessment where it again identified science, research and math as my top interests. 

Do you think I should try to go back to college to be an astronomer and do the 1 thing I have always wanted to do? I have a one year old and wife so things are a bit of a challenge. I just dont see myself every wanting to work in the financial field. And luckily I have no student debt from my past degree.

Questions about Fictional Moons and Planets,1579227471,"I’m trying to write a journal about an explorer who is the first to discover a planet with life. It’s not actually a planet though. It’s a moon called Darkheart because it is the life beneath the shade of its planet. It’s orbiting around a planet that’s actually nearly twice the size of Jupiter. A water planet called Strosse. I realize that a planet of that size being covered in visible water is unlikely, but is it possible? It’d be really interesting to have a volatile impenetrable planet with oceans hundreds of miles deep. Anyways, my question revolves around what life would be like on this moon. Because it’s planet is so large, Darkheart is actually just barely smaller than Earth, and has a thicker atmosphere (for better insulation). I’m hoping a regular orbit would be about 2-3 months so I can make a practical hibernation cycle or something of the sort. What is a reasonable orbit speed? How often would this planet be freezing (I suppose that would also have to take into account the planet’s rotation)? How often would it be warm? Would this planet still be habitable. Would the thick atmosphere be enough to make the temperature fairly consistent? Any ideas for how I could improve this world or perhaps even make it more interesting? Are there other factors I’m not considering? Like meteors, magnetic fields, distance from star, etc.?

If we take a planet with lots of moons such as Jupiter.  These moons orbit in the same direction, but should two moons orbits cross, would they collide or would gravity between them (and Jupiter) prevent collision?

If a collision did occur, what would happen to the moons?  (ie. would they join; would they break apart; would they remain in orbit; would they fall into the planet; etc)

Is it possible to calculate when moon-moon interactions may occur in the future?

Is it possible for spacetime to have an extra spatial dimension that is large?,1578753295,"Would physics break?

It would allow separate frames of reference to scale ..we know it is doing this because the speed of light is the same in time dilation volumes. Gravitational waves fluctuate the scale of reality as they pass. It could make cosmic voids expand and black holes contract.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Four LARGE spatial dimensions means anything that spreads out 'spherically' will follow an inverse cube law, not an inverse square law.

This is interesting because I think it explains how a black hole is started. A giant star collapses in on itself into the 4th dimension using the inverse cube law. You would need the force of a collapsing star to interact with the fourth dimension.

What does the information paradox say about matter being sent to a 4th dimension? If a black hole is partially 4D ..that would be hard evidence that it is there. Do cosmic voids have something to do with 4D? It seems when a volume doesn't have mass ..the 4d spatial spacetime is collapsing in on itself to cause voids to expand?

Is gravity considered weak because mass from 3D objects that we can interact with and see is barely anything to a 4D spatial spacetime fabric? A black hole would be 4D mass and spacetime would do the opposite of cosmic voids.

C,1578589147,"Hello 🖖

I have no physics background so I apologize if this is common knowledge among you.

I was wondering why it is that we assign a value to the speed of light as a constant if at the same time we argue that the universe is expanding.

If the fabric of space is expanding, then isn't the medium through which light travels expanding, causing it to ""appear"" slower or faster from our perspective depending on which direction it's moving?

For example, if we measured it's speed moving towards the universe's point of origin and away from it, would we not see two different results? If true, then isn't the average of those two as close to C as we can get? Or is this how we already do it?

Maybe the expansion of the universe is where I have it wrong, but the same would apply I assume even if it's expanding from many places at once, like the dispersing of food coloring in those bowl experiments.

The Primary Elements,1578351798,"Before anyone gets pissed off, this is just a theory of mine. And if it already exists then cool. 

My hypothesis is that, much like colours and numbers, we have prime elements: pure light and pure dark. 

Everything in our world was created through the fusion of light and dark. So maybe it’s not an element in the sense that we understand it, but then again we invented the word element to understand elements. 

Pure light is the element and pure dark is the plane/vacuum within which it’s held. Once it first exists, lights primary directive is sustainability; and so it attaches to the most dense element, which is darkness. From there, much like life, it evolved by trial and error of expansion... and thus created new degrees of light. 

Eventually the new degrees of light started interacting with one another and fusing to create new entities, becoming different shades of light until it developed a pattern of sustainability. Following this pattern it began to continue doing the same things until it realized that the result wasn’t going to be sustainable, so one of the light combinations changed slightly to create a more stable environment. 

Because they lived in the vacuum which we describe as the universe, they had to adjust so that they could slowly grow with and within the vacuum... any energy that became too light broke through the vacuum because light in its purest form has no matter and can’t perceivably be contained. (much like air). As the light forms began to mutate, they realized only so many of the same light forms could exist in the given space if they all held the same density, so they kept adjusting the light forms until finally the first colour was formed, however dull it could have been. 

This shift in density began to mutate until it finally realized that by changing hue it could absorb the light in different ways and by continued merging with other light entities so that it could survive - this creating matter through light density. Like the Fibonacci sequence, once you absorb something else’s density, you take on its properties in a symbiotic nature so that you can expand the vessel. The denser it is, the less it can absorb, and so naturally it becomes brighter as the energies it’s absorbed interact and excite each other. 

Once it reaches the most stable point it can be, it becomes a sun, and that sun is the elemental building block for the planets in its orbit. It brings them into its rotation so that it can continue to create energy and pass it along to other entities. If it does continues to do this with no entities to pass it along to, because you can’t reflect if there’s nothing to catch the reflection, it collapses in on itself and creates a black hole, because the density became so high that the light then again becomes dark. The dance of the cosmos is the exchange of energy between stars and then from the stars to the planets and the planet to its inhabitants for them to use. If you don’t use the energy, and allow it to build up, then the planet heats because it can’t control how much light the sends it’s way. 

In such, the very nature of the universe is that we’re all made up of light and dark. More evolved planets are now part of the co-creation process by becoming light enough to travel between planets and solar systems using the two universal elements of light and dark. It’s all of our job to make sure that we keep our planet as stable as we can because any large energy shift could have grave effects on the entire energy exchange of the universe.

When you think of it from an alchemical standpoint rather than a “traditional” scientific theory - it becomes very plausible. Now... what was the energetic piece that set it in motion? God? Another universe? Who knows. Isn’t it exciting to think it could bring us one step closer to figuring it out though?!!

Possible near earth solution for exoplanet imaging,1578279043,"Hey everyone! I'm an Electrical Engineer with a decent background in aerospace, astronomy, etc and I recently read [this research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08421) where they discussed using the sun as a gravitational lens to image exoplanets in far greater resolution than is currently feasible. However one of the main hangups of the idea is that it requires sending multiple satellites to distances just on the edge of our solar system, which will take a long time and make it incredibly slow to communicate with and receive data back from the satellites. 

This led me to think that there is no reason that other *extra*\-solar masses couldn't potentially be used as the ""lens"" in place of our sun since as the paper points out, there is not a single focal point but rather a focal line that should technically be infinite in length (although i'm sure that's not the practical case). So in other words, is there a reason why we wouldn't be able to use a distant large star or even a black hole that happens to create a line between the earth and the exoplanet we wish to image? That way we wouldn't have to spend a lot of time and money to send satellites to an area on the edge of the solar system.

A theory for dark matter,1578243205,"Originally I was writing a paper about why I believe that parallel dimensions do not exist. The basis for this theory was that because gravity is a constant and can affect almost anything including mass, light, and even time I theorized that gravity would also affect objects not in its own dimensions-if not slightly watered down or lessened-. And because we are not feeling the effects of this gravity from invisible parallel dimensions therefore these extra dimensions do not exist.

Then I realized that it is possible that we do feel these effects. 85% of the gravity that is holding our galaxies together is not accounted for and we do not know where it originates, the current theory for this is dark matter. An invisible mass with great amounts of gravity holding together our many galaxies. But I believe that it is possible that this dark matter does not exist but is instead the gravitational force of many planets and stars inside of parallel dimensions.

I went to see the doctors last year and he was reading up on it at the last minute (As I walked in). He said he'd contact a neurosurgeon and discuss it and see if I could get an appointment there.

Onto the actual question.

Since there are two virtual particles generated but one flies off and the other enters the black hole, adding it's very small mass to it, doesn't that mean the black hole should only gain mass since the virtual particles were ""freshly generated"" and never part of the black hole before that?",astrophysics,DoomCookiee,/r/astrophysics/comments/ejptv3/question_about_hawking_radiation/,24

1. Ultimate beings (the Trinity)
 - ability to MANIPULATE time like freeze it, slow it down, fast forward etc.
 - physical travel might be much faster than speed of light


2. Supreme beings (their incarnations)
 - ability to physically MOVE themselves through time,backwards or forwards
 - physical travel at around speed of light 


3. Bulk beings (highly developed humans/aliens)
 - ability to SEE through time, backwards or forward.
 - physical travel less than speed of light but more than speed of sound.


4. Human beings (Us)
 - No time related abilities. Can only use time as it is and maybe bend it a little bit. XD
 - physical travel less than speed of sound.


5. Primitive beings (what we were at the start of stone age)
 - same as human beings in terms of time.
 - physical travel at even less speed than that for human beings.



6. Thoughtless beings (what we were before stone age)
 - time usage simlar to that of both above
 - physical travel same as primitives


7. Fauna (aquatic worlds, dinosaurs, reptilian worlds etc)

I'm not a professional physicist but I'm deeply interested in science, especially astrophysics and cosmology, so don't be afraid to get somewhat technical because I would really like some answers.

Based on what I could grasp from the paper the evidence seems pretty compelling. To be 100% honest, I don't want the team to be correct, because after believing the universe was flat, and thus infinite for most of my life a closed universe seems kind of boring, although I know that is a crude and unscientific way of thinking. My question is how compelling do you think the paper is? Is the evidence compelling enough to you to cast strong uncertainty on the (as far as I can tell) mostly accepted current view of the universe being basically flat on cosmic scales? Do you think it's more likely that the universe is actually curved or is there some sort of flaw or error in the model proposed by the study?

Also, does a positively curved universe honestly constitute a serious ""crisis in cosmology""?

Potentially stupid question from someone with no math background or even ability,1576970304,"Alright so I've been thinking about this for a long time.  The big bang strikes me as something very unusual--something that can come out of nothing.  IT's paradoxical, unless we alter the parameters of what we believe is possible, in other words, we add more data.  


But what if it came out of something, just something we can't see into?  


What if our universe blew into existence when a black hole in in a 3 + x dimension compressed mass to an infinite amount in that higher dimensional space space?  


Here's my thinking:  


A black hole condenses mass into an infinitely dense amount.  But what if it did it in an uneven fashion?  Most black holes are rotating or have some kind of directional velocity.  Most black holes, I think, are discs, right?  


If the matter compressed at an uneven amount the dimension we consider ""height"" would be packed to infinite density first?  Maybe femtoseconds before the other dimensions?  But as soon as that transformation happens, you have an infinitely small mass that, potentially, has a non-infinitely small value along other planes.  At which point, maybe that black hole appears in a lower dimension (or creates a universe with properties equal to less dimensions of freedom) and what would be \*incredibly dense\* but not infinitely dense mass, would explode outwards so quickly that they literally break their own physics in order to re-assert their own physics.  


Can someone tell me where I've gone wrong?   I assume I am, I just...lack the mathematical background to detect it.

I think the most likely explanation of where I'm wrong would be to suggest that, if a black hole is creating our universe, and black holes continue to evolve (eat more mass over time) we might expect our universe to be potentially still growing in absolute mass, like it's fountain or something--that would mean there is a white hole at the centre of the universe?  I dunno.  This is where my ability to conceptualize this stuff basically ends.  Or maybe the universe is made out of a discrete amount of mass, and then other universes are created from subsequent events?  I dunno.

Part of my thinking was do they calculate the effects of each star (obviously not EVERY star, but likely  points representing the mass of closely located stars) on the stars near and far to it. I was thinking could the stars near the perimeter of the galaxy all attract the ones near them along the perimeter and a bit into the galaxy and create a metaphorical belt around the galaxy, allowing it to spin a bit faster?

I'm not sure how much the difference in mass calculated is, and if this would make up for that all, but I've gotten myself really curious with this.

If gravity is the warping of spacetime around a massive object (the sun) and less massive objects (earth) are falling in a straight line toward it in that warped spacetime what causes our orbit to be elliptical instead of circular? 
Is spacetime not warped uniformly around the sun? Or is there some part of all this I'm just not getting?

As black holes come into contact with other black holes, they implode, then explode out.

Blackhole Firewall Thought and Question(s),1576166267,"As a warning, this may simply come down to me having a lack of understanding on how black hole horizons exist in space, so fair warning it could all be a bogus thought BUT trying to better understand:

Thought Experiment: 

So, say I was able to place my left eye (and left side of my body) on the inside of a black hole's event horizon, the other on the opposing side. Also imagine I have enough force in my ""Iron Man suit thrusters"" to keep me exactly positioned on the event horizon (I know, this is extremely unreal, BUT so is reaching a black hole in this century so bare with me)

Questions: 

Would i see my left side stretch and contort into the singularity from the perspective of my right eye? 

What if my body is orbiting the singularity at the speed of light, to which my contorted body will remain behind me in my orbit since once passed the horizon it can no longer move freely in space? 

Would this cause any pain considering ""Einstein's happiest thought"" of which your ""clone"" can live happily in a large enough black hole? 

Will my right side feel the pain associated with the left's burning but my left feel nothing? If this needs clarification I am happier to provide

Anyone want to have a deep discussion?,1574723652,"With the epic scale of size from large to small in our universe; from quarks to our observable universe, we find ourselves at a reference scale of 5 to 6 feet. 
When you go smaller with biology you get to cells which are significantly smaller than us. When you go larger however, we stop considering the different ways in which life in the universe can come about.

What im getting at is that i think that our earth is a collective organism in its own way. Everything we consider to be alive is a part of our planet. Our planet and sunlight grew our bodies, and every living plant and animal came to be through the very elements given to us by our planet. So as a whole Its alive.

You can also say that stars and galaxies are maybe not typical life but are alive and experience time the same as we do. 
Theres a certain consciousness to existing in the first place i think. 
However to quote Neil Tyson ""perhaps our human brains arent capable of understanding the answers to the very questions were smart enough to pose.""
But in conclusion i feel like the universe is alive or is part of something beyond human measure. For were too small to grasp the true scale. 
Like the cells in our bodies, floating around in and time and medium, so is our universe a small part of something grander, floating around microscopically in an unknown medium and experiencing time just the same

My hypothetical solution would be that he has to jettison and detach everything from the ship down to the bare necessities. The jettisoning is sort of essential to my story as it serves as a the completion of his character arc (symbolic for letting go, etc). *Anyway-* would that actually work? Additionally- I was wondering if a ship was traveling as fast as it possibly could go, would it hypothetically make sense to jettison the engine under the circumstances above? I know that question is a bit ridiculous but I wanted to emphasize that my character would rather be stranded in deep space with no engine than get absorbed into the stretchy void- so hypothetically if a ship was traveling at its maximum capacity, would it do it any favors by dumping the mass in the engine itself?

"If chemical elements at the surface of a star also emit photons when de-excited, why are there absorption lines in starlight?",1573860488,"Hey there,

When an atom, say of Hydrogen, absorbs light of specific wavelengths, its state gets excited to a higher energy level. When it goes back to the lower energy level, it emits light of that same wavelength.

What I understand is that the reason light coming from stars like our sun have absorption lines is that the surface of the star is bombarded by photons of different wavelengths, but the atoms at the surface absorb photons of wavelengths corresponding to the emission/absorption wavelength of the various chemical elements.

Here is my question: let's take all the hydrogen atoms at the surface of the star. Wouldn't be that at some point: all those hydrogen atoms would move to the higher energy state and hence stop absorbing any radiation (and hence not creating any further dip in the outgoing radiation). Alternatively, if those hydrogen atoms get back to the lower energy level, wouldn't they re-emit a photon at the same previously absorbed wavelength.. If we average this on the xillions of atoms at the surface of the star, shouldnt it all cancel out and thus leaving no gap in the star's spectrum?  


Where does the unbalance that makes starlight have absorption lines come from?

The solar system is a 3rd generation star, meaning it went through this process at least twice. But as far as we know, the closest black hole is thousands of light year away.

I Believe I Discovered the True Shape of the Universe,1573325002,"So I believe I may have an idea about how the universe is shaped.  If it is in fact a sphere (new evidence shows it may not be flat), we would wonder about what's on the edge, right? The idea of the universe being infinite always made my brain error out. Almost as if assuming infinity was incorrect.  Same things happens when I imagine an edge. What's on the other side? What could it all be?

  Well, i found a solution that doesnt cause my brain to ""short circuit.""  The universe is not infinite. But! It also has no edge.  How?  Think of it like pac-man.  When you reach the ""edge"" you simply relocate yourself onto another position in the game. It's not a true edge and it's not infinite because it's the same space.  

Maybe the universe is a multifdimensional sphere that has no edge. No matter which direction you choose, you will end up at your starting point.  That's how you cheat infinity. You can infinitely move in one direction but the space itself isnt infinite.

If you think about it.. even the symbol of infinity shows this. It's not a line that goes on forever, it's a space that travels to ITSELF forever. No edge. Yet not continuously new.

What does a Galaxy truly orbit around in this scenario?

Now let’s say that there is a black hole system with a two black holes, one bigger than the other. Let’s call the larger one BhA, and the smaller one BhB. BhB orbits BhA due to BhA being more massive. But because gravity doesn’t just work only in one direction, BhA is continually nudged towards BhB, causing the two black holes to essentially orbit a center of mass for that solar system.

Now if that Black Hole system happened to be what the entire galaxy orbited around, what would the galaxy truly orbit around? Is it the center of mass for that Black Hole Solar system, or is it just BhA?

"Hi, r/astrophysics. I may have found a lead on antimatter - but I need some fact-checking.",1573003334,"I've been recently looking at a LOT of astrophysics research. This is only a handful of what I wrote down in the last few days, but I want to know your thoughts on the idea at hand, and whether or not I'm getting something blatantly wrong here - or potentially on to something?

Since a lot of astrophysics appears to be theoretical, take my thoughts with a grain of salt please.

&amp;#x200B;

Right, here's an excerpt from my notebook:

`Potential ties to Hawking Radiation &amp; Black body Radiation -`

`The ""evaporation"" when regular matter is no longer able to be taken into the black hole may be likely from antimatter / gamma rays (alongside other EMR) releasing from a black hole after the regular matter, which is what's stored inside of a black hole, is converted into antimatter and pure photon energy (again, potentially gamma EMR).`

`In short, a black hole ""could"" just be some sort of antimatter generator that eats up normal matter and converts it into what Hawking coined to be ""black-body radiation"", or what I consider EMR and antimatter.`

`The ""singularity"" of a black hole may simple be the regular mass in the process of being converted to the aforementioned EMR and antimatter.`

`This particular idea seems to be relevant to Newton's Third Law of Motion. It also supports the law of Conservation of Mass-Energy.`

&amp;#x200B;

Another excerpt from my notebook shows that `gravitational pull may be caused by electromagnetic radiation`, I wanted to throw this out there because there seems to be no plausible explanation as to how gravity is even made, besides ""simulating"" gravity through the use of contra-rotating habitation units.

&amp;#x200B;

With my research, I also tend to factor in Einstein's Special Relativity theory &amp; theories related to quantum mechanics.. the scariest term known to mankind, and the already-suffering physics students.

If you desire my full writings &amp; ideas that I've thrown out thus far, let me know - but it is a big jumbled mess. I am autistic and I think &amp; write things down very oddly. It is the best way for me to write down everything that comes to mind, right off the bat, instead of trying to formulate it into neat writing.",astrophysics,konichiwah89,/r/astrophysics/comments/ds8ylo/hi_rastrophysics_i_may_have_found_a_lead_on/,11

&gt;*One set of observations showed that there was more gravitational lensing – stretching of the light due to the shape of space-time, which can be distorted by heavy matter – than expected. Alessandro Melchiorri at the Sapienza University of Rome and his colleagues calculated that this could be because the shape of the universe is different from what we thought.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*All other cosmological data suggests the universe is flat, meaning it has no curvature, similar to a sheet of paper. These Planck measurements indicate that it could be “closed”, or spherical, which would mean that if you travelled far enough in one direction, you would end up back where you started. That is because the extra lensing implies the presence of extra dark matter, which would pull the universe into a finite sphere instead of a flat sheet.*

Quite an interesting read this morning, though it's not yet clear if it's just a statistical fluke.

Advice regarding astrophysics as a hobby.,1571085343,"Maths and physics weren't my strong skills in high school (I somehow did really well in chemistry and biology though) but despite that I've become more and more interested in astronomy and astrophysics during the last 4 years.

I've attended lectures and signed up for beginner astronomy and astrophysics classes but I always feel the need to know and understand more. 
The only think keeping me back is that I've always been bad at math and haven't had any practice since I graduated high school (the field I chose to study and specialize in has nothing to do with math or science) so I'm very self-conscious about it. But I suppose you can only get so far without math.

Writer with a Question,1570742844,"I'm currently working on a series of short stories that take place over the course of 10,000 years as the earth's rotation slows and eventually stops. A being outside our universe is intentionally slowing it, though humanity is unable to see or interact with it.

My question is would the moon revolving around the earth change in any meaningful way over the course of those 10,000 years? If I understand correctly, the moon would start getting closer to the earth due to the decrease in tidal friction, but I guess I'm under the impression that would take a long time (like, 100,000s of years). My hope is that the moon will still go through its phases in roughly the same timeframe as they do today because I would like to use the phases to indicate the passage of time.

Please let me know if I'm mistaken, and thank you so much for any and all replies. I'm also all ears on thoughts concerning what I might need to address. All I've incorporated so far is an artificial atmosphere and city-sized domes. The atmosphere's purpose is to keep wind currents and such operating as normal, and the dome's are to create comfortable temperatures and weathers for humans to exist in.

[MOD ANNOUNCEMENT] New Mods and Moving Forward,1570384789,"#New Mods

Hello again everybody. After my last post I got a lot of high quality responses from people interested in being mods and from that group I've picked out four people to fill out the mod team here. I may add one or two more this week. 

I intend to review my decisions in approximately 90 days and make any changes that are necessary, for example on the slight chance that someone never shows up or does something that concerns me they will be replaced. For that reason I'm going to keep a list of the applicants I didn't choose and if I need to make adjustments I will pull from that list. A big thank you to everybody who sent me messages. There were more qualified people than there were slots to fill. The community here needs people who are willing to step up and help out and you guys did that. Thank you everybody.

Here are the new mods in alphabetical order:

/u/Hary1495 is a 3D graphics designer by profession and a photographer by hobby. He works with CGI and video games environment designs most of the time and when he is free from work, he is up all night shooting the night sky with camera and telescope. He absolutely loved astrophotography for years and that's what got him hooked into discussions related to space and space science. He has read a lot on the topic ever since and easily gets drawn into such discussions regardless of it's technical level, and he's looking forward to reading what's posted here! 

/u/jwkennington is a physics/astrophysics undergrad looking to go to graduate school. 

/u/mfb- is a particle physicist with an interest in astrophysics.

/u/WildAstroboy is currently an undergraduate studying to be an astronomer or astrophysicist, not quite sure which direction yet who enjoys talking about the cosmos. He also posts on Reddit as /u/vawn. 

Once everybody gets their feet under them we're going to work on filling out the sidebar and the wiki (we'll need help for that probably), and getting some flairs for students and professionals in the field. 

#Subreddit Growth

Right now we're averaging 307 unique users visiting daily on a subreddit with 17,000 users, a uniques-to-users percentage of just 1.8%. That's quite low. To give you an idea here are the numbers for this subreddit and a few other smallish enthusiast subs I have details for:

/r/telescopes: 27,000 users, 1,700 uniques (6.2%)

/r/Starlink: 12,000 users, 870 uniques (7.3%)

/r/ULA: 6,400 users, 480 uniques (7.5%)

Uniques aren't everything, but in terms of visitors this subreddit has been gutted due to the horrible mod policies of the past several years. I think with community engagement we should be able to double the number of uniques we get within 90 days, easily. We don't need new subscribers right now, we need the ones we already have to come back here. 

Start posting and start talking, people; we're counting on you. 

#The Wiki

In previous posts, some people expressed interest in building out a functioning and informative wiki. /u/TheSilverNiko took the initiative to come up with a reading list and that's now the best and only thing on [the wiki](www.reddit.com/r/astrophysics/wiki), but we need more. If you have ideas about the kind of stuff that should be there. or are available to help add to it, please speak up. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a high quality resource to point people to? Wouldn't that help attract people here and give us a better community?

Theory on dark energy basically,1570352768,"So I'm by no means involved in this subject typically, so i could be thinking stupidly, but I'm interested to see opinions about my theory.

Is it possible that there are 2 linear forces for matter, one is a pull, and the other is a push BUT there is a very subtle difference in how distance affects the linear angle of them so much that we see the curvilinear ""gravity"" arc that we know?

If that is possible, then i could see how at some vast distance from matter, the pull becomes weaker than the push and that's where we see galaxies spreading instead of coalescing.

Recommended Resources Suggestions,1569875090,"Hey everyone, I've compiled this list of recommended resources that will be going in the wiki. If you have any suggestions for additions, corrections, or general suggestions comment them and I will integrate them.  

**Recommended Resources on Astrophysics**

There are many types of resources that can teach you a lot about Astrophysics. Below is a list of different resources ranked by difficulty. 

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

**Beginner Books:**

1. Tyson, *Astrophysics for People in a Hurry,* 2017. This was the book that personally got me into Astrophysics. It is very easy to read and requires no prior knowledge to understand. It begins with the beginning of the universe, and then covers a lot of the most interesting and basic concepts in Astrophysics. 
2. Asimov, *Isaac Asimov’s Guide to Earth and Space,* 1992. This book is pretty easy to read as well. It provides answers to the most common and interesting questions in both Astronomy and Astrophysics. 
3. Sagan, *Cosmos,* 1980. This book is probably the most classic in its genre. It is the book form of the TV show and is illustrated beautifully. It gives a great introduction to Astronomy which is one of the foundations of Astrophysics.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

**Intermediate Books:**

1. Hawking, *A Brief History of Time,* 1988. This is absolutely my favorite Physics book of all time. It focuses mainly around Cosmology and covers everything from Space-Time, The Uncertainty Principle, Elementary Particles and Forces, Black Holes, and everything in-between. Though it was designed to be readable to everyone, I think a decent understanding of Physics/Astronomy is needed to fully comprehend the book and its vocabulary. It contains many diagrams and illustrations that make the concepts easier to comprehend but it is still not the easiest read. 
2. Hawking, *The Universe in a Nutshell,* 2001. The Universe in a Nutshell was written as a successor to A Brief History of Time and approaches similar concepts with the knowledge that we have gained since A Brief History of Times publication. 
3. Tyson, Strauss, Gott, *Welcome to the Universe,* 2016. This is a more recent book that is much easier to understand than Hawking’s works but still valuable nonetheless. It is based on a course that was taught by the authors at Princeton. It provides a decent general picture of the Universe but the vocabulary and concepts it introduces are intermediate level. That is why, in my opinion, I put it in the intermediate category. 

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

**Enthusiast** **Resources**

Up until this point I have only provided books that a person with a little interest can read. In this section I will list some resources that someone with a strong interest in Astrophysics and a strong grasp of Mathematics, and Physics might be interested in . 

1. MIT Open Courseware. If you haven’t heard of MIT Open Courseware by now, you’ve been missing out. It is essentially free video lessons from professors at MIT. [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=science&amp;subcat=physics&amp;spec=astrophysics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=science&amp;subcat=physics&amp;spec=astrophysics) If you scroll through this link you will see a list of courses on Astrophysics that are at undergraduate and graduate levels. There are multiple websites like these from different universities, but my favorite is MIT’s. 
2. Carroll, Ostlie, *An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics*, 1996. This book is huge, this book is expensive. It is written at an Undergraduate level but it can be a fantastic read for people with huge interests in the field. It covers every area of Astrophysics but again, it is expensive and very long. 
3. Choudhuri, *Astrophysics for Physicists,* 2010. Again, long, expensive, but informative. It provides a general overview of Astrophysics at an upper level undergrad/early grad level. It should be readable to someone who is a very enthusiastic amateur with a strong knowledge of math and physics.

At this level there are a ton of books that are focused on a specific area of Astrophysics but I have decided to exclude them from this list. 

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

There are other countless video series on YouTube that can also be helpful to beginners as well. Space.com is also great at providing the latest news in Astronomy, Physics, and Spaceflight.

"[MOD ANNOUNCEMENT] The trolling is over, /r/astrophysics is back to being a science forum, we're looking for moderators, and this post is an invitation to talk about the direction this sub should go.",1569736791,"Hello everybody. You may have noticed a few changes here over the last two weeks. We've been in transition. This goal of this post is to:

1 - solicit volunteers to be mods here

2 - open the floor to anybody who wants to complain about or compliment the subreddit, suggest changes, ask questions, etc. 

Over the past several years /r/astrophysics has been under control of a group of mods that used the subreddit as their own personal urinal. You can read a little bit about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophysics/comments/2v1wkg/what_happened_to_this_subreddit/). 

Recently, the top mod got tired of doing it, booted everybody else, and [put out a call for people to take over the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophysics/comments/czev7p/actual_serious_astrophysics_update/). Given my interest and experience moderating relevant subreddits, [I was selected](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophysics/comments/d74ase/actual_serious_astrophysics_update_2/) and am now the only mod. Beside my application to mod here, I have no connection with any of the former group. All the mods responsible for the problems over the last several years are gone, and that means we need new ones and that's where you come in.

This subreddit needs new mods with an interest/degree/job in astrophysics plus one or more of the following qualifications:

 - experience with CSS and/or subreddit themes

 - experience making and administering flairs

 - a willingness to create and maintain an up-to-date sidebar

 - interest in taking the lead on subreddit community initiatives related to astrophysics

If you have any of those qualifications and would be interested in moderating /r/astrophysics, please [send modmail](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fastrophysics) explaining your qualifications and strengths with respect to the above list, and what if any vision you would like to see achieved here. More effort in the modmail will get your name more consideration.

I dont know if its all worth it in the end i really love physics but im afraid that ill mess up with all the math and stressful learning times that are associated with the subject although i have alot of free time while serving so i could start learning in my free time.

Should I pursue a degree in Astrophysics?,1569631484,"  

Hello!

I am currently in the process of applying to uni and am struggling to decide between astro and electrical engineering. I have a desire to learn how the universe works and am really fascinated by space hence, why I am considering astro. However, I don't know if I'd want to do astrophysics as a career as I have no clue if I'd want to complete a PhD or if I'd like an academic job. Further, from what I've heard astro jobs are hard to come by. Also, I know that jobs exist for MSci Astro students but what worries me is that many seem to be in finance or business data analysis and such, fields in which I have no interest, I'd prefer a more engineering/technical job should I not pursue a PhD.

Electrical engineering on the other hand also seems very interesting, albeit a bit less than learning about the workings of the universe. However, what attracts me to this is firstly, the career areas. The electrical grid, RF/mobile communications, photonics/ lasers, satellite design and even science fields such as the design of the LHC or space probes. Secondly, I also like the fact that the career prospects seem a bit more certain in the sort of areas I find interesting, and they only require a BEng/MEng. Finally, should I still have a desire to do physics I could do a PhD on optics or photonics. 

Even though I feel that electrical engineering is the safer option (I also find it really interesting, I'm not solely saying it’s a safety choice) considering my concerns, I still get moments where I have a deep desire to understand complex physics. Maybe with the maths and physics background I gain if I were to do EE, I could learn much of this in my spare time and get into amateur astronomy. Any thoughts on any of this or my reasoning would be much appreciated! 

Also, in the country I'm applying to engineering physics is virtually non-existent, you pick your degree before entering uni, you can't generally take modules outside your course and you can't do minors.",astrophysics,Katim20029,/r/astrophysics/comments/da95qp/should_i_pursue_a_degree_in_astrophysics/,10

"Okay, so, I'm currently creating a fantasy world for P&amp;P roleplay with friends and I was thinking of also creating a reasonable solar system for this world to pep it up a bit.",1569179410,"Basically I took the Alpha Centauri system and replaced Alpha Centaury A and B with a Class F white-yellow-ish star of their combined mass. 

I am aware of the UV-problem but I thought that a binary system might fuck up the climate (would it?).

I also put Proxima Centauri a bit closer. It would be cool if it was distinctable from the other stars at night on the planet (meaning it would probably be a bit brighter than Proxima) but I guess you won't be able to see it during daytime at all.

From my laughable research I considered that a radius of about 2 AU would be best for earth-like climate on my planet when orbiting a star like this.

There would be also a few other planets orbiting the star, there should be at least one gas giant (absorbing asteroids and stuff) and a few others for fun. I excluded them, because they don't have to fit any criteria.

I guess the orbital period of 390 Earth-days on my planet could be problematic. Does it leave the orbital velocity to fast to be realistic?

Also, do Class F stars even exist long enough to form planets that cool down and become habitable?

I hope my basic idea works out and my sketch is understandable. Thank You!

Calculating sub-satellite point from Keplerian elements,1567180401,"Hi there

The other day I've been trying to calculate (or: approximate) the sub-satellite point of a geostationary satellite from the Keplerian elements obtained from a TLE dataset using MATLAB (or any other programming language). I've found some hints but couldn't manage to calculate it. I think my problem was the factor *time,* I'm sure there must be *time* anywhere in the equations but I couldn't handle it. I read about the Greenwich Hour Angle playing a role.

My approach was to go from the Keplerian description to XYZ, then to XYZ ECEF, and then to lat/lon.

Does anyone here have a straight-forward solution for calculating it? Or does anyone know another reddit community where I could ask?

Is it possible to artificially increase the spin of a black hole?,1567059178,"So I watched a video by veritasuim about r-isco. He was talking about how the faster the spin of the black hole, the smaller r-isco is, and that if r-isco were to equal the radius of the black hole (touch the event horizon), it would mean that light is able to escape and thus, leave a ‘naked singularity’.

So I was wondering, is this actually possible? Or is it completely theoretical. 

If it is, can we possibly induce a faster spin? (I’m not sure how, but by adding energy in some way)

Lastly, if we could do this, what would this ‘naked singularity’ look like? Could we find out more about black holes this way?

Since I’m an Indian citizen, it is even more hard to get into these colleges. ( as a matter of fact, astrophysics isn’t offers as an undergraduate course in India and the East Asian countries)

Should I go back for a PhD in Astronomy or continue working as a Software Engineer?,1565168779,"Dear Reddit,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am feeling very conflicted and I don't know who else to ask. My wife is very supportive either way (I am a lucky man), but my indecisiveness is becoming a tad bit annoying.

I am working as a Software Engineer in a large company. After graduating with a MSc in Physics. I have been working as a software engineer for three years. I have now been offered the chance to go back for a PhD researching Extragalactic Physics. The PhD comes with a livable wage (75% of my current salary).

From beginning I was very happy, as being a astronomy professor and researcher has been my dream for a long time. But from reading around on the internet, the career prospects in astronomy seem very slim, which is scaring me. I am pretty happy with my job as a software engineer and it comes with good benefits and a good salary. I am good at my job and I think there are a lot of room for career growth.

I am afraid that I will endeavor on this PhD and afterwards (5 years later) go back to something similar to my old job or worse. Meanwhile this time could have been used for career growth. I keep going back and forth in my mind (I have been looking for PhD positions for two years and in beginning I was really sure that this was something I wanted to do, but now I really don’t know)

Black Hole Fractal Universe Creation Theory,1565046293,"Hello,

I am no astrophysicist, but I have been thinking ALOT recently and trying to reconcile things conceptually, and I wanted to see what everyone thinks about this :

I believe that our universe was a star in a different universe, and for some reason, when a star is more than 10 solar masses and dies, it creates what we have termed here a ""black hole"", but I believe that what is REALLY happening, is that we are just seeing what the portal to the new universe it created looks like.  

So our universe was a star in another universe, it died, created our universe, and now when we look back in time, all of our observation and math breaks down when we get back to the singularity, because before that would have been before our universe excited as a universe at all.  

It is really beautiful to conceptualize it like this, because what you get is an infinite universe, reproducing itself mind boggling amounts of time.  There are billions of trillions of stars that are more than 10 solar masses in this universe.  Those will all create new universes with billions of trillions of stars, and so on and so fourth forever in a fractal pattern.

When we observe physically and mathematically back in time, we observe eventually a point that is infinitely small.  The only other thing that has one of those?  A BLACK HOLE!

Gravity is the most important and fundamental force in the universe because it creates and maintains them.

Time travel to past,1564991090,"Dark energy: whenever some objects feels gravity,it curves the space-time, space-time becomes like a bowl shaped pit below the object.But in the environment of dark energy a object always feel anti-gravity forces,so then there is a bump in space-time underneath the object, if that object has any velocity that must be negative velocity asspace-time curvature at that time is just opposite the case where the object feels the gravity not antigravity, so if it(object in antigravity) has a velocity it must be negative velocity,because situation where object feels antigravity its velocity is negative as situation is opposite of gravity induced situation. If we attain velocity magnitude C(Velocity of light)with positive velocity and continue for one week ,after that will go into the future 100 years ahead of the time from when we started, for example. With negative velocity in similar fashion we can go 100 years back into the past. So if we find a path in universe through dark energy, and if an object proceeds with negative velocity with magnitude C through that path ,that object can reach past in that manner.

Apologies if this is not the sort of thing that typically gets discussed here. If you'll indulge me for a moment:

Jupiter is a big ball of hydrogen. Not big enough to become a star, though. Needs about 13 times (right?) more mass before gravity overcomes the strong force and atoms start fusing, making it a star.

To that end, assuming a race of god-like aliens with the ability to bend reality to their every whim wanted to starrify Jupiter, they'd just need to triskidecuple the mass, right?

Question about reducing tidal effects in super gravity,1564442603,"So I want to study astrophysics in college (currently going into grade 11) and over the summer I have started writing a book (sci-fi) about a world that is orbiting a black hole-Star binary system.

How I thought about it was I had the world tidally locked to the system, so one side was always bright and moving slower and the other was always dark and moving faster. One of the main plot points is that this world is actually a space station deployed by humans to study the physics of black holes and life in hyper gravity. The tidal forces would tear it apart if it was actually a planet, but is there a way that the station could resist this effect (in its core, perhaps)? I did the calculations for a station that is 20-25 million meters away from the center of gravity (it’s very close, but it was the only way to get the right amount of time dilation). Any suggestions?

Qurstion of Dark Matter/Energy
u/AdAstra_42
So I am not a physicist by any means or prefix, however I am a fan, I came up with a theory on Dark Matter and the expansion of space time that i would like feedback on (preferably without insults, but all the same. So here it goes:
Theory: Dark Matter/Energy is actually just the momentum of the expansion of space. Or the reativistic mass (dont lose interest over that term i believe it comes full circle) of a massless photon like particle that lacks electromagnetic radiation but still like a photon has momentum. If this mystery particle was produces similarly like photons via electrons and positrons or vise versa from photon colisions but in more numerous quantaties than photons after anhialation and given the lack of EMR the particle incapable of exciting the matter containing it like photons in a perfectly reflective cube though massless eventually becomes volumous. And if these particles were thier own anti, lacked an anti or were just more numerous as is matter to antimatter the constant prduction and conglomeration of these particles would surely cause the need for expansion if like photons could on a massive scale at least imitate mass by the need for volume i would assume the same. Now i dont know if it would be possible over a cosmic calender for a photon to be stripped of its emr or exactly what the quantum or energy this massless particle is representing but i suppose im asking if it makes sense up to a point. I appreciate any responses. (Unless they include my mother, but ill take it. )

*
i realize that this assumption requires the volume of the universe to be an increasing finite space but it seemed like the idea of the volumous massless particle fit beautifully im the bubble/ balloon universe structure.

Added: i guess along with this thinking i was thinking that even if it was an emr stripped version of a photon that didn't need to avoid impact like some photons do then even if limited to the speed of light the mean speed of the photons as a collective vs the avg spd of my make believe particle collective a minute difference would make a notable collective difference. This is just a thought if the particles speed limit was C.

If this mystery particle was produces similarly like photons via electrons and positrons or vise versa from photon colisions but in more numerous quantaties than photons after anhialation and given the lack of EMR the particle incapable of exciting the matter containing it like photons in a perfectly reflective cube though massless eventually becomes volumous. And if these particles were thier own anti, lacked an anti or were just more numerous as is matter to antimatter the constant prduction and conglomeration of these particles would surely cause the need for expansion if like photons could on a massive scale at least imitate mass by the need for volume i would assume the same. Now i dont know if it would be possible over a cosmic calender for a photon to be stripped of its emr or exactly what the quantum or energy this massless particle is representing but i suppose im asking if it makes sense up to a point. I appreciate any responses. (Unless they include my mother, but ill take it. )",astrophysics,AdAstra_42,/r/astrophysics/comments/cio6py/qurstion_of_dark_matterenergy/,0

I already make decent money as a software developer but I want to go back to my love of physics and get a degree + phd in Astrophysics. I’m looking at 10+ yrs of school.

Question on Expanding Universe,1563479866,"So this is an idea I've had for awhile and I am curious if anybody on here can explain why or why not this may be the case:

The common understanding is that we reside in a universe that is expanding outward (presumably into some void). We know this because we can view material objects moving away from us in all directions. Now, isn't it also possible that the universe is not actually expanding outward into a void, but is completely static in terms of the size of its boundaries? In order for this to be the case, the material objects within the universe would all have to be continuously shrinking. If that were true, an observer on any planet would still view all the other planets/material objects as moving further and further away, when in reality everything is shrinking and therefore creating more space in between each other.

Is there any way to prove that the universe is definitely expanding, and not that the material objects in space are just all shrinking together? I hope I made this question clear enough, interested to hear thoughts!",astrophysics,decimated_napkin,/r/astrophysics/comments/cexe1e/question_on_expanding_universe/,0

How do black holes have such MASSIVE gravity?,1562381233,"I’ve never seemed to understand how black holes manage to create the near infinite gravitational well that they do in space. I know that black holes start as massive stars, ones that create a decently large gravitational well, but not an infinite one.

Once it collapses, gravity pulls the matter into an infinite density, also creating an event horizon in which nothing can escape.

The thing that confuses me about this is that how does the massive star go from creating a large gravitational well to creating an even bigger one with an event horizon if there is no added mass?",astrophysics,Brisby2,/r/astrophysics/comments/c9oma1/how_do_black_holes_have_such_massive_gravity/,8

Determining the age of a cluster using main sequence turn off point,1561991700,"Lifetime of Main Sequence = (10\^10 years)/(M\^3) \[M in solar masses\]

Lifetime of Cluster= Lifetime of Main sequence

M of Main Sequence is determined by plotting a CM diagram (B-V on x, V on y), then finding the BV value at the turn off point and with that finding the mass.

This is the reference I am using to match the BV index with the supposed mass of the star : [http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/\~kolena/hou/stellarproperties.html](http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~kolena/hou/stellarproperties.html) 

1) M must be 1 solar mass or more if we are to obtain any age that is 10 billion years or less.

2) What to do if the turn off point corresponds to a mass that is less than 1 solar mass? Does this method even work in these cases? 

3) I was working on Arp Madore 2, and the B-V of the turn off is 1.05, which corresponds to roughly 0.7 solar masses, which then returns a nonsensically larger age than the expected 5 billion years.   
4) I switched to working on M93, and the turn off is at 0.13, which is 2.1 solar masses, which then returns 1.08 billion years, unlike the literature value of 390 million years.

The 5th Dimension and GravityWaves,1561156119,"At first, i will sound pretty stupid, because i could never reach that niveau of scientific precision in another language than my First Language (German)

Could dark matter be explained as mass sinking in space time?,1561088576,"I know that here I'll be separating space and time as two different concepts, thus most probably will be making lots of fundamental mistakes. Please consider this as a thought experiment and if you play along, it'd make me more than happy :)

Here I go;

We know that movement of an object can only be observed relative to another object and there is no way for an observer to know if itself is moving or stationary, if there are no other reference points available. Therefore, we do not talk about absolute positions within space, since there is no practical way for us measure it. We don't have an anchor.

In a recent paper ([https://www.space.com/sea-serpent-galaxy-dark-matter-markarian-1216.html](https://www.space.com/sea-serpent-galaxy-dark-matter-markarian-1216.html)) a very old galaxy was found to contain more dark matter than scientists anticipated.

Would it be possible to develop a model, where matter is sinking in space time? As if, the galaxies we measure with more dark matter content being actually older and absolutely more stationary so that they had more time to curve that specific portion of space? 

You can imagine space as an elastic fabric, increasing it's elasticity as it kept curved. So matter can bend space, and it keeps bending more and more in time as long as the curvature created is absolutely stationary within that portion of space. Longer the fabric is bent, higher the gravitational force it'd create, slower the time would get and the effect would zero itself at event horizon, since time would stop for the observer of the curvature.

This effect should be exponential in added mass (more mass added into the system would mean even more mass to be added), orthogonal to the time dimension, therefore relativity can be explaining a special case within what actually is happening.

If this is true; 

1. as galaxies are moving faster, they need to look as if  they have ""less dark matter content"", which should be compensated up to some level by relativistic mass gained by increased speed. So, from special relativity perspective, we should be observing less relativistic mass than calculated for galaxies with positive acceleration.
2. we would have more ways to create black holes, such as keeping any mass absolutely stationary in space for a certain amount (very, very long) of time.
3. black holes should have less actual mass than we calculate, since they'd have to had curved space more than their initial mass has caused.
4. dark matter is a concept in order to compensate for the effect.
5. if we know the age of a galactic body and its mass, we can calculate how fast it moves relative to its absolute position in space, but still we could obtain just a scalar result.",astrophysics,ocivelek,/r/astrophysics/comments/c35np6/could_dark_matter_be_explained_as_mass_sinking_in/,9

That said, maybe a disclaimer: this post is about an alternative hypothesis for solar models, in particular that the Sun is an electrically discharging body. It's not the currently accepted hypothesis, I'm not arguing that it should be, and I'm not arguing that it's a rigorously tested hypothesis that can answer all of the outstanding issues regarding solar physics. I'm not here to promote this hypothesis as the ""correct"" one, and I'm not here to debate why the standard model of solar physics is ""wrong."" 

What I do really want to talk about tho is the [SAFIRE experiment](https://www.safireproject.com/), because I think it's extremely interesting and I want to know if people in this sub have heard about/if they have any thoughts about it/are willing to entertain the model as an alternative hypothesis worth exploring further, even if there are unresolved issues with it.

The Phase I model of the experiment was a bell-jar vacuum chamber with a small metal spherical anode and a copper cathode, 1800W DC power, coupled with high-speed cameras, oscilloscopes, and optical/mass spectrometers. Using this setup, they were able to demonstrate a stable, self-organizing plasma in the chamber. The phenomena also included moving tufts that increased in number relative to the current, concentric rings of double-layers that showed independent rotation, and bursts of high-energy within the 2M to 10MW range.

The Phase II setup was a steel, cylindrical vacuum chamber 4' in diameter and 7' long, powered by 200kW of DC current, with a mounted Langmiur probe and optical/mass spectrometers that can move around the entire chamber on gimbals. There are also antennas inside the chamber for measuring radio/EM signals coming from inside, and high-space/infrared/UV cameras.

They've got [one presentation from their results with Phase I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFsTttzh0oA) back from '15, and three presentations demonstrating the results of Phase II so far, [one from 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K_GBBspZjs),[one from 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keJAQIWEyzY), and [one from 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IAiMpmGx-M) and I'd recommend folks at least watching them.

Double slit experiment,1557448242,"Hi PHYSICISTS, 

My knowledge in quantum mechanics  is very much basic but my interest in learning it is increasing exponentially. Kindly accept my apologies if either I fail to explain or I'm so fundamental. 

 So I stumbled upon a topic where a 2D creature  cannot imagine/understand a 3D object(at least not easily) and as far as humans considered it is harder to imagine a 4D object. One explanation from Dr.Neil deGrasse Tyson about passing a 3D object, a sphere, through a 2D creature for example an ant detailed that it would appear to that ant as a Dot or 1D object at first then a circle (2D) grows upto the diameter and then starts to shrink and disappear. It makes a perfect sense. 

Now, light has duality. It's a particle as well as a wave right? In double slit experiment, the single individual photons when passed through a double slit follows a pattern of wave. It is still an unresolved question(afaik) why the light when allowed to pass through two slits appear in a random fashion at first but  finally forms a wave form. Now what I wonder is why can't light be some form a 4D particle which we cannot imagine without seeing it as one(considering that we cannot imagine a 4D easily) . Is there any research conducted why can't light be like some form a sphere to that ant to a human? 

I hope you understand my question. If not feel free to ask me explain more. TIA",astrophysics,scienceguynotreally,/r/astrophysics/comments/bmrl3h/double_slit_experiment/,97

A black hole universe,1556709275,"Hi all

&amp;#x200B;

Probably a silly question, but I was thinking about this last night and can't get it out of my head. Hopefully someone can explain this to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine you have a universe that is big and has some (non-trivial) average density of matter. From a point at the edge of this universe, the gravitational effect could be calculated based on an assumption that all of the matter was located at a single point (i.e. the centre of mass of the universe) \[correct me if I am wrong on this\].

So I was thinking that if you made the universe bigger, but kept the average density of matter the same, the amount of matter (proportional to volume) would go up by the cube of the increase in radius, but the amount of gravity at the edge of the universe would increase as you only need to devide by r squared.

Firstly, is the above correct, or am I making a mistake somewhere?

If the above is correct, then it would imply that if you grow the universe (but keep the average density the same, i.e. add uniform shells of matter at the outer edge), then at some point the edge of the universe will have enough gravity to effectively make it an event horizon. So the universe will become a black hole.

The problem I have with this is that shell theorem would say that each shell added should have no gravitational effect on the objects inside it. So to anything inside the universe there is no impact of the universe changing into a black hole. That seems really weird. It also seems to imply that for a given density, there is a maximum allowable size for a universe; is this right.

Again apologies if this is just me missing some really basic stuff, but would appreciate pointers to how to better understand this sort of stuff.",astrophysics,wonderingwho82,/r/astrophysics/comments/bjfvrh/a_black_hole_universe/,0

Is Cosmological Redshift Caused By Plasma Redshift?,1555435521," Center-to-limb solar redshift has been observed for more than a century.   This unusual redshift observation demonstrates that ""plasma redshift"" is a real cause of photon redshift, and it is an observed process that is taking place in plasma which is located inside of our own solar system.

&amp;#x200B;

[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005APS..APR.D1003G](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005APS..APR.D1003G)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After the red/blue-shift due to our Sun's rotation is subtracted from the data, there remains a puzzling center-to- limb redshift which incereases by a 3:1 ratio at the limb. This variation contrasts to the expected gravitational redshift that should be independent of center-to-limb position. The observed functional variation is consistent with a photon energy-loss mechanism in the Sun's \`\`plasma atmosphere.'' Several different energy-loss redshift mechanisms have been proposed including Compton, Plasma, pseudo-Raman, etc redshifts. Where possible, these proposals are quantitatively examined and critiqued. If the Sun's expected theoretical Gravitational redshift is subtracted form the data, there remains a puzzling Blueshift at the center which gradually transforms to a Redshift at the limb. The possible origins(s) of this complex behavior will be discussed including the Solar wind, convection Doppler-shifts, and the Wolf redshift mechanism. This important Solar center-to- limb redshift data can serve as a testing ground for some energy-loss (non-Doppler/Expansion) redshift mechanisms since the electron density vs altitude is known.

&amp;#x200B;

Various plasma redshift explanations for this phenomenon have been around for several decades.

&amp;#x200B;

[http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/chromosphere/](http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/chromosphere/)

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, we even have laboratory confirmation of plasma redshift, including empirical evidence that the number of free electrons inside of the plasma is directly related to the amount of plasma redshift observed:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402608000089](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402608000089)

[https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2007.12.004](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2007.12.004)

&amp;#x200B;

In recent years we've also discovered that our own galaxy, and presumable every galaxy is surrounded by hot plasma.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://scitechdaily.com/chandra-shows-halo-of-hot-gas-surrounding-the-milky-way/](https://scitechdaily.com/chandra-shows-halo-of-hot-gas-surrounding-the-milky-way/)

&amp;#x200B;

We've also learned over the decades that space is full of dust and plasma.   Why then would we not presume that  plasma redshift is the real cause of cosmological redshift?

&amp;#x200B;

A plasma redshift explanation for the redshift/distant phenomenon noticed by Hubble does not require any violation of conservation of energy laws, and it enjoys observational support within our own solar system, and laboratory support as well.

Is it possible to be inside two event horizons at the same time and how does that work?,1554971612,"A more detailed version of the question is: within a hypothetical binary system of two black holes, could the event horizons intersect each other? For exapmle, prior to the merger detected by LIGO in 2015, objects were seperated by a mere 350km of space in between. Since masses of these black holes were different, an object spiraling into the event horizon of the smaller one may have an orbit that leads to the other, more massive black holes event horizon, and thus; might leave the orbit of the first one and join the other, right? Would this actually count as an escape from an event horizon?

The speed of light will still measure to be 300,000,000 meters per second for you despite the fact that you are traveling 150,000,000 m/s?  The speed of light is ALWAYS a constant 300,000,000 m/s to everything regardless of how fast you may be traveling?

Galaxy rotation patterns are better explained by Birkeland currents than by dark matter.,1554253456," 📷[r/space](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/)•Posted by[u/MichaelMozina](https://www.reddit.com/user/MichaelMozina)[31 minutes ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/b8r5rk/galaxy_rotation_patterns_are_better_explained_by/)

## Galaxy rotation patterns are better explained by Birkeland currents than by dark matter.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1397](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1397)

[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028174-900-universes-highest-electric-current-found/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028174-900-universes-highest-electric-current-found/)

We  already have strong observational evidence that powerful electric  currents traverse almost unimaginable distances of spactime.  We also  have mathematical models that describe the physical formations observed  in  currents in plasma, specifically field aligned ""Birkeland currents"":

[http://www.ptep-online.com/2015/PP-41-13.PDF](http://www.ptep-online.com/2015/PP-41-13.PDF)

[http://www.ptep-online.com/2018/PP-53-01.PDF](http://www.ptep-online.com/2018/PP-53-01.PDF)

One  of the most important and unique predictions of a Birkeland current  galaxy rotation model is the prediction that electrical currents move  plasma in different directions at different radii from the center of the  galaxy.  Some plasma current can be moving in one direction  (clockwise), and other currents (further from the radii) moving in the  opposite direction (counter clockwise), and it's fully capable of easily  transporting a bi-directional flow of current.

What  we should ""predict"" that we should find in a Birkeland current driven  galaxy rotation model are instances of counter rotational movements in  at least some galaxies.   Likewise we would expect that at least some  few galaxies wouldn't necessarily have much current flowing through each  and every galaxy, in which case gravity alone should suffice to explain  the rotation patterns of galaxies without strong external currents  present.  In both instance, both predictions have been observed.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1263](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1263)

We  certainly do observe galaxies that display counter rotational elements  in them as predicted by Birkeland currents.  We also observe at least  some galaxies which seem to be well explained by gravity alone.

[http://keckobservatory.org/df2-df4/](http://keckobservatory.org/df2-df4/)

Considering  the far greater range of ""predictions"" made by a Birkeland current  driven galaxy rotation model, compared to a dark matter model, the  Birkeland current rotation model seems far more robust.  It not only  explains why some galaxies rotate faster in some instances, it also  explains the existence of counter rotation rings in some galaxies as  well.",astrophysics,MichaelMozina,/r/astrophysics/comments/b8rjvn/galaxy_rotation_patterns_are_better_explained_by/,18
The true CAUSE of gravity and an explanation for what dark matter is and how it is created in four simple paragraphs....,1554253138," 

Dark matter is a property of space-time which is actually the universal EM field that light, radiation, and the EM force can potentially travel through. This universal field is massless and ELASTIC. All points in that field wish to remain where they are and do not move unless something with mass forces it to move, by that mass displacing those points in space-time and occupying that location itself. Because matter or things with mass DISPLACE and curve that universal EM field into a halo surrounding it, and gravity is the force of that field pushing against that mass to return to the location it has been displaced from. 

Just like a rubber band, the further the distance a point in space-time has been displaced or stretched from its starting point, the more resistance the space-time will be pushing back with. So as soon as that mass gets out of its way, stress will be relieved on that point in the field as it will be allowed to return to its natural position. The part of the field that has been displaced around the mass that has displaced it I call a ""gravity halo"". So if a smaller mass gets inside of the gravity halo of a larger mass, that smaller mass will be PUSHED towards the larger mass because that portion of the universal EM field (space-time) will be pushing to try to return to the center of that larger mass (the location it was displaced from) and that smaller mass just happens to now be in its way. 

So things like matter WITH MASS displace and curve that universal EM field into a halo surrounding it, but MASSLESS things like light, radiation, and the EM force pass THROUGH that field WITHOUT displacing or disturbing that MASSLESS field. So those massless things travel THROUGH the field, and things with mass travel IN BETWEEN that field. No dark matter particle will ever be found, because dark matter is not something that follows physical matter around as it travels across space-time, because that dark matter is PART of the space-time. 

So that means that as a massive body is traveling across space-time it is temporarily transforming the portions it displaces into that halo into this dark matter state by forcing it into MOTION, and interaction with the Higgs Field. But as soon as that massive body moves to a different location within that universal field, the portion of the field it just left is allowed to return to its natural position and natural massless state. So that means that displaced portion of the field is able to have effects of mass but only on the rest of the massless field, allowing it to further displace the rest of the field as if it was a mass itself.",astrophysics,TheJeremyHammons,/r/astrophysics/comments/b8rhvn/the_true_cause_of_gravity_and_an_explanation_for/,16

What would happen in the scenario of a moon fall?,1552311165,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vb483rbgshl21.png

For a science project we have to imagine what would happen if our solar system had something different OR something would happen that could make things different. My idea was about depicting the falling of the moon (a plausible % of it) caused by a vagrant asteroid, and how it could affect our geography.

Of course there's too many factors to take in consideration, and i'm having contradictory results on what would happen.

So i came here to depict my scenario, and hope you can help me answer some questions.

1. An asteroid hits the moon hard enough to cause a part of it to crumble and fall on the earth
2. Earth gets hit by a (lunar debris? Meteor?) shower, great enough to cause damages on a global scale, but not enough to shutdown life or cause a worst-case apocalictic scenario
3. Sea levels will rise enough to change geography, and we would have a subsequent global warming, and after a couple years an ice age
4. Earth axis and orbit would change enough to keep sustaining life but not enough to destroy the world as we know it
5. In the meantime an asteroid cloud, and then a ring would form around earth and moon from all debris

Lunar mass, should be [7,342e+22 kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon). I started thinking that i wanted a best case scenario:The moon falls. Temperature rise and subsequently falls, enough to not cause a mass extinction and preserve a parvence of civilization. In 200 years everything is back to ""normal"". Anyway comunication based on satellites is down. How much of that moon would have to fall to make this possible?

"Was the existence of an aether, or universal medium for light, truly disproven by Special Relativity or the Michelson-Morley results?",1551998866," 

Many people seem to think that the Michelson-Morley experiments and Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity in 1905 disproved the existence of an aether that light travels through. Let's see what Einstein said about the idea of an aether in 1920, nearly five years after releasing his General Theory of Relativity...

""Recapitulating, we may say that according to the General Theory of Relativity space is endowed with physical qualities. In this sense there exists an aether. Space without an aether is unthinkable. Not only would there be no propagation of light, but also no standards of space and time. Newtonian action at a distance is only apparent. In truth is conveyed by a medium  
permeating space.""

\--- Albert Einstein (Leiden address, 1920)

So contrary to popular belief, even Einstein ultimately concluded that there MUST be an aether or medium that light travels through.

The only reason that people thought that the Michelson-Morley experiments disproved an aether is because they had misguided expectations about what the nature of the aether should be. So, in reality they only proved that a certain kind of aether did not exist. They were expecting to find things like aether winds caused by the Earth rotating or traveling across the aether.

What nobody at that time considered was the possibility that the aether itself is the cause of gravity, and that the aether would ALWAYS be pushing against the Earth from all directions no matter how much it rotated or traveled across the aether. So, the only effects that should be expected to be found from the aether is the gravity effects that it is causing.",astrophysics,TheJeremyHammons,/r/astrophysics/comments/ayitym/was_the_existence_of_an_aether_or_universal/,45

However, I understand that due to the infinite time dilation as things enter a black hole to observers objects seem to be stationary, which is why black holes seem to be very close to absolute 0, and only the Hawking radiation can be measured.

I am writing an observing proposal abstract for a class. Any advice?,1551850393,"Post-Gravitational Waves: Aftermath and Effects on Light Waves
Tommy Gray

	On August 17, 2017, the advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo gravitational wave detectors observed the first documented gravitational waves from a binary neutron star system inspiral, aptly named GW170817. The waves were recorded for nearly one hundred seconds. Following this burst of gravitational waves, subsequent light waves of varying frequencies were observed coming from the same location. Further exploration of this source, in every frequency of light, is necessary, however, to see the full effects and relationship between bursts of gravitational waves and waves of light that emit from the source. This proposal, specifically, aims to use the VLBA directed towards the source object, GW170817, in order to observe the radio waves being emitted post-inspiral. This project will result in interesting data on the relationship between inspirals of binary neutron star systems, the resulting gravitational waves, and the radio waves emitted post-inspiral by looking at the way the radio wave frequency has changed throughout the months following the inspiral. This data could further corroborate previous data that claims this merger to be that of a binary neutron star system, and provide insight into the relationship between electromagnetic and gravitational waves.

What if Einstein was right for the wrong reasons?,1551756491," 

I can't believe that nobody ever points out the very obvious and fundamental problems that exist with the concept of ""space-time"" being curved in the way Einstein describes. I mean look at the illustrations of it. What you see is a spherical planet hovering above a spherical impression in the space-time that is much larger than the volume of the planet itself. But, we are never given any explanation for why a mass should be able to displace space-time beyond the limits of its own volume. 

Newton was wrong when he proposed that gravity was an attractive force where one mass mysteriously pulled on another, and Einstein was closer but still wrong with this concept that gravity is NOT a force, but simply a case where space-time is curved into a well or valley surrounding the larger mass and that smaller masses near it are just following the curvature of space-time. Not to mention the fact that Einstein never explained why a mass should be able to PULL a massless field towards itself in the first place. How do you grab a massless field to pull it anywhere? 

It is actually the inverse of what Einstein is proposing or what these graphics of space-time seem to illustrate. It is the volume and density of that mass that determines how much of the field it is displacing around it, because whatever location that mass is occupying, it has displaced the field from occupying that location. So, it displaces the field into a spherical halo that completely surrounds it that would nicely fill the cavity that seems to exist between the planet and the field in the illustrations. The field is ELASTIC, and all points in that field wish to remain where they are. Those points only move from their natural location when they are forced to move by a mass occupying that location itself. So, the field would be fighting to return to the location that mass removed it from by occupying that location itself, and it returns to its natural location the moment that mass gets out of its way.  

So, that displaced part of the field has a preferred direction in that gravity halo surrounding that mass, where the field is pushing towards the center of that mass, the location that field is trying to return to. Another way of saying it would be that the field in its natural state in regions separated from any massive bodies would be like a scalar or tensor field, but the displaced part of the field surrounding a mass would be like a vector field, because it has a preferred direction that it is trying to travel towards. So the displaced part of the field is flowing like a river in ONE direction towards the mass that displaced it. So it would require extra force, energy, or effort to paddle upstream than to paddle downstream. Because that displaced part of the field is ACCELERATING you in one direction, and RESISTING you in the other, just like a river. 

But, you must keep in mind that this is only true for the smaller mass inside of the ""gravity halo"" of a larger mass it is near. There are no such effects being encountered by the larger mass causing that halo or displacement of the field. Because the field is pushing against the larger mass from ALL directions instead of just ONE like the smaller mass. So if the larger mass is being pushed against from the direction it is trying to travel, it means it is also being pushed forward an equal amount from behind, canceling those forces out. Because as the larger mass travels across the field introducing stress to the new location, it is relieving stress from the field in equal measure from the location it just left.

That gravity halo surrounding the mass where the field is densely compressed due to displacement is what is known as dark matter, and is the cause of all gravity. Because the mass itself can only directly displace an amount of the field less than or equal to its volume it is occupying (depending on its density). But, the part of the field directly displaced by the mass itself then acquires the traits of dark matter or dark mass and begins displacing the rest of the field itself. So the further displacement caused by the field itself would dissipate the further away you get from that mass and the ""dark matter"" surrounding it. 

So this ""dark matter"" or displaced portions of the field are the direct cause of all gravity, not the mass itself that field is surrounding. Regular matter travels across the field and displaces it, but dark matter is PART of the field itself. So dark matter is not traveling across space following the mass it is surrounding. That mass is constantly transforming different parts of the field in its path into this dark matter state, and the location in the field that mass just left returns to its natural state.

There is no force described or explained by General Relativity, there is only the explanation that the smaller mass is following the curvature of space-time caused by the larger mass it is near. Well, what happens when one mass is NOT larger than the other? I propose that it is something like this... If two masses of exactly equal volume and density were traveling parallel to each other at exactly the same speed. where each MASS was entirely INSIDE of the gravity halo of the other, (not just the halos themselves overlapping) they would not ""pull"" each other closer to one another or disturb the inertia of the other. Because if mass A is able to displace the field from the location it is occupying, it is also able to RESIST the field trying to push it towards mass B that has displaced the field in an equal amount. Those forces would essentially cancel each other out and would be as if the other mass was not there. 

The gravity FORCE can only be effective when one mass is greater than the other. Even when one mass IS greater than the other, it requires the smaller mass itself to be inside of the gravity halo of the larger mass. The halo of the smaller mass overlapping the halo of the larger mass is NOT enough. Because the smaller mass ITSELF must be PUSHED towards the larger mass by the field, NOT PULLED when the gravity halo of the larger mass pulls on the gravity halo of the smaller mass. Because mass, gravity, or anything else CANNOT PULL a massless field anywhere, it can only displace it by occupying that location itself. 

If you want to believe in the standing theory of General Relativity, it means you must believe that gravity is NOT a force caused by a mass mysteriously pulling on other masses as Newton described, and must actually believe that gravity is NOT a force at all. But, is instead simply a case of the smaller mass following the curvature of space-time that has been caused by the bigger mass it is near. But, where the concept gets inconsistent is in the formation of black holes, where gravity magically becomes a force again when the gravity of the star magically has an effect on ITSELF. Causing it to pull itself inward and collapse to a so called ""singularity"" that can only exist on paper or in the minds of men, but never in reality. If you believe that illogical nonsense, then please demonstrate by pulling YOURSELF somewhere. A cart does not pull itself anywhere, it requires a force or a horse existing outside of the cart to pull it anywhere.

Newton proposed an attractive FORCE, where a mass was mysteriously pulling on other masses, the only thing that Einstein really changed with General Relativity is the concept of what is being pulled on. Because Einstein is basically proposing that a mass is now mysteriously pulling on space-time instead, without ever explaining how or why that mass should be able to pull a massless field anywhere. My explanation is this... Gravity IS an actual FORCE being imposed onto the smaller mass, but it is NOT an attractive force where it is ""pulling"" on ANYTHING. It can only PUSH things that are in its way. So the old phrase that, ""Spacetime tells matter how to move, and matter tells spacetime how to curve."", would still be true in a way but not for the reasons that Einstein thought.

Keep in mind that density plays a major role in my theory as well. Because the displacement of the field must be less than or equal to the volume of the mass displacing it, depending on the DENSITY of that mass. Even if you adopted my theory as the CAUSE of gravity, GR would still be a useful tool for measuring, describing, predicting, and visualizing the EFFECTS of gravity because the amount of gravity force is still ultimately determined by the volume and density of the mass displacing the field. GR accurately describes the EFFECTS of gravity, I just believe it fails to understand its CAUSE. Gravity is not an attractive force where it is a mass is PULLING on other masses like Newton described or a mass PULLING on space-time like Einstein described. 

It is a case of a smaller mass being PUSHED by the field toward the larger mass that displaced that part of the field, because that smaller mass is in between the displaced part of the field of the larger mass and the center of the larger mass, which is the location the field is trying to return to. So just because the amount of gravity force is determined by the volume and density of the mass doesn't mean that gravity is a property of that mass. It is a property of the FIELD and the counter force of the field trying to return to the location it has been displaced from. 

I made this post to start an interesting conversation and to lead the reader to start asking the right questions about GR. The questions you should be asking yourself about GR is why do we ASSUME that it is even possible for a mass to directly displace space-time beyond the limits of its own volume? AND... Why do we ASSUME that a massless field is something that can be PULLED on in the first place? How does one grab a massless field to PULL on it? No answer is ever given as to what mechanism allows or causes the mass to warp the field in an a large area surrounding that mass that goes beyond the volume and reach of that mass itself as is described but not explained in GR. GR is based on these ASSUMPTIONS being true, so what is the explanation for why we should make these assumptions?

Some people object to referring to the effect on the space-time surrounding a mass as the space-time being pulled. It doesn't matter what words you use to describe the effect on space-time, so it matters not it you call it pulling, curving, warping, or distorting. The only thing important is that you are proposing an EFFECT on the field we call space-time that is surrounding that mass. The problem is, in GR nobody ever explained why the space-time or field surrounding the mass should be warped around it in the first place, or what CAUSED it to be that way.

If the gravity force simply describes the acceleration caused when the smaller mass is following the curvature of a larger mass it is near, then what is the force that describes what created the curvature that surrounds that larger mass in the first place? You can't have it both ways. If you are going to describe the gravity force as the acceleration caused by following the curvature of space-time, then you need a SECOND and DIFFERENT force to describe what created the curvature in the first place. 

When you get into a bathtub your body is only able to displace an amount of water that is equal to your body's own volume. It is not able to displace water equal to its own volume plus a large area surrounding it as the concept of GR asks you to believe is happening to space-time. So, what is this mysterious force that is going beyond the reach of the mass itself to warp the space-time in a large area around it?

General Relativity just asks you to make the assumption that the space-time IS warped in a large area surrounding it in they way they describe, and tells you to just go forward on the basis that assumption is true. But, they never explain why we should be making that assumption in the first place.

Just because you have found a way to properly measure, predict, and visualize the EFFECTS of gravity does not mean you have properly explained the CAUSE. I feel that my post has explained the reasons why my concept can explain everything that GR can explain and MORE, and does so without asking you to make any ASSUMPTIONS as GR does. Because my concept ALSO explains what dark matter actually is and how it is created.

Whether you choose Einstien's concept or mine, in either case you must assume that a star collapsing to a black hole is caused by something other than a mysterious force that causes a mass to pull on ITSELF. Because this idea is inconsistent with how gravity is supposed to work in all other applications in GR AND my interpretation. When you are calculating the effect of gravity or the weight of something, you need a mass A and a mass B, not just a mass A. Because the gravity CAUSED by mass A should not have an EFFECT on mass A itself. 

Some have tried to object to my notion that one mass must be at least slightly greater than another for there to be a gravity effect. To those people I would ask, do you fall towards the Earth or does the Earth fall towards you? What do you think determines which one falls towards which? It would be determined by which mass is BIGGER or MORE MASSIVE. Even according to GR what I said about two masses of EXACTLY the same volume and density should be true. Because if Mass A and Mass B are identical then they are warping or curving the field in identical ways. 

One of those masses would need to be slightly larger than the other creating a ""deeper"" impression on the space-time for that other mass to follow that curvature ""downwards"" towards that larger mass. If they are identical masses displacing the field identically then it would be like they are on flat ground relative to each other. Mass A would not create a deeper ""well"" or ""valley"" than Mass B is already creating for itself, or vice versa. So neither of them would have a deeper valley or deeper curvature being created near them to follow or fall towards, because they would both be on level ground to each other.

Gravity and weight is something that should only exist between TWO masses, between a larger one and a smaller one. It is NOT something that should exist between a single mass and the ""space-time"" surrounding it. A mass does not put weight onto space-time unless you want to suppose that space-time has its own gravity. Those little experiments that science teachers like to do with a bowling ball and an elastic sheet only serves to confuse the students instead of making them understand what would actually be happening. That is because the experiment is done on Earth a place that is having gravity imposed onto it. So that means the elastic sheet is experiencing WEIGHT from the bowling ball, something that would not be the case for a space-time fabric that does not have its own gravity.  

So if you only put ONE bowling ball on the sheet you can kind of get an idea of how the space-time is being curved or warped in an area surrounding that mass if you keep in mind that its not because the space-time is encountering weight from that mass. But the moment you put a second bowling ball of equal mass on the elastic sheet, it becomes COMPLETELY misrepresentative of how space-time would react in the presence of two identical masses. Because if you had two identical bowling balls next to each other in the center of the elastic sheet it would cause a DEEPER impression in the sheet than if there was only ONE bowling ball on the sheet. 

That would not be the case for space-time, because space-time would not be experiencing WEIGHT as the elastic sheet on Earth is experiencing. So if two identical masses were right next to each other in space-time, they would not collectively put more ""weight"" or a deeper impression onto space-time than if only one of those identical masses was there. And one mass would not create a deeper impression into space-time for the other mass to fall towards, because that other mass would already be making an equally deep impression itself.

The last aspect I will touch on will be about the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing is illustrated in one of the graphics I clipped for this post. It is where the light seems to be curved around a massive body allowing an observer to see a star on the other side that should be blocked from their view by that massive body.  This is NOT caused by gravity. It is caused by DISPLACEMENT.  Gravity is a property of the FIELD, so it can only have an EFFECT on things with mass OUTSIDE of that field. It cannot have an effect on the field itself or the MASSLESS things like light that are traveling THROUGH that field. 

Objects with mass displace the field into a halo surrounding it as it travels across space. Massless things like light do NOT displace the field, because they are traveling THROUGH the field itself. So the gravity of that massive body I mentioned is not pulling the massless light towards itself. The light itself is not being curved, it is the FIELD that the light must travel through that is being curved and warped into a halo surrounding that massive body due to DISPLACEMENT and NOT GRAVITY.  So gravitational lensing should be called DISPLACEMENT lensing. 

If you chose to adopt my theory nothing would change in the way we already measure and predict the EFFECTS of gravity. So believing in my theory doesn't mean you have to throw General Relativity away or something. All my theory does is give an EXPLANATION for the CAUSE of gravity as well as an EXPLANATION for what dark matter is and how it is created. So you can think of this as an addition or adjustment to GR in a way instead of a replacement for it.  So, rather than saying that Einstein was wrong, you could say that he was right for the wrong reasons. 

Anyway, now that you have read this post, please give your thoughts on these two different concepts or interpretations. And please keep in mind that I am not asking if you feel I have been able to prove with this post that my concept is actually true, I am just searching for feedback to see if anyone can find a problem that would not allow this concept to be possible in principle.

Civilization learns the sun is going to turn into a red giant, so they flee the solar system.

The luminosity, the pixel arrays, the pixel probability, the layer statistics—they all are the same as they were before.

They send a probe to the sun. It reaches it 3 months later and sends data back. The data confirms that the sun is the same as it was 400 years ago (back when they decided to flee).

Civilians assume the world government lied to them. An uprising occurs. But after the government leaders are killed, a helium flash occurs in the sun (the data from the probe was wrong—the sun did turn into a red giant).

Since the heat source of the solar corona still seems to still be an enigma, it's worth noting that Kristian Birkeland's cathode solar model offers not only a 'theoretical' explanation for a hot, sustained, full sphere solar corona, it's capable of reproducing one in the lab as well as planetary aurora.  His model  is also entirely consistent with the fact that 99+ percent of all cosmic rays are positively charged particles, mostly hydrogen and helium ions.  Birkeland correctly predicted that space was relatively positively charged.  In fact he made a whole host of successful predictions about the sun over a century ago based on his laboratory experiments which have since been confirmed by satellites in space, including electron beams coming from the sun, both types of charged particles in high speed solar wind, polar jets and coronal loops.

Would matter become more dense if it had to travel through space time folded on itself?

If the universe is expanding, does it bring you to a newer part of the universe?

If time is relative to gravity then time is relative to negative mass and density because without it; there would be no universe, no planets, and no stars for galaxies to exist. If density is related to gravity in space then that means that density also has a relation to time and gravity. 

Therefore, have a just proved a theory about our universe and black holes?

Losing The Nobel Prize with Physicist Brian Keating Episode #52,1549588727,"""Losing The Nobel Prize""

Today we sat down with Professor and Physicist from the University of California San Diego Brian Keating. Brian designed a refracting telescope (BICEP) that was used in an experiment to detect gravitational waves. His team had to retract their findings and ultimately lose the Nobel Prize. His book ""Losing the Nobel Prize"" details how it all went down. We will also discuss The Big Bang, CMB, and the Multiverse. #Physics #BrianKeating #NobelPrize #LosingTheNobelPrize

From what I understand is that an object with mass, lets say a space ship approaches the speed of light, time relative to that object *almost* comes to a stand still. Traveling at 99.99999% the speed of light for a week would be an extraordinary compression of time. 

But what about photons?

They go 100% the speed of light :D

Does time time appear to stop for the perspective of a photon? Obviously when I go out side I can feel the suns warmth so the photons have to have traveled from the sun, thus experiencing time.

As far as base knowledge, I'd say I know a lot. I'm not trying to sound smart. I know that my knowledge only scratches the depths of the field. But I know the basics of things like orbits, how black holes and galaxies and stars form, etc. But what's important is that I'm trying to decide if astrophysics a field worth going into. Actually going to college for such a thing is expensive, time consuming, and difficult. So I don't want to even consider going into it unless I can do a bit of it.  
  

So I'd like to get deeper into the subject. I'd like to learn how to read charts, and do equations, and similar things. I'm totally aware that just because I manage to do some of those things successfully doesn't mean I'm cut out for it. But I'd at least like to learn some college level stuff to see if I can grasp it the concepts and work with them.

Universe Expanding?,1548946988,"Explain it like I'm 5.   


I don't know anything about astrophysics, but a question came to me today about the expanding universe. How do we know, or what reason do we have to believe, that the universe is expanding? In what direction and away from what focal point? Can we point to a position in the sky and say ""there, that's where all the stuff is moving away from""? Or do we just see all things moving in one direction ""away"" from some indeterminate ""X"" position?   


But my real question is how could we deduce that that is, in fact, a focal point or ""wave-in-one-direction"" if all we have is the observable universe? Couldn't we just as easily say that the observable universe is expanding as one among, perhaps, millions of other either centrifugal ""bubbles"" or waves (or whatever) within the larger universe?

Could it really be this easy?!,1548797949,"The center of our galaxy is younger than the outer edge because it ages slower due to increased mass in a volume. More mass is located centrally, so more time dilation. Finally, this dilation works funny... We see a motion of the galaxy, but we cannot see the overall aging of its parts, so we are seeing this motion play out and impose our time on durations. Cool beans. General relativity says this works and we can make some predictions, and so i make this statement:
Dark matter and dark energy is bunk. The only force acting on galaxies to make all its stars move oddly is time; the center of galaxies are experiencing time slower than its edges and to correct this, distance traveled in any given observer second must increase accordingly based on observed galactic core gravity. So long as adjusted velocities do not exceed the speed of light or exceed the potential of the galaxy as a whole, the adjusted view of the thing will swell tremendously in visible volume, the stars interiorly located change more than exteriorly located stars in both x,y,z dimension AND travel many times more meters in a second than we see. This new system will be far larger than we can physically observe, its interior stars will be moving considerably faster than exterior stars and last these will provide the missing energy and mass of the universe in the form of momentum at very high speeds.  The universe is not expanding at an accelerated rate, we are aging slower inside our galaxy than we would outside it; the universe outside our galaxy is being perceived as a whole to be aging many times faster than we are. We are shrinking and so our contracted view increases distances between all objects viewed and steadily magnifies velocities the further away they are from us. The mechanical nature of gravity is the slowing of time at a ratio of mass/density. And we here on earth operate under the umbrella of time sag. A star is creating with its mass/density.

Galactic rotation,1548610591,"Our sun takes approximately 240 million years to orbit the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years old. That means that if the Milky Way were around right at the big bang, which it obviously wasn't, the sun would have only made 57.5 orbits. So how is it possible for a large system like a galaxy to flatten out and form arms when much of it has spun around less than fifty times? I understand that the center of it spins much faster of course but it seems there must have been more time considering that there are also intergalactic relationships as well.

Dreams: Our Subconscious or Unstructured Reality?,1547533120,"Posting this on astrophysics because r/dreams is packed.

On average, 8 out of our 24 hours of a day on Earth are spent asleep and possibly in the dream state. What if instead of that being the dream state, it is unstructured reality and we were able to utilize that time to connect those hours of sleep and subsequent dreams to our current reality? 

Lucid dreaming is a way where trained individuals are able to access and become aware in the dream state. If we were all able to do that, then we would allow are bodies to rest and while our minds continue to work.

I have experienced lucid dreaming once or twice, but my real intrigue lies in the following: 

I once worked on a calculus problem for over 14 hours and when I went to sleep, I was able to solve that problem in my dreams (subconsciously, not by lucid dreaming) and woke up with the solution. So this means my mind continued to work on the problem after I fell asleep. 

If we were able to harness that sort of ability or energy, the possibilities of the amount we could accomplish is endless. However, you would need a different charge code for that. 

What are some of your thoughts?

What if those 8 hours could be utilized to work and seamlessly integrate into the remaining 16 hour days to give us a full 24 hours of reality. 

What if our body gets the necessary rest but our mind continously works like in a lucid dream?
And what if the reason we can't is because the Universe's energy is imbalanced and so, us people or humans, are unable to harness those 8 hours of sleep to properly integrate with our conscious reality? 

I know there are those that can lucid dream through training there mind but what if we could also lucid dream and make it connect our subconscious reality to our conscious reality?
The possibilities are endless.

Just a thought.

"What barriers are outside the big bounce theory? And if the universe is expanding, what is it expanding in?",1546235818,"After watching this awesome video
https://youtu.be/4_aOIA-vyBo

I had some trouble with some things. When the universe expands, doesn't it have to expand within something? Like, when you drop droplets of water in a tub. The droplets of water is the universe, and the more water we add, the more it expands. But, what is the tub? What engulfs the universe? What are we expanding in? 

Also, the big bounce theory, basically same question, if the universe is always expanding, and we do compress once again as the theory states, doesn't that mean that the big crunchs location is different then the big bangs? That means these two are moving within a medium. There is something they are both sitting on, right? What is it?

Perception and physical sense of up and down in space while rotating on an object,1545505298,"Hi everybod!

Im from mobile, i dont see megathreads, so sorry if there is one for simple questions like this. I got into an argument with somebody and i would like you to settle this, since my partner will deem any disagreement from my side as an act of my supposed inability of accepting defeat. As im not a physicist my word has no weight for him. The question goes like this:

If there is a big circular structure that spins in space in one axis and you are attached to that structure by magnets, would you “feel” that you are upside down to your previous position, if you spin 180 degree? Also, does it matter if you are attached to the outside of a sphere or the inside of a ring? (Its basically the scene from the Travelers where they go out of the ship.) 

My debate partner said that its too small of an object (in the movie) not to feel upside down and that you would feel it. I said that you would know that you might be upside down to your previous position but you couldnt sense it at all, it would be like everything else is spinning.  

Could you settle it? Basically you can tell me everything about spinning in space and how one would perceive it. For example if i would start rotating in space would i still feel sick and vomit?

I'm doing a PhD in Planetary Science and I'm planning to submit my thesis at the end of March, but I'm currently applying for postdocs and so I'd like to plan for the specs I might need in the future. My work at the moment primarily concerns spectral modelling/retrievals, although I wouldn't discount ending up running photochemical/microphysical models or simple GCMs in the future. I'm looking for the following features in particular:

\- Dual boot (Windows and Linux), PLEASE NO MACS IF POSSIBLE AS I HATE MACS. 

\- Able to run MATLAB without taking up too much processing power and slowing my computer down (which it does on my current computer).

\- Able to run several retrieval algorithms (not particularly memory-intensive) in parallel in the background, each on separate cores (how many cores could I realistically have on a moderately-priced laptop?). At the moment I just ssh to my office computer to run things on the clusters, but demand on the clusters tends to be very high and I want to be able to run a few programs on my own laptop if there's too much traffic.

\- Generally sturdy and won't get really slow when loading webpages with lots of graphics on them.

What can a high schooler meaningfully do in the field of Astrophysics?,1544469695,"Hello, 

I am a senior in high school, and I am enrolled in a class where we basically choose a topic we hope to study in college, do loads of research over it, interview people in the field, and create a final product in that field. An example of this would be someone with an interest in special education creating a theater class with special needs children. 

I have chosen astrophysics, and I have been on the fence as to what would be a challenging, meaningful final product that I could reasonably create. A faux research paper would be lackluster, and I truly do not know enough about the actual equations involved in a lot of higher up concepts for it to be more than a copy of something out of a book. 

I had another idea, which was using my telescope, a camera, and a few other resources to try and prove Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and see how each of our observations and equations matched up.

I have a question about processing data received from space telescopes (like the [HST](http://hla.stsci.edu/hlaview.html) in this example).

I found some [tutorials](http://hubblesite.org/get_involved/hubble_image_processors/) for the software [FITS](https://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/download_v301/), which is only available for MAC or Windows and it is basically a Photoshop plugin.

All of the starlight ever produced calculated by scientists,1544104165,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mio7w9mawn221.jpg

[by Kerry Hebden](https://room.eu.com/contributors/Dr-Kerry-Hebden)

If you have ever wondered how much starlight reaches Earth from the billions upon billions of stars that have populated the Universe since its beginnings, then you might be surprised to know that excluding the light which comes from our own sun and galaxy, the rest is equivalent to the light from a 60-watt light bulb viewed in complete darkness from about four kilometres (2.5 miles) away.

If the answer seems somewhat unimpressive, the actual number of photons (particles of visible light) behind this dim-sounding analogy, is anything but underwhelming. According to new measurements by a team at Clemson University, Florida, the number of photons that escaped into space after being emitted by stars translates to 4 x 1084. To put that into context that is the number four followed by 84 zeros!

Despite this staggeringly large number, the reason we see so little of the light is because the Universe is almost incomprehensibly huge and the photons have a lot of room to spread out in. With the exception of the glow from our Moon, some visible stars and the ethereal glimmer of the Milky Way, this is also the reason why the sky is dark at night.

To calculate all of the starlight ever produced throughout the history of the observable Universe, the team analysed nine years worth of gamma-ray output from 739 blazars — galaxies with monster black holes at their centres — and their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL) by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope; a feat that has never been done before, said Marco Ajello, lead author of a recent research paper submitted to Science.

The EBL can be described as a cosmic fog composed of all the ultraviolet, visible and infrared light emitted by stars or from dust surrounding stellar sources. Gamma rays on the other hand are the most energetic form of light. They are so energetic, that when they collide with light of the right frequency they can convert into matter through Albert Einstein’s famous equation E=mc2.

When gamma rays collide with the cosmic fog, they leave an observable imprint, which allows the density of the fog to be measured not just at a given place but also at a given time in the history of the Universe.

“Gamma-ray photons traveling through a fog of starlight have a large probability of being absorbed,” said Ajello. “By measuring how many photons have been absorbed, we were able to measure how thick the fog was and also measure, as a function of time, how much light there was in the entire range of wavelengths.”

Time was measured in blocks of billion years, so the total amount of starlight of one billion years ago, two billion years ago, seven billion years ago, etc. — all the way back to when the first stars were forming. “This allowed us to reconstruct the EBL and determine the star-formation history of the Universe in a more effective manner than had been achieved before,” said postdoctoral fellow Vaidehi Paliya.

Part of the analysis showed that the peak of star formation occurred around 10 billion years ago and although new stars are continually created — seven new stars are born in our Milky Way galaxy every year for example — stars are not being produced at such a prolific rate as they once were.

It also places important new limits on the amount of starlight scientists expect to see in those first billion years — an interesting, but largely unexplored epoch in the Universe that has not yet been probed by current satellites. “Our measurement allows us to peek inside \[this epoch\],” concludes Ajello. “Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang. This is our ultimate goal.”

Computer Programming and Astrophysics,1544053944,"Hello All,

Forgive me if this is a stupid question (yes there are such things). My dad is exceptionally smart - he has a degree in physics, was a software engineer for 30+ years, and is now retired and loves learning all kinds of new things in the physics/computer science world. He recently took an online DiffEq/Linear Algebra course to ""refresh his memory"". He is highly fluent in almost all programming languages, including Assembly. He recently purchased a book on the programming used in the Apollo missions and learns this stuff for fun. Are there any good books anyone can recommend for someone with his skill level that would incorporate computer programming and astrophysics? As much as I love science, this stuff is just way over my head. Google searches haven't really proved fruitful. Please be nice - if you are a member of this forum you're probably a lot smarter than me, and I know I get frustrated dealing with people a lot less smart than myself, so I get it. Just trying to think of something to get my dad that he will appreciate and enjoy. Merry Holidays!

Formation of planets and stars (Black holes and steller hurricanes!?! previous version),1543978014,"&amp;#x200B;

 Dark nebulia clouds condense together and start to build rotation as net negative and net positive charged clouds 

&amp;#x200B;

Rotation continues as clouds begin to resemble a hurricane 

&amp;#x200B;

In space there is minimal resistance, so spinning nebula build up momentum quickly and push towards center 

&amp;#x200B;

The center eye wall heats from friction as particles are pushed together, as velocity reaches certain point nuclear fusion begins 

&amp;#x200B;

As nuclear fusion is reached, the electromagnetic field is created around the core rxn 

&amp;#x200B;

The star is now a star and begins to devour the nebulia as it grows and procures its fuel (hydrogen and later helium) 

&amp;#x200B;

Continues expansion until reaching its largest point as a red giant 

&amp;#x200B;

Begins contraction and center begins compressing with extreme pressure 

&amp;#x200B;

Center turns to solid state with greatest temperature in the star 

&amp;#x200B;

This continues until most of the fuel is used and all that is left is an extremely bright white dwarf 

&amp;#x200B;

As the rxn runs out of fuel, acceleration of rotation is stalled which allows rotation to reach its peak and gravitational force is greatest 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where nuclear fusion stops occurring and the star goes dark 

&amp;#x200B;

When nuclear fusion stops, the star is no longer a star, but a new planet visible to us as a ""black hole"" 

&amp;#x200B;

All particles in orbit are forced to equator as they get sucked into the center of the new planet (this is the accretion disk), which becomes more visible since the starlight diminished, but has been there from the beginning of stars life as soon as nuclear fusion was started 

&amp;#x200B;

At the center of the planet, the start of the electromagnetic field and energy radiating through it can be seen jetting from North and South poles 

&amp;#x200B;

The accretion disk is linear due to electromagnetic fields and gravitational force from rotation 

&amp;#x200B;

The electromagnetic field comes closer and closer to core and gravitational force lessens, as everything from the accretion disk is pulled to the planet 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually only thing left in atmosphere are gases 

&amp;#x200B;

The planet will now begin to resemble gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn 

&amp;#x200B;

As the temperature cools on the planet, water may become possible and it might become hospitable 

&amp;#x200B;

Earth has a solid state core with molten metals surrounding it that maintains our electromagnetic field and gravitational force 

&amp;#x200B;

Planets can be seen at different stages of life cycle Mars is older than Earth and Saturn and Jupiter are younger than Earth 

&amp;#x200B;

Even the moon was star before because of its gravitational pull on our tides

&amp;#x200B;

Rotation continues as clouds begin to resemble a hurricane

&amp;#x200B;

In space there is minimal resistance, so hurricane builds up momentum pushing particles towards center like a spinning top

&amp;#x200B;

The center eye wall heats as particles are pushed together and starts chemical rxn that starts burning the hydrogen

&amp;#x200B;

This continues until nuclear fusion is created at center

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This continues until most of the fuel is used and all that is left is an extremely bright white dwarf

&amp;#x200B;

As white dwarf cools down it becomes a ""black hole"" from our perspective

&amp;#x200B;

Whether ash clouds or metal core has cooled enough to make the center of star not visible

&amp;#x200B;

As the rxn runs out of fuel, acceleration of rotation is stalled which allows rotation to reach its peak and gravitational force is greatest

&amp;#x200B;

All particles in orbit are forced to equator as they get sucked into the center of the star

&amp;#x200B;

We see at the center of a black hole a singularity jetting from North and South poles, and a ring surrounding the black hole In the ring at some point is the event horizon

&amp;#x200B;

We see both as linear due to electromagnetic fields and rotational force

&amp;#x200B;

We can not see the particles follow the electromagnetic field because as they jet away along the field space cools them and no longer visible long before reaching curvature of field

&amp;#x200B;

As the star cools the electromagnetic field comes closer and closer to core

&amp;#x200B;

The objects in orbit begin to fall towards center as gravitational field fades

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually only thing left in orbit are gases and ozone layers form

&amp;#x200B;

Then water becomes possible and it follows Earth's story

&amp;#x200B;

Other planets can be seen at different stages of life cycle Mars is older than Earth and Saturn and Jupiter are younger than Earth

&amp;#x200B;

"A few questions about singularity, the big bang and the Planck era.",1542747311,"Good morning everyone.

I continue to work on the educational game about the Big Bang, and I want to ask you a few questions so that the game will be as scientifically reliable as possible.

1. I correctly understand that the singularity is absolutely homogeneous, therefore, did it erase any information about previous events, as well as the cause of the Big Bang? Is the Universe of Planck Era also a homogeneous?
2. Are there fundamental differences between the initial singularity and the black hole singularity?
3. Micro singularity. In accelerators of charged particles have already received a quark-gluon plasma. That's right, that just by adding collision energy, you can get a micro singularity and find out its properties?
4. Planck era. Is it different from singularity? In addition to the size, which is greater than the singularity point but less than the Planck length. And the rest is described by the theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed.

I study the scientific part from the books of Stephen Hawking and videos from YouTube.

Dark Matter Brought to Light,1542746259,"Modern physics has an unresolved issue. The velocities of stars in galaxies do not agree with the traditional theory of gravitation. In order for the velocities to match the theoretical velocities there has to be much more mass in galaxies than what is observed. This has led to the theory that galaxies do have much more mass than what we observe however we just cannot detect this mass other than by its gravitational pull. This huge amount of undetectable mass has become known as dark matter. There has been many attempts to detect dark matter but so far it has only been characterized by its gravitational effects. The following is a theory on what dark matter is and why we cannot detect it.

The key to it is velocity time dilation.

Dark matter is exactly like regular matter. It is only our relative velocity to it that is different. We can only observe matter that has a relative velocity to us that is much less than the speed of light. Why would this be? Because when the relative velocity of matter we are observing starts to become a significant portion of the speed of light special relativity states that we will observe time slowing down for that matter. Velocity time dilation occurs. A consequence of time slowing down is that radiation slows down and the matter becomes dimmer. The matter that is moving relative to our observation point at close to the speed of light is unobservable. (aka dark matter)

The mathematical models and predicted velocities with respect to radius are correct. We simply have limits of observation. As velocities approach light speed relative to our observation point, special relativity states that time itself slows for this high velocity matter as observed by us. A consequence of time slowing is radiation from this matter is emitted at a slower rate on our clocks. Our estimates of mass are based on observed radiation.

This theory would imply that slow moving galaxies with less density would be entirely observable because they could not generate the gravitational pull to produce near light speed masses. However galaxies with very massive dense cores would have a significant proportion of mass moving at fractions of light speed. This high velocity mass would not be detectable due to velocity time dilation slowing radiation and would occur between the slower moving perimeter of the galaxy and the also slower moving core. This would explain the phenomena of ring galaxies which have a very dense and visible core and also a large visible perimeter ring. The space between the outer ring and the core is not empty. It is full of high velocity matter which is emitting less radiation due to its high velocity.

One way to test this hypothesis would be to carefully compare radiation density in the proximity between rings in a ring Galaxy as measured from sources with vastly different relative velocities. There should be slight differences.

Hypothetical for a Fiction,1542576639,"Hello,

I spend most of my time on r/worldbuilding and have been working on one for a couple of months now. I'm trying to go into specifics of the planet I've ""created"" and have been looking at different categories of stars.

First, could a terrestrial planet (about the size of Mars) **potentially** support life under a K-type subdwarf host star? I have the star 0.83 AU from the planet

If yes, how far would this planet have to be? How would this affect the magnetic field of the planet? What about the presence of elements? Honestly any specifics added if this was possible would be so greatly appreciated.

If no, what stars, not including G type dwarf stars, could potentially support life?

I'm not trying to go SUPER deep, and in truth, my characters won't be aware of the specifics of this world. I'm only doing this because it bothers me not having answers to these things and I'd like to avoid the stereotypical ""my planet is an Earth-like planet"" trope.

A new look at Gravitational Lensing and Universal Expansion.,1542391235,"I had this thought that maybe the phenomenon we know as universal expansion is a bit different than we currently understand it.  Instead of the linear distance between us and distant galaxies expanding, perhaps it's the distance in time between us that is expanding.  As space-time is more frequently viewed as a single entity, (like looking at color and brightness of 1 light), it becomes more logical to keep the two bound together.  If this is true, then perhaps the phenomenon know as Gravitational Lensing isn't so much a manipulation of light, as it is of time.  This makes sense as relativity shows us that gravity does manipulate time.  ",astrophysics,CommonCent,/r/astrophysics/comments/9xoir3/a_new_look_at_gravitational_lensing_and_universal/,1

Please allow my brain to vomit some thoughts,1542140421,"I am not a physicist, or even a scientist.  I have no formal education for such things, but I do spend a sad amount of time trying to comprehend the world around me.  This past year or so, I've been attempting to formulate a hypothesis regarding the relationship between the passage of time and the expansion of the universe.  More specifically, not truly a relationship between the two, but rather that they are the same thing.....that the expansion of the universe is really not expansion, but rather just the passage of time.  It's pretty understood, I believe, that time isn't  what or how we imagine it in our limited linear human brains.  I've been under the belief that somehow, universal expansion is the closest we've come to actually observing time.  I'm certain my identifying these two concepts as a single thing is not unique, and I'm not trying to credit myself with some ""great theory"".  I'm just trying to comprehend, well, everything. Please read on

&amp;#x200B;

I've had trouble reconciling this universal expansion.  Being mostly empty space, I kept throwing around this idea that EVERYTHING is expanding.... all celestial bodies, you, me, everything.  If all things expand at the same rate, there would be nothing to relate that expansion to, so we would observe no change (or so I thought).  But that never sat right with me.  It makes sense to me that, if this were true, larger objects would appear to ""grow"" faster than smaller objects.  As this is certainly not the case, I've been trying to ""fix"" the flaw in this theory.  Today, I may have taken the next step, moving my understanding forward ever so slightly.  Again, I'm not claiming to have though of something unique here, as I'm sure real scientists have not only worked out these possibilities, but understand the science behind them far better than I.  Regardless, here's what I came up with:

&amp;#x200B;

Space-time ins't expanding at all.... It's an oscillation (as everything in nature seems to do).  What makes the oscillation of space-time unique and difficult for us to observe, is that it's oscillating outward from all points simultaneously.  What we observe as universal expansion is really more like, well, surfing, for lack of better analogy.  This idea of ""outward from all points"" points to an unobserved dimension (I'll have to chew on that for a little bit).  It also brings me a step closer to reconciling another concept I've had difficulty with.....

&amp;#x200B;

Gravity!  I've been uncertain on gravity... I had this weak idea that gravity was really a ""pushing"" force of space-time trying to re-occupy the space that matter currently inhabits.....where space-time is more densely compacted immediately around where it is displaced.  Kind of like a tennis ball between two memory foam mattresses.  The foam around the ball is all squished......as it pushes back to reach it's normal equilibrium,  we experience this effect as gravity.  This concept had some major flaws however.  Seems as though, again objects being mostly empty space, there should be an almost equal amount of force pushing out as in.    I look forward to contemplating how the oscillation of space-time could be implicated in how we experience gravity......perhaps related to the disruption of space-times ""normal"" oscillation.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I know this shit is all half-baked, uneducated ramblings with no science, or even basic math to back it up.  Part of this is really just an exercise to organize my thoughts.  If you read all of this, I hope it didn't make you dumber.  I do however encourage anyone to comment on and/or discuss these ideas or your own.

Idea for space travel,1539860036,"This would be a massive space station of an appropriate size for this idea (maybe the size of an apartment building, if not bigger).

Looking Back At A Younger Cosmos By Phil Jones,1539820809,"F​or want of a better appellation, so-called dark energy has become the term selected  to describe the mysterious force thought to be pulling or possibly pushing the  accelerating expansion of the universe in nearly every direction we point a telescope  and analyze the collected data. While considering this phenomenon it is important to  remember that we're always looking back in time at a younger cosmos that is even  younger yet the further out we search. With advances in observational technology we  may eventually get a glimpse of the initial front of the big bang, the event credited as  the birth of our universe. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](acszhnj63us11 ""The Big Bang visualized"")

I​n the early 1930's, astronomer Edwin Hubble's observations depicted a ubiquitously  expanding cosmos and then two decades ago improved measurements revealed the  expansion to be accelerating throughout the universe, disappointing many who  thought it likely that gravitational contraction of the cosmos might be under way. Not  as of 14 billion years ago near the vanguard of the big bang where remnants of the  initial expansion appear historically preserved and still headed outward. 

B​ut during the past 14 billion years the frontier has moved on from what we currently  observe and we've no way of knowing where it is or what is happening to it right now.  Continuing accelerated expansion would put it far further away than double the 14  billion light year distance we now see. Furthermore, ceaseless acceleration, which  seems to be the contemporary paradigm in vogue, will eventually challenge Einstein's  prediction that as any accelerating object nears the speed of light its mass approaches  infinity, making additional acceleration prohibitively energy intensive. If indeed this  tenet of relativity is violated the consequences could be profound. At the very least it  would eradicate any future observation we could hope to make of the big bang  frontier. It would be dark to us.  

&amp;#x200B;

![img](m24hoaey3us11 ""Red Shift"")

 A​lternatively it's also possible that the gravitational crunch has begun to To reverse  the expansion and may have even been under way for eons before we become aware  of it. To reiterate: we've no way of knowing what's occurring out there right now and  we won't for a long time. The distances are vast and the light, which informs us about  all those stellar objects and much more about the universe, travels at a fast but finite  velocity.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](csllnn644us11 ""Distant Galaxies with their red shift"")

&amp;#x200B;

F​rom our vantage point looking back on the entire span of 14 billion years of cosmic  history we can readily assimilate data from similar stars to estimate stellar longevity  and understand how a star's mass influences both its life span and the fate of its  corpus when all of its hydrogen fuel has been fused into heavier elements. We've  learned that monstrous stars live comparatively short lives and when their fuel is  exhausted, violently blow off a huge portion of their mass leaving the remainder to  collapse into neutron stars or black holes. Recent observations have found evidence  for the existence of planets orbiting enough stars that it is likely a common  occurrence. All these discoveries and many more have originated from observations of  the universe accessible to us and though subject to modification as more is learned,  they represent solid scientific inquiry. By comparison predictions, theories, and  extrapolations about the yet to be revealed evolving cosmos remain far less certain.    

&amp;#x200B;

F​or the skeptics among us who continue to question the prediction of an infinitely  accelerating universe it is fun to speculate that some day it may no longer be  necessary to ponder the nature or existence of dark matter.

Therefore, rather than there being nothing before the big bang, there was still a universe, but an extremely large black hole that exploded causing destruction to the current planets and stars and allowed for the creation of new ones. And due to the mass quantities of energy that it had contained caused the universe to expand (or continue expanding?).

Why can’t the end of universe happens via super massive black hole. To elaborate on it when massive stars dies they become black holes. they attract one another  due to gravitational pull to form a black hole clusters or ( supermassive black hole) even though given chance is very little there is still a probability of every black hole will encounter one another ( at the end where all the starts are dead ) to form a super super massive black hole where almost all  of mass of the universe.  The probability of forming such a black hole increase as the expansion of the universe slowdown/ almost stop too. 

When in a such a occasion the due to immense pressure/ law entropy could cause explosions that equivalent of a Big Bang which turn the cycle around and become the new beginning.

Steller and Post-Stellar Mineral Distribution,1537466291," Assuming a fairly typical star formation process, is it reasonable to assume similar distributions of minerals in the accretion disk in any given proto-star’s system?  I assume that stars will only form under roughly similar conditions, although the type of star which forms must be dictated, to some degree or another, by the materials in the dust cloud which birthed it (and, presumably, the actual mass and distribution of said cloud).  If a nebula/dust cloud is capable of birthing a star, what can we assume about the composition of the surrounding material?  How much does this vary?

Come to think of it, just how typical are star systems in the first place?  It seems reasonable to assume that, if a star can form, there is enough material surrounding it that some sort of ‘system’ will form as a result of the star’s formation and subsequent heat and gravitational effects on the materials invariably left over (and potentially ejecta from the star during the formation and ignition process?). 

For the purpose of developing a hard-science Science Fiction computer game, I am trying to devise (or discover) a fairly simple system to determine what mineral and gaseous elements are likely to be found in a given star system, given the star’s particular attributes (age, mass, stellar classification, etc).  Is there any correlation to be found between, say, the formation of a low-mass star (or even a brown dwarf), and the amount of heavy metals that is likely to exist within the accretion disk, before any major planetary accumulation has occurred?

Also, how much, if any, does planetary formation (coagulation?) affect the minerals that happen to form the planetary body (i.e. are any minerals actually formed during planetary formation due to the heat and pressure of the formation process?)

Basically, how would we know what kind of minerals to expect in terrestrial planets, planetoids, and asteroids in another star system, at varying points along the life-cycle of that particular system?",astrophysics,PerihelionWalker,/r/astrophysics/comments/9hhfjo/steller_and_poststellar_mineral_distribution/,1

FTL at time of the big bang?,1537136563,"Hello to all, this is my first post here and I apologize in advance if the question is less than intelligent...

After reading ""Astrophysics for people in a hurry""  by NDT (which I did enjoy) I have a question.  As he explains the first instants of time after the ""big bang"" on page 22 he is talking about the size of the universe in the FIRST SECOND of it ""existence.""  He says it is several LIGHT YEARS across.  That is creating a dilemma for me.  If nothing can travel faster than light, how can the universe have beaten that law by 31,536,000 times (for each of the ""several light years he is discussing)  ? \[ 60 seconds x 60minutes  x 24hrs= 1 light year...\]

how can there be something instead of nothing?,1536735666,"... but because there is something (instead of nothing), doesn't it logically follow... that there must be everything? Otherwise, there would need to be a reason why something, is not ""something else"" (e.g. speed of light is not slower or faster than c)

&amp;#x200B;

The only explanation I can think of... is that everything that can exist in possible balanced realms, must exist. Many different equations can balance. A balanced equation needs no input or energy, it \*just is\*.

&amp;#x200B;

1 + 2 = 3

&amp;#x200B;

3 = 1 + 1 + 1

&amp;#x200B;

1 + 2 = 2 + 1

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly... this universe is a single variation of a balanced equation of energy/mass vs non-energy/space-time (which sum to zero). Time does not exist outside this universe, but is simply the path this equation takes... like an equation can describe a curved line which has no beginning or end. This universe is a single line, of infinite other possible lines. An infinite universe, amongst an infinite set of universes completely separate from one another.

I believe the word observer is where the problem stems from, otherwise this hints at a cosmic consciousness, to be able to collapse the wave function. which.

"Interesting idea to me at least, let me know your thoughts!",1534205143,"Okay, I would love to hear from this thread about this idea.

Imagine you built an absolutely massive telescope that can actually observe theoretical people on the ground of a theoretical planet that is outside of our solar system, let's say a planet in the Alpha Centauri system, 4 ly away.

Okay, so now you start using this sweet new telescope because of course NASA didn't build it, you did, fuck yeah you. You find a neat little planet orbiting the AC system (I think we've found one there) and decide to check out it's surface, see if there's any cool scenery because your telescope is just that awesome.

To your utter surprise, as you scan the surface of this mysterious planet, you come across a similar looking telescope! You can see the entire thing and are kind of bewildered but you keep looking at it in amazement. You look at it for a while and then, holy shit, someone steps out of it! It doesn't really matter what they look like, but to make the story cooler we'll say Warf from star trek is the ""person"" you observe.

Now, let's say that Warf and you just so happened to stumble upon eachother's telescopes at roughly the same ""time"" and as Warf steps out of his telescope, he holds up a REALLY big sign that says, ""I see you! Can you see me?""

The light that Warf is observing which includes your telescope and you has been traveling for 4 years. Also, the light that you are observing which includes Warf and his bad ass telescope have also been traveling for 4 years.

(this is where I get a little fuzzy)

Initially I thought that from Warf's frame: he holds the sign up, has to wait 4 years + another 4 years to receive a signal from you and vice-versa. However, upon thinking too much about it, I began to think that this ""sign"" communication could be a way to ""break"" the ""time lag"". i.e. A way to communicate ""through"" time instead of waiting. From Warf's reference frame, he would be communicating to the ""past"", and to him, you communicating to the ""future"" instantaneously as if the two of you were sitting at Starbucks.

And here is my question:

If you and Warf can actually look at one another through the 4 ly distance, couldn't instantaneous communication take place at least in ONE direction?

I want to know what you all think about this or if it's just gibberish.

So i have a theory and I need feedback from someone smarter than me. This seemed like the right place to post.,1533879271,"My question is this: is it possible/likely that the big bang was the result of continual combination super massive black holes?

Now for a little explanation of my thought process:

First of all, we know that there are super-massive black holes at the center of every known galaxy. From time to time, matter in the galaxy will make its way towards the center, and the black hole will start to “feed,” absorbing massive amounts of gas, stars, space debris, etc.

So my theory works like this: As these super-massive black holes feed from time to time over the course of billions/trillions of years, they will consume the entire galaxy that orbits them (seems like the only possible outcome, right? I mean eventually all orbits degrade). And then the black hole will be massive enough to start attracting other galaxies and black holes from further away and will grow into ultra-massive galaxies. Then these ultra-massive black holes will begin to combine (cause it’s just gravity right? Like the more massive the object the further the “reach” of its gravitational field)…..and as the black holes keep feeding on each other they eventually reach a critical mass. When 2 black holes of critical mass collide….big bang.

I think this satisfies a couple issues with the big bang theory:

1. We don’t have an explanation as to how virtually infinite mass was concentrated in a virtually volumeless area: if ultra-massive black holes combined with each other, their density would increase with each combination, compressing the matter more and more.

2. We don’t have mechanism to cause the bang: the combination of 2 black holes of critical mass, I think, could cause a massive explosion. Just like 2 pool balls smacking into each other at 100 miles an hour? This huge energy release could possibly be enough to allow matter to escape the enormous gravitational field.

Problems with my theory:

1. No accounting for the interconnected nature of space and time. Unless a sufficiently massive black hole could exert an attracting force on what we call “time.” I guess it’s possible. We know that a black hole can warp the fabric of space-time. Maybe a black hole with the density of an entire universe could even absorb that fabric?

Last point: everything in nature seems to operate off of some sort of cycle. This would fit that paradigm as our universe would be in continual flux between expanding and contracting; creation and destruction.

Grandfather Paradox Solution (?),1533809271,"""If you go back in time to kill your grandfather, this means you will never be born, which means you could never kill your grandfather."" This paradox is easily explainable. Yes, you do kill your grandfather. However, in your specific timeline a future version of you did not kill your grandfather, meaning that you are alive. The timeline you travel into to kill your grandfather is another timeline to the one you were born into. Therefore when you kill your grandfather and travel back to the present, your self (IN THAT TIMELINE) will not exist. However, you, from another timeline, will exist - in that timeline.

My theory of tears within the universe.,1533734398,"So since the universe is always expanding, I believe that there are tears that open up within it. However, because it is nonexistence, we aren't affect by it and we will never notice it. The effect this has on the universe, however, is that the Universe must shrink to keep the nonexistent pocket infinitely small.

So basically the universe's expansion is counteracted by these tears in it.

I have no proof, mathematical or scientific, but I believe it might make some sense.

Help a prospective astronomy student out!,1533653779,"Hello, r/astrophysics community! I come with maybe a slightly off-topic question. 

I am currently a rising senior in a high school in Pennsylvania and have been dreaming of an astrophysics career for a really long time now. I have done a good amount of self-study and research about topics in astronomy (Wikipedia binging and arxiv.org as well as some astrobites.org), participated in competitions (science olympiad and the USAAAO), and have read through a good amount of Carroll and Ostlie. But, it is finally time for me to begin applying to colleges and plan for my future. 

My question is this: what are some of the things I should be looking for in a college? What are some of the well-known undergraduate physics/astronomy programs that also offer research experience? My goal is to eventually obtain a PhD, so what would be the logical steps to take to get there?

Currently, I’m looking into these colleges: Princeton, UPenn, University of Maryland, University of Michigan, University of Pittsburg.

Ideally, I would go to Caltech, but I need to consider financial aid, and the from the ones I have listed, my number 1 choice would be Princeton for its aid.

The fundimental substruture of reality,1533604784,"I don't really know where to begin. there is so much, but here goes. going into this remember “For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope.”― [**Albert Einstein**](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9810.Albert_Einstein)   


 Okay here goes, is time a  field that overlaps with space, thus space time is not space-time but space and time. two distinct different things. they collate very closely but are not one in the same. If time is a field of different intensities, it will by nature only have one direction. thus this dissolves the possibility of a time paradox.  


 Next. why do we base our movement off of relative things. We have an absolute. 1 absolute. The speed of light. So why do we not call the speed of light a speed of 0. and thus measure our speed by how much slower than the speed of light we are moving, this would not only give us a absolute speed (which has never been done)  It would give us a better foundation to understand special relativity, and time dilation.  


Finally, is it possible that as ...... Information that loses energy, or slows down to the speed of light, that the information falls out of a higher dimension, into the lower dimensions that we can perceive and interact with. Thus explaining why particles sometimes disappear from detection in the LHC,, just to appear in another location.

Can a anti-paradox machine be created?,1532865015,"So I've recently saw a comment on a Vox video about time traveling to kill baby Hitler on YouTube. The video touches time traveling, butterfly-effects, paradoxical and history structure and how it'd be changed by changing history. 

And someone replied, ""Why no build a anti-paradox machine?"" - Which begs me the question, is a so called ""anti-paradox machine"" even possible to be build?

My reply was: "" How would that be possible? Let's just assume that time travel is possible in the first place. You can use time, to go back in time or into the future. But you can't change the fundamentals of time, because without time, there wouldn't be a space(reality). It can be manipulated (meaning go back and forth), but it can't be changed. The way paradox works is that it's changing the reality of it by time, it doesn't changes time it self. It certainly changes history, not time. 

So how would a paradox machine be build, to change reality? Can you even change reality? Isn't reality just a perception we perceived? If then, wouldn't you just changed the way our brain perceive reality? Some sort of drug to (trick) us see the world differently, the live in a different historical world? ( eg. Inception).   So in the end, there would be no 'machine' to anti paradox, or a paradox-machine is just something to trick our mind into believing a different reality.﻿""

Expansion of Universe,1532784875,"I have been thing about this topic an imaging things in this perspective. I have stumbled upon some questions and i would like to share them, I certainly know that I do not have any specific knowledge about quantum mechanics or astrophysics, it is just out curiosity. And apologies for my english.

If Universe is expanding it should expand in two manner, linear or spherical (correction if any). First case Linear phase: this doesn't logically make me curious. And I don't take this as a base of any hypothesis. 2nd case spherical phase: So imagining a balloon expansion here,

the surface of balloon as the fabric of space-time. Initially the surface of balloon is soft any matter placed on it would have a specific mass. If it have a greater mass it can easily warp the surface, as worm whole!. as soon as we fill the balloon with air, (or expand our space-time,) surface start to get harder and the matter which was warping the surface till now, wouldn't be able to continue it. So two things happening here, first the actual mass or gravity of the matter starts to decrease (?) And secondly if the universe is expanding continuously like this balloon, any attempt to warp the space-time will be harder and harder as expansion continue. Maybe the first hypothesis is just a naive assessment, but im really curious about the second one.

Considering a point source out of which the universe has began to expand and is continuously being so, what are the properties and conditions of this point source. Is it dead, is it very well alive and continue to throw matter (or dark matter or dar energy?) outward? What is the characteristics of the space-time at that very location? is it warped at infinity, does it have such enormous gravity or anti-gravity? And lastly

What is the thing that is actually pushing the matter away from each other, what is this enormous energy? Or 4. Is Universe really expanding?",astrophysics,nikmesh15,/r/astrophysics/comments/92m5gt/expansion_of_universe/,3

I tried Google but this is a pretty specific question so all I got were generalizations that I had to extrapolate from. I figured it might not be a bad idea to just come straight to you guys and see what happens.

Thank you in advance, I'll jump right in.

What would happen if the earth and everything in our solar system except you, disappeared in the blink of an eye? You and you alone were left floating at a single point in the vacuum? Provided you had a space suit and went into suspended animation that could last indefinably, where if anywhere would you go?

I say you would basically go nowhere. You would stay put at that exact point in space because the gravitational pull of the nearest star, Alpha Centauri, would never be strong enough to pull you in, even over millennia or eons. And if you did move due to its gravity, it would almost be immeasurable over those eons.

My coworker on the other hand thinks that the gravitational pull of our nearest star neighbor would, even though the gravitational force is infinitesimal, eventually pull you in.

We got started on this little debate because I had read to him that if you were to shoot a bullet into the darkness of space, it would never actually hit anything because the mass in the universe is expanding at a faster rate than that bullet is traveling.

Anyway, without wasting too much of your time, could you/would you, please shed a some light on the physics involved in that little thought experiment?

I do VWO (the highest of the 3 difficulty levels of highschool) and I am in my last year, which means as a VWO’er i have to spend 80 hours on my PWS. The PWS has to be about what you want to study in university, which in my case is Astrophysics.

What I want to do for my PWS is measure the redshift of certain galaxies, and plot them out. From the plot I want to derive the Hubble’s constant to calculate how old the universe is. Reference video: https://youtu.be/wuPJ2R3n7kc
However, isnt this too difficult for me to do? (I have good grades in maths and physics, so I have the theoretical knowledge), however do you think this is practically possible? 
I have my own telescope, and i can go to a public telescope to do the measuring/photographing of the galaxies. Also i can get help from an astrophysics professor I know closely, but I don’t want to bother him too much as it is MY graduation project.

If gravitons are real, here's what we know about them now: The graviton is a massless (because gravity propagates at the speed of light), spin-2 (for stress-energy tensor reasons I don't quite understand) boson. Because the particle is massless, it would be undetectable through normal means, much like dark matter is. Certain interactions between large groups of undetectable gravitons could also create gravitational waves, such as merging black holes and binary stars that have already been detected to produce them. An irregular distribution of gravitons could cause the effects of dark matter that we see today, like galaxy shapes not matching mathematical predictions using classical mechanics. 

Another, much more hypothetical, question: Could there be an analogous ""anti-graviton"" that contributes towards universal expansion as per Hubble?

He argues that there is no reason why we should pick one reference frame over another, in regards to what is more ""true."" I understand that this is a bit of a philosophy question, but would it be incorrect in saying that the Earth objectively revolves around the sun? Thank you!

Life of a star clarification,1530303456,"**I'm taking Astronomy at a community college and we went over the life of a star today. I want to make sure i'm understanding it as it seems like a really long complicated process..**

So, I understand that inside a main sequence star, the helium byproduct of hydrogen fusion in the core becomes the core as the star begins to die.

***Is this because helium is denser than hydrogen and gravity is pushing everything inside a star toward the core? or is there no more hydrogen left only ""helium ash"" that take up all the space in the core?***

The increasing density of the core causes the core to contract. Denser core means more gravitational force on the core making the core smaller and hotter(because more compact gas gets hotter) until it decreases to the maximum smallness allowed by the electrons in the core(Red Giant Phase) This gas compression causes high enough temperature for helium fusion to produce carbon (triple-alpha process) at the core. A secondary byproduct of the newfound temperature increase is hydrogen outside of the core is now able to undergo fusion and forms a hydrogen elemental layer or hydrogen shell around the hot new helium core.

This cycle continues (without the core continuing the shrink due to electron degeneracy) progressively fusing the newer byproducts Carbon, Oxygen etc. forming more elemental layers (this is allowed by the ever-increasing temperature of the core). In low mass stars this process stops at carbon and eventually gravity can no longer contain the outer layers of the star causing the star to eject it's elemental layers into space (planetary nebula).

For heavier stars which are either born with huge mass or gain it from another star like binary stars (heavy enough to surpass the mass threshold aka Chandrasekhar limit) this progressive fusion of heavier and heavier elements continues until it gets to iron which does not produce enough energy through fusion to meet the force of gravity on the star causing the star to implode and create a supernova or neutron star or black hole.

***Is the reason that in a smaller mass star gravity can't hold in the layers, but in a higher mass star it can because the lower mass star is hotter outside the core (more energy)? if not I don't understand why this happens in the low mass star and not the high mass one.*** ",astrophysics,Pennybagz90,/r/astrophysics/comments/8uwbci/life_of_a_star_clarification/,4

Please help me rationalize my physics-based Anxiety woes,1529162181,"I started having anxiety attacks about 5 years ago. The past several months have got so bad I started on Lexapro. My first one was trigged by watching a guy jump into a pool on TV. I suddenly felt like I was him falling but couldn't shake that feeling.

I would try to rationalize it by telling myself I am grounded and not falling. Then that led to my mind wandering worse... ""Well how am I safe when I am on a planet that is held in orbit by a force that isn't something we can see/touch in a normal way."" I would then reason that away with the reassurance that even if something did happen that sure we would float toward or away from the sun which would be the end of life but we would never fall down because there isn't an up and down outside of our realm of gravity.

That reasoning seems to calm me until my brain kicks in again... ""How am I truly still when I am on a planet that is spinning around at 1,000 mph. Stillness is an illusion that doesn't exist."" That I can not seem to reason away no matter how much I try to understand how the speed is only relative to the huge size of the earth and how since it is smooth it is not even noticed. That one is really the worst.

The thought of a bunch of buildings or people somewhere being too heavy for the earth seems to bother me too. I keep trying to go back to reasoning that we can't fall if that was even the case. I also try to think about how small that area still is compared to the huge planet. How there are areas of land ""heavier"" with no issue. How the dirt removed to create that building probably weighed more than the area is now. How the earth has shifted over time to account for that. How we are a closed ecosystem and nothing is here now that wasn't already here.

Another random worry seems to be things moving or spinning. From fans to rivers, heck even my dryer or AC... I seem to very illogically think that something moving or maybe everything like that moving so much could impact the earth some how. I quickly try to reason with myself again about how small even all those things are compared to the huge earth is. How those things no matter how fast or many could change anything about the planet. My mind then starts thinking about bigger things like drilling, fracking, volcanos, earthquakes, geysers, even particle accelerators. Mainly the particle accelerator.

The idea that the earth or everything could just collapse on itself pops in my head every now and then too. Somewhat related to the previous line of thought but sometimes just on it's own.

Last woe is about the universe expanding... does this mean we are expanding too?

I appreciate you all taking the time to read this. I hope some of you can maybe add some more educated reasoning for me to draw from. This isn't an everyday thing or necessarily all these things at once thing. Facts seem to calm me down more than anything eventually.

I started thinking about the universe and how Hubble observed us moving further away from other galaxies ""proving"" expansion. What if Hubble was right but for the wrong reason? Not expansion but retraction. I think about two fish at equal distance swimming at the same rate torwards the center of the whirlpool, as the first fish gets closer to the center it would begin moving a little faster. Now it knows it's moving torwards a whirlpool because it has reference points but let's say it's at night and both fish are wearing a small LED headlamp. The first fish looks back and all it knows is that he is now further away from the other fish. It could assume it is being pushed rather than pulled. Everything in the universe is falling into something else so why assume it is any different at the macro level? What if the universe wasn't created by a big bang at all but is created by the flow of radiation (Hawking radiation) from the center of our universe condensing at the end of the radiations decay creating the edge of the universe by forming and condensing into the particles that form new gasses and such to create new galaxies?

First, sorry! English is not my mother tongue AND i am not from this field of knowledge at all. So please have mercy with me in case im using some word wrong.

Second, my question is a 100% fictive. Take my example as given and dont try to explain me why this wouldnt work to begin with ^_^
  
&amp;nbsp;


So i guess most of you watched the movie Interstellar. There is this one situation where they are approaching this one planet which is pretty close to a blackwhole. For those who didnt watch. There is a planet pretty close to a blackwhole. Being on that planet would dilate time drastically. 

Situation: You have one group of people right outside of the zone of impact from that field of gravity and one group on this planet. Lets say 1 day on this planet is the same as 1 minute on the transport unit. Both groups have a device with them which let them see the other group pretty clear (e.g you can see the shape of the body from the people on the planet)

Question. Since time is dilated by gravity what happens to what they see. They are looking at each other while they are moving. Is the movement for the one group slower than for the other? Or is it as i would watch someone running here on earht?


I am really sorry if i didnt express myself to a level where you can understand what i mean =( At least I hope you do understand ^_^

"Working on a science fiction novel, but I want it to be scientifically plausible. HELP!",1526893407,"Over the past couple years I've been very disappointed by science fiction. While there are full realism stories like ""The Martian"" and ridiculous \(fantasy masquerading as science fiction\) stories like ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" there appears to be no happy medium. So I've decided to give it a shot myself in an attempt to write something fun, touching and not throw reason out in the window in the process. Unfortunately my mathematics are trash, so I require some assistance. Everyone who helps will be credited if I finish this project.

The story is set around one solar system and interstellar travel is beyond their technological capabilities, so warp drive and hyper space are no issue. I need to figure out habitable zones, distances between planets and whether the type of planets I've suggested are reasonable to coexist with each other. If you're interested, please go through the following list and tear things things apart. Also suggest ways that ideas can be achieved in other more realistic ways if you can. 

Planet A: Muspel.

The most uncontroversial pick on the list. A small, rocky planet similar to our Mercury. Not really a big player in the story, but it would be helpful to know if mining resources from such planets is plausible with the right equipment. I'm guessing no, because of the heat from proximity to the sun. I MAY create special silicon based life on said planet later down the road, but that's just a thought.

Planet B: Oswara.

A planet right on the edge of the habitable zone in the direction of the sun. Gotta have a desert planet is scifi LOL, so this is mine. It's mostly arid and sandy, but has an unexpectedly large FRESH water ocean. Maybe from a relatively recent comet impact, does that make sense? Or because of specialized life forms that eat up all the minerals in the water. Anyway, the coast is the only green part of the planet and is actually a prime farming location from which large quantities of food are grown and shipped to other colonies. There is life across most the desert expanse, but it's weird. A type of animal has actually evolved to photosynthesize and comes up from sand burrows during just the right times of day, when the sun isn't too strong or weak. Like living cactuses! These animals form the backbone of the desert ecosystem, much like our plankton but bigger scale. Larger animals exist to eat them, even larger animals eat those and so on. There's also a race of intelligent bug ""elves"" that live like communal insects.

Planet C: La'Bruen.

Not a Jupiter, not a hot Jupiter... a WARM Jupiter. A small gas giant that exists within the habitable zone, and therefore has   \(of course\) FLOATING CITIES! But these are enclosed floating cities, because I don't think a gas giant composed of oxygen is very realistic. At least you only need a breathing mask and not a space suit to perform repairs. I need to know if warm Jupiters are possible, what kind of gas it could be made from and what color it would be. Also, it has three moons that I haven't developed yet. Cool suggestions for those are appreciated!

Planet D: The Shattered Ring

It isn't a planet at all, well not anymore. It's a strangely close asteroid belt, \(like the Kuiper Belt sorta\) and a home for asteroid miners, merchants and most importantly... SPACE PIRATES! The main characters of my story. Is it possible to have an asteroid belt relatively close to the Star? Would a large planet exploding cause that? If not, what WOULD cause an asteroid belt to form closer than the Kuiper.

Planet E: Baltiar

 Past the asteroid belt is a rocky super earth rich with valuable metals. A LONG LONG time ago, people were sent as colonists to mine those resources. Unfortunately the gravity of Baltiar is much stronger than we're used to, thanks to it being dense and large. So the first colonists almost all died! However, the strongest ones managed to survive and breed with others, creating a new race of stronger more durable people who have mined Baltiar for generations. What's the limit of additional gravity that people could adapt to? 1.5x? 2x? The surface of the planet is very rocky and uneven. I'm not an expert in plate tectonics, but I want them to be very active and push up mountains all over the place. The ground level is uneven, with many deep crevasses and some monsters to add more tension. So the colonists live atop mountain plateaus and ride elevators down the sides to mine for short periods before returning. 

Planet F: UNKNOWN.

Doesn't have name yet, either because I'm lazy or because nobody in my story knows about it yet. \*C O U G H\* It's much further away from the others and is cold, but not so cold people can't venture there in reasonably protective suits. I want it to be a snow planet that houses an ancient malevolent AI from ages past. 

The most important thing I need help with in relation to the planets is figuring out how far apart they are, so I can figure out the time it would take to travel between them.

Some final details:

Star Type: Yellow dwarf! I don't want to have issues with tidal locking.

Starship fuel: Liquid hydrogen from mining icy bodies and splitting the water through electrolysis. The electricity is solar of course. I also need to figure out the speed at which travel will be possible. I want this solar system to replicate the relative size of the earth to medieval people, Star Ships being the equivalent of sailing ships and almost nobody pondering the question of going beyond the known world.

Radiation Protection: Hydrogen again? In the form strategically placed water storage on ships, or specialized armor? Need suggestions on this one.

Bone degeneration/artificial gravity: Simulated gravity through the spinning of ship sections. I had an idea for larger ships having rotating living spaces INSIDE of them for added protection, so that all time off duty can be spent with normal gravity.

Weapons: Ballistic!

 Lasers, Plasma and other such scifi staples don't really seem realistic to me. I could be wrong though, if anyone as an idea for cool, realistic scifi weapons that would be great. Ship to ship combat will be all about blowing holes in your opponents engines so that boarding procedures can begin. 

That's all I can think of right now! I may add more later. Please destroy my ideas so I can restructure them. \&lt;3",astrophysics,Desuby,/r/astrophysics/comments/8kzflj/working_on_a_science_fiction_novel_but_i_want_it/,5

"I have a proposal that explains both the beginning of the universe and dark energy, what do you think?",1523742735,"Ok, first of all I’d like to clear that English is not my native language so I’ll probably have some grammar mistakes , hope you can all understand though: ) and that I’m not a scientist so I don’t really know where I should post it but it goes like this.
When we talk about the universe we can state two things that I’m going to use. The first-one is that it started from a really dense and small point that contained all of the universe’s mass. The second-one is that it is expanding faster than the speed of light.
Theory says that, when a black hole is formed, all of its mass is condensed into a really dense and small point in the universe (sounds familiar?). The other thing it says is that the gravitational pull is bigger that the speed of light, so using Einstein’s relativity we know that, inside and the black hole, there is space generating at a rate faster than light.
What I think happens is that, when a black hole is created, if we take time 0 (looking from inside the black hole) we would see a this really dense point with space tending to 0. Then, the instant after that, we would see a supernova/Big Bang like explosión, with space generating faster than light, therefore not letting matter come out of the singularity, setting the beginning of a new universe.
Now talking about dark energy I’ll do a fast summary about what it is. Basically the concept of it was created because there is an omniscient energy that is contrary to the gravity maintaining the universe from going back into a point so, using my proposal we can solve the dark energy’s problem really fast. Physicists have stated that a black hole can spin at up to 84% of the speed of light so, if we think about the centrifugal force that such a rotation would have if applied in a universal scale, then that would explain that omniscient anti-gravity energy.
thanks for reading everyone! please let me know what you think about it.

Is The Big Bang Theory Magic?,1523675627,"First there was nothing, &amp; then everything just popped into existence from a zero point. That part sounds like magic to me. Now it's accelerating off into the wild blue yonder to ultimately die a heat death &amp; then there's nothing again.
I'm not comfortable with this so could it all be the other way around?
What if the universe is not expanding but contracting. We might be just millimeters from a zero point (singularity) &amp; accelerating towards it. But don't worry, we will never get there. Just get closer &amp; closer for ever &amp; ever &amp; ever. Always has been &amp; always will be.
But you say, what about all the stuff at the observable edge of the universe that is accelerating away from us at nearly light speed giving us red shift &amp; such. 
Isn't that just what we would see though? As we accelerate in, all the stuff far away also accelerates in, but as it's further away it's observed to be coming in slower. So to us it appears to be moving away. Just what we see. In fact it could be us going in at nearly light speed.
If we could send Mr Trump to the visible edge of the universe &amp; ask him what he sees, I'm sure his Twitter feed would be full of descriptions of a night sky just like ours. If he looked back towards home he would see us hauling arse away from him at nearly light speed.

THE FIFTH LAW OF THE UNIVERSE THEORISED,1522800925,"""Counter-Gravitational Forces"" &amp; ""The Universe Cycle"":

What are counter-gravitational forces, you might ask?
•A force that separates all objects in the universe slowly - pulling them away from each other.
•Acts in the opposite way gravity does, as it is a repellent force between all objects of positive mass.
•The fifth law of the universe, along with gravity, electromagnetism, and both the weak and strong nuclear forces.

How does it work in relation to the 'Universe Cycle'? And what is the universe cycle?
•The universe expands increasingly quickly, as a result of the elementary particles in dark energy colliding in pairs eg quark pairs (similarly to the collisions inside a particle accelerator), which releases large amounts of energy in an exothermic reaction. This energy exerts a strong force that pushes on the boundary of the universe, causing it to expand. The reason why the expansion rate of the universe is increasing is because the reactions that are taking place also produce heat energy - and heat causes relations to happen faster as the elementary particles have more energy. This causes more reactions to take place, resulting in more heat, resulting in even more reactions, and this cycle continues. As this is happening, the universe is expanding, and as spacetime is an extremely flexible and elastic, this causes spacetime to stretch. Like all elastic materials, there is a point where it has been stretched too far - inelastic deformation. It could take trillions of years for this to happen to the universe because of its scale; but when it does, the spacetime will collapse in on its self at approximately 99.9999% of the speed of light (the fastest any object with mass can travel), collecting everything and dragging it towards its centre. When it reaches the centre of the universe, everything is smashed into such a small space that one of two possibilities will occur.

•A gigamassive black hole will form, containing all the mass that ever existed in the known universe.

•The collisions of every single atom in the universe would produce enough energy that the 'big bang' would happen again in the same way it did before - meaning that the universe is in a continuous loop of cycles.

[Serious] Inquiry on the relational affects of multiple black holes in proximity,1522182267,"I hope this is the right sub, as I’ve never posted here. I’ve had this burning question for a while now; and I’d really appreciate feedback from someone who has studied this deeply.

Here’s a burning physics question.

If the event horizon of a black hole is the point at which it’s gravity becomes too strong for light to escape; then would the proximity of 2 black holes cause each event horizon to decrease in radius (essentially pulling light/matter/energy out of its neighbor)?

Following is a breakdown to explain my thought process:
To visualize it in 2 dimensions with a fabric/sheet to represent space-time, weighted spheres to represent celestial bodies, and (for fun) let's add a toy RC car to represent a propelled body (and the steering could be immobilized to represent light).

The gravitational pull is represented by the slope of the the fabric. Higher slope will have a stronger pull on other objects. Similarly, objects with greater volume (surface-area on our 2D plane) require a higher mass to become a black hole.  This would be represented by a certain steepness. At this steepness, our toy car would be unable to pull itself up the ramp of the fabric. It would slide backwards unless additional energy was added (continued thrust if representing a spacecraft) to maintain position, but it would no longer be capable of exiting. 

If there were 2 heavy spherical weights to represent black holes, over time they would be pulled to each other.  Prior to heir collision, the slope of the fabric between the two weights will be lesser.  This essentially creates a 'step' that the toy car would be able to climb. Now, if the steering was immobilized, obviously a car pointing too near the center of the step would simply fall into the second pit.  However, an angled orientation could allow the car to escape both pits.

I hope that I’ve flushed out any questions regarding how this analogy relates.  If so, would correctly angled light be able to escape a black hole’s event horizon when pulled by another? And would this cause the event horizon to decrease in size?

2. Prestige

3. Prospect of getting into grad school (I plan to  study till I get a PhD) - from what I have read at a few places, did I make a mistake applying for the major I did and not the Physics major?

Stephen Hawking has Died Aged 76,1521012218,"Stephen Hawking, one of the most iconic astrophysicists of his time died today aged 76. His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

However, he was perhaps most famous for *A Brief History of Time*, a popular science book which delves into the physics of black holes, time travel and more. He also was part of many documentaries, explaining higher physics to the masses.

Habitable Body Around a Neutron Star Companion,1520027667,"The question I’m asking here doesn’t relate to these two links, https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07688

http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/habitable-planets-could-exist-around-pulsars

, and… it definitely doesn’t relate to this link,

https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/34910/earth-like-planet-orbiting-neutron-star

What I’m considering is the possibility of a more-or-less earthlike planet orbiting a nice sedate G or K class star that is itself a component in a multiple system containing a neutron star. The planet gets most of its heat from the long-lived star it orbits, though there may be effects from the neutron star that make it both interesting and perhaps marginal for human life. Interesting is good. Marginal is… acceptable for my purposes.

My needs for a planet are as follows:
• It is fairly close in mass to Earth, not a super-Earth or small-Neptune or whatever
• It can retain a decent atmosphere
• It gets enough insolation from its G-class(-ish) parent to have a liveable temperature. But not too much
• The ionizing radiation environment has been generally benign enough for long enough for it to have evolved and retained, if only in deep sea refugia, complex multicellular life
• The radiation environment has been benign enough to evolve and retain enough photosynthetic organisms to develop a more or less human breathable atmosphere
• Over the last billion years or so, the environment has been conducive to the evolution of some land plants and perhaps a few well-adapted land animals of some sort

Some things I’d need to know to make this reasonably plausible(at least without snapping the disbelief suspenders too hard:
• Assuming that the G-class star is a distant companion to the current neutron star(40-100 a.u.… farther?), and that the ns resulted from a supernova at least 4-5 billion years ago
• Could a rocky planet of roughly earthlike size have survived a supernova if only as the remnant of a formerly much larger body?
        •• If not, could a roughly Earth-sized planet have accreted around the companion from the debris of the supernova and any former planets it might have had?
• How far out would the planet have to be from the neutron star to have retained a decent atmosphere under the influence of radiation from the ns?
• About what sort of x-ray insolation would be an upper limit to retain an earthlike atmosphere and ozone layer for ~billions of years?
• I’m happy to assume frequent mass extinctions from the magnetically-accelerated plume of radiation from the younger neutron star’s magnetic poles, but how often would those precess enough to put the planet in harms way if it is currently well beyond that area of effect?
• Are there any questions I’m missing that might be stoppers? What are they? And what are the answers?

Finally, some assumptions I’ve made:
• This is an old neutron star. I kind of assume it’s cooled well beyond the pulsar stage in any case, so if that’s plausible, then we’d only be dealing with it’s thermal radiation and any bursts due to infalling mass.
• The planet’s surface is rather enriched with heavy metals(notably, radioactives like thorium, uranium and plutonium, but also useful things like lead and gold, but also stuff like arsenic, selenium, mercury, cadmium and a variety of nasty isotopes, but only those that could survive a few billion years. There may even be a few surviving Island of Stability elements that managed to hang about
• The lifeforms, at least on land and in shallow water, are well adapted to somewhat frequent short bursts of hard radiation. Less frequent longer duration radiation may be more of a problem…
• We’re talking adaptations like greater redundancy of genetic material, some sort of error detecting/correcting genetic code(either passing over broken segments to use redundant copies or maximizing the likelihood of rapid cell death for most incorrectable errors. Cancer is still a thing as are mutations, but for a given environment they’re much less frequent. Other adaptations might be to isolate elements like lead into thick cell walls, or for multicellular organisms, segregating those elements completely into a thick skin or bark or perhaps a parasol of dead, hornified material directed towards the neutron star. 
• Perhaps some organisms only expose themselves when the neutron star is below the horizon, and retreating into deeper water, underground or into a leaden shell when bombarded with lethal radiation. 

I know some of these questions are well outside of the wheelhouse of astrophysics, but it would be greatly helpful if the non-bio questions could at least be checked for plausibility. ",astrophysics,astrographer,/r/astrophysics/comments/81iso4/habitable_body_around_a_neutron_star_companion/,2

I'm wondering if it's possible to have a planet orbiting a decaying star that is letting off waves of energy and particles, at regular or semi-regular intervals? Would a planet be able to stay in orbit under such conditions? What would this planet look like?

Let's say its a rocky planet and that the star is the size of our sun or larger. When our sun dies, it will start burning helium, get heavy and  bloated, then it will shrink down again, letting off its atmosphere in waves until it is diminished to a white dwarf. So far so good?

What happens in the shrinking phase? Are the waves of energy and atmosphere so strong that they can push a planet out of orbit? Say the planet is tidally locked, is one side of a planet's surface roasted, while the other freezes? What happens to the planet's atmosphere? Has it already been cooked off during the helium phase, or is it shredded by the constant high-energy bombardment during the shrinking phase?

I'm wondering if such a scenario could exist in the universe for a short story. It could be a good hideout for pirates or, say rebels?! (there are so many incredible astronomical phenomena beside binary systems that star wars simply fails to even consider). Basically, I'm trying to think of a planet that, because of the behavior of its star, would be a place that ships could only get to in between waves of energy, and generally a place that no one would legitimately consider going.

What follows are a few proofs the earth is round and his rebuttals:

1. The shadow on the moon during an eclipse is curved so must therfore the earth must be curved.

A selenelion eclipse occurs when both the sun and moon are visible above the horizon. This means that the syzygy, 3 ball alignment, that is needed for an eclipse is not happening. 

2. ships disappear hull first over the horizon.

Ships go beyond the vanishing point of your perspective. U can watch a ship disappear and pull out a zoom lens and bring that ship back hull and all. Heavier molecules are nearer the surface due to the laws of density and buoyancy and cause more obscuring making the hull disappear first. Move up a few feet and the boat will reappear with the horizon moving farther away but not dropping in level. no curve there. The natural physics of water is to flow towards the area of least resistance until contained. Upon containment water will find and maintain a level surface no matter the shape of its container. All bodies of water from a glass, bathtub, lake, or ocean behave this way.

3. U can see different constellations in the southern hemisphere than the northern hemisphere.

Despite what we have been told about light traveling trillions of miles to hit ur eye, light does not travel forever. Man cannot see the entire sky above him. If the earth was traveling the speeds and distances science suggests parallax would be noticeable. The closer we would get to the stars the further away they would appear to each other and the farther away we went the closer they would appear. Yet millenia after millenia the stars maintain their same orientations and distances from each other. They tell us these stars are big suns, but through a telescope they look nothing like suns. They are each highly unique, pulsing, twinkling, changing colors and shapes. They are electic in nature, not burning balls of gas.

4. Eratosthenes placed two sticks 500 miles away and noticed the shadows cast by the sticks were at different angles proving the earth is curved.

Well first of all, did eratosthenes have internet, pony express, teleportation abilities. A ridiculous claim if ive ever heard one. The fact is a sun much closer and smaller than they claim would create the same affect of different angled shadows as well. No proof there.

5. The higher u go the further u can see proving u are seeing around the ball. 

U can see further from higher due to perspective and the atmosphere being less dense the higher you are. By moving up your angle of resolution becomes greater and objects farther away can now fit within that angular limit. Also all the mist, dew, fog, smog, smoke, and other heavy particulates are no longer obscuring your view. No proof there.

6. You can see the curvature from a plane.

Where is the photographic evidence of this? Some people claim to have seen the curve from a plane but they are looking through a convex window that bends light. The truth is it does not matter how high one goes the horizon will always be flat. It rises with you if not all the way to eye height when you get really high proving you are not on a ball. If the earth were a ball the horizon would have to dip below the original horizon the higher u went and one should not be able to look straight out and see the horizon. But u can. The only way that is possible is if the earth is a plane. An air plane flies in the air over a plane. no allowances for curvature are ever made. The horizon is horizontal. The only curvature you will ever see comes from space agency cgi and wide angle lenses that bend light near the edges. They even do this from the ground where noone thinks they can see curvature.

Question about the ramifications of global warming on the Fermi paradox,1515808888,"Sooooo I’m a lay scientist in that do no experiments but love learning about theory and applying it to my life. Recently I was reading a sci-if trilogy that would be interesting to any astrophysicist called The Three Body Problem, and it got me thinking about a number of things including the Fermi Paradox (which to sum for the uninitiated, is basically “where the hell are all the aliens!?). 

I forget the name for the style of reasoning, but it’s statistically unlikely that we are the first life in the universe if the conditions that brought about life aren’t a complete freak accident, and this is true whether or not god exists (if I might throw a bone to what I assume are the minority in this thread). This follows naturally from what stats is - a compilation of related data points - so that if there is or ever will be extraterrestrial life in the universe, it is severely unlikely to think that we are the first civilization, or even that we’re so close to the front of the wave our corner of the universe simply hasn’t populated yet.

We can see some 13 billion light years away from us, thereby determining the composition of stars through light spectroscopy, and theoretically, so can anybody else in the universe with adequate resources, to at least a degree equaling ours. As our computing ability grows with the advent of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, with breakthroughs in our understanding of anti-matter, dark-matter, and gravity, it is impossible to say currently with any conclusive evidence what the limit of terrestrial sight into the universe is. Therefore, we don’t know what the limits of any possible extraterrestrial civilization are either.

My question has a few facets because i’m not familiar with the astrophysics, but if we can determine temperature of a celestial body based on light spectroscopy, would another civilization be able to detect our rapidly rising cumulative temperature?


The implications of a yes answer to that question might eventually become quite concerning.

What is your study/career path or experience regarding astrophysics?,1515734533,"I am sorry if this isn't the place. I did not see a better subreddit to ask this in; please direct me to one if there is. 

I have been very interested in astrophysics and all things space/matter/chemistry for a long time. However my educational choices never focused on anything remotely close. I began reading some more serious materials in the past year and studying more about our world and I think I might want to shift gears while I am still young. 

I have no idea where to begin really. I suppose my question is- what career paths are there? What did you chose (if your job is relevant)? How did you get there? Where do you recommend beginning?

Some background: I am 23 years old. I have one degree in Art, several internships/certifications, and I am close to being a certified welder. I am taking courses in both welding and laboratory glass works (I have been blowing glass for several years now). I have been self employed for a couple of years.

Due to my course in following the arts, I have never taken a real physics class, chemistry class, or anything higher than college algebra. I have, however; done some independent study in Kahn Academy and related courses over the past couple of years. My GPA wasn't fantastic, but it was not bad. I recall my ACT/SAT scores being above average, but not high enough to have colleges knocking on my door. 

I understand it will be a ton of work, but if I start now, who knows?

Why is Space-Time considered static?,1508187647,"From what I understand, Einstein wasn't sure if it was static or fluid and he made his equations so they could be changed to accomodate this. 

Why is it thought that gravity ""bends"" the fabric of space time? 

Why can't gravity act like a ""drain"" in a sink. (Instead of water you have time. Why isn't it considered fluid? 

If it was considered fluid, wouldn't that accomodate for dark matter? If the fabric of space-time is being sucked into a gravitational field wouldn't it pull on objects like gravity would? It would make it seem as though theres more gravity than there should be. 

If there is more time, consequently there is also more space. It could also accomodate for the illogical expansion of the universe and how it isn't slowing down. 

Why isn't time considered the cause and not the effect. (Space does not cause time but time causes space.) Nothing can exist without time. Why isn't space-time considered to behave like a 4th dimensional fluid? 

If this is so, all events could simultaneously exist and we would only be able to perceive it going in one direction because we are 3 dimensional. 

In quantum physics, the particles that pop in and out of existence could be particles moving in different directions in time. Anti-matter could be the matter that moves directly opposite in time than regular matter. 

Black holes could be ""sucking"" the information and sending it back to the big bang, like a current. 

And studying the rotation of certain quantum particles is difficult because we can only see it in 3d when is could be a 4d object that is directly affected by 4d time. 

Why would space-time switch to ""time-space"" in a black hole? Why would it switch? Is it possible we only can detect time-space because of the massive amount of gravity? Why wouldn't a planet have the same effect just on a much more negligible scale? 

None, of this may make any sense, but I've been looking into it allot and no one seems to be talking about Time! It's all space and what's in it. I feel were overlooking the most important aspect of our universe. And our current model just seems wrong to me. Please enlighten me.

the unit of time,1506155728,"
  Time

Is time actually real? Time is definitely real for us, as every second passes, and the universe expands. Every passing second it grows at an alarming rate in all directions, always moving forward... However, I have been asking myself the same question over and over again, trying to make sense of the reality as well as the concept of what time might be.
WHAT IS THE UNIT OF TIME???
Time seems to be such a simple concept, every second tick by and you can measure the length of every process. taking the vibrations of atoms to measure the passing time as we know it.
Every concept we work within our daily life is quantified by time. Even Einstein's theory of relativity E=mc^2 (where C is the speed of light... in km/s).
The problem I have with this is do we really take into account the nature and fabric of TIME? And this is why I ask myself, what is the unit of time, a way to quantify it into a simple concept; other than time is relative to you. How we view time is dependant on the viewers' position in space like proximity to a source of gravity. Time will change its rate of flow, but not to the user, only to the-the rest of the universe, so looking with a big binocular you should see the rest of the universe in fast forward if you are close to a black hole. However, your watch will never change the speed it ticks it's seconds... Yet how would atoms see us? How fast or slow would we move to them?

This is all understandable and acceptable, but it doesn't really answer the question. what is time what is its unit because a unit should have the same universal value across the universe? So I began to think. How can I quantify time as a unit that can always be used irrespective of relativity, and this took some time for me to get to the conclusion...
When space expands time flows freely, but when space contracts time slows down until it eventually stops or very close to a stop, this would be seen as the ruler of time. on the one side, you have freely expanding space (expanding universe) on the other end shrinking space (blackhole).
When space expands its expansion depends on the amount of matter or more accurately the strength of gravity acting on it. This is the flow of time on the ruler.
When you move closer to a black hole or contracting space-time slows down until it eventually stops, or close to it (value/infinity). time becomes zero (expansion of space = contraction of space)
What might this mean? Time is the coefficient of the expanding space/contracting space. If space expands the answer is greater, meaning time flows, however the smaller the answer the slower the rate of time in that area of space. Now time can be expressed as a value and quantified into the energies of the battle between expanding space and contracting space (the unit of time becomes energy expended or WATT)...
This, however, might have other implications, this would imply that space expands (we know this) and space contracts (we know this) but now gravity changes a bit (Newton ""for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction"") so in this model of the universe space is a void that does not want matter in it. so it pushes back on matter and matter is energy so it wants to expand into the void (law of thermodynamics), now you have a tug of war that regulates the flow of time in the universe. The flow of energy from one system to the next. And gravity is not caused by atoms but by space pushing down on atoms, like water pushing on a balloon this could also explain gravity force between objects two objects floating on water has an attractive force between them. Almost similar to the simulation of the cannonball on the trampoline. ( I am a firm believer in the repetitive patterns of the universe, like a Mandelbulb 3D simulation ). 
Now where the big bang comes from (in this model anyway )... I imagine black holes form when space starts to fall back into itself. contracting rather than expanding into another universe, a cold spot perhaps caused by a point in space reaching absolute zero. no energy and thus no flow of time on the ruler. so it starts to move the other way. This causes it to suck in everything around it space matter, everything. Now you have growing bubble in space feeding on surrounding space-time becomes non-existent to the observer but in the black hole, there is a violent influx of matter and energy, a big bang if you will. but time doesn't exist for the falling matter in a way we can perceive it, this allows the matter to be at any place at any time.(if you could control time or ignore time, you could hold your own hand in an infinitely long chain, or web...) forming a whole new universe, being fed by energy from an unseen universe ""dark energy""
The space inside trying desperately to collapse and matter wanting to expand, but as long as it feeds the space will continue to expand and space will continue to compress the matter (space = dark matter ). and so the universe grows and expands soon forming its own black holes inside the new universe. This becomes a Mandelbulb of sorts. 
Each universe a grape in a bunch of grapes, each grape containing a bunch of grapes.... to infinity?

This is by no means a scientific theory, only wanted to put it out there to collect on thoughts, to iron out any wrinkles I might have missed. and the thoughts are based on current ideas like relativity and the universe inside a black hole. but I tried to work from scratch, to try and come up with a new angle to answer some questions that the usual documentaries left me with.",astrophysics,grapesoftheuniverse,/r/astrophysics/comments/71x6gr/the_unit_of_time/,14

If entire galaxies eventually collapse into single supermassive black holes, could these not explain the ""missing"" matter in our universe?  Could it not also explain why the expansion of the universe is slowing?

I realize that current estimates of the universe' age probably don't allow enough time for entire galaxies to have collapsed into these super-supermassive black holes yet, but suppose we got the estimates wrong?

The black hole at the center of the Milky Way is (I believe) estimated to be 100 million times the mass of our sun.  Imagine if it contained the mass of all the stars, planets, moons, asteroids and gases in our galaxy.  That would be a huge amount of matter with an unfathomable amount of gravity.

Alternatives to becoming a professor in astrophysics,1492824883,"     Hello Reddit, I've been contemplating what I want to major in in college. My dream would be to get a phd in astrophysics, however doing some reading on the internet I'm getting the impression that the main path towards doing any kind of research is to complete a postdoc and become a professor. Is this true?
     For one, I hear that your chances of becoming a professor at a university is very slim. And that phd holders end up wasting thousands of dollars just to move out of their field of expertise. Also, I can't really see myself becoming a professor. I am generally a quiet guy who is kind of nervous at the thought of speaking in front of up to a hundred students. So, is there a different pathway to find a decent job in this field, like at a museum or the government or private sector? I don't care too much about the money I'll make and only want to end up being happy by doing what I love.

Do most graduates end up becoming professors (which I don't really want to become) or engineers?

Calculating elliptical orbits?,1492305476,"First off, I'm new here and confused as all holy hell at the anime stuff, but I'll give this a try anyway since some people seem to be getting serious answers.

Assuming a high school level of math (I'm okay at following formulas as long as all symbols are explained - like what theta actually means in that context), I have a need to be able to calculate the number of degrees (from the view of the parent body) a body has travelled in an arbitrary timespan (say a day).

This is easy to do with circular orbits - 360 degrees divided by the orbital period in hours gets me x degrees for n hours, but this all falls apart with elliptical orbits.

Assuming a 2D plane, if I know the starting angle, the Rp, Ra, orbital period, semi-minor axis, semi-major axis and eccentricity of the orbit, how would I calculate the number of degrees in the orbit that the body had moved?

Imagine a (very long) piece of string anchored at the centre of mass of a planet, attached to the body that's orbiting it elliptically - the number of degrees the string has moved around the anchor point on the planet is what I need to calculate.  I don't need to know the actual velocity of the body or the angle of momentum at an arbitrary point, but if they're something I get as freebies as part of this calculation that wouldn't be too bad.

"I just wanted to say, this is my first time here, and coming to this sub only to see Isaac Arthur in the upper left has made my day",1490841401,"Let me just say, when I came to this sub, I was looking for a place to find respectable, interesting information and discussion related to astrophysics.  After all, /r/astronomy is pretty cool, but not what I am looking for.  /r/space used to be cool, but is just now full of edgy pictures of the moon or something stupid.  Did I come here expecting Girls with Guns?  No.  Did I come here expecting to see Neil deGrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan toasting some '46 (or was it the '47)? No... well, maybe a little.  Did I come here expecting to see Guilty Crown?  No.  

But most of all, I did not come here expecting to see Him, Isaac Freaking Arthur, the Man himself.

Let me tell you a little back story, just to put it all into perspective.  One night, home alone and with nothing to watch, I started to peruse the YouTubes.  As you all know, late nights are great for contemplating existential thoughts and watching Madoka hunt witches.  So I look up something or another about black holes on YouTubes, and I find some video that catches my eye, ""Civilizations at the End of Time: Black Hole Farming."" I mean what a perfectly captivating title... civilizations at the end of time?  Sounds pretty existential to me.  Black holes?  Well those things are pretty cool.  Black hole *farming*? I mean come on now, if this isn't going to be some kind of awesome futuristic shit then my name is Gilbert Gottfried.  

So I click the video, and to my despair, the video is half an hour long, is narrated by Elmer Fudd, contains a table of contents, and has the narrator asking you to watch previous videos first.  I mean what a tool!  This is video is going to be such duesy, right?  Tonight sucks!

But boy was I wrong.  By shear luck I chanced upon one of the greatest video series of all time.  

The thoughts this man has are extraordinarly out of this world.  This guy has to be one of the most intelligent board of elections administrators who has ever lived... I mean what is he even doing there?  I guess Albert Einstein worked in a patent office... now this physicist is just waiting for his time to shine, and that time is coming nearer every day.  In my opinion, this guy is going to be the next Ray Kurzweil, if not better.  His YouTube viewership used to be in the lower thousands, but in the last few months alone it has started to take off.  Come on, people, invite this guy to talk at events and stuff!  Come on, Isaac, write a book or something!  This is going to happen, this man is going to be one of the greatest science and futurism communicators of our times, and with his rhoticism, an inspiration to those who have fears of public speaking.  It's going to happen and you're witnessing it right now.  I mean the fact that a moderator on /r/astrophysics recognized him enough to put him on here is proof that he is rising in popularity.  

Anyways, I was just happy to see him in the corner of this subreddit.  Who put him there, anyways?  /u/UNIVERSEnema, /u/Rimm, /u/jaur, /u/perciousangle, /u/nootpoint, /u/astromaddie, /u/Orphillius, /u/Proctor_J_Semhouse, /u/TheEmbernova, /u/riff_satan, /u/drythroat?

[Anime] Planetes and Space Socialism,1488750332,"[Planetes](https://myanimelist.net/anime/329/Planetes) is a 2003 broadcast anime show that realistically portrays the near future of space management. With a city on the moon, interstellar spaceliners, and corporate space stations, it focuses mainly on a struggling department tasked with collecting space debris.

However, the overarching plot is the development of a deep space vessel and the resources it will put within Earth's grasp. The intention is for those nations involved in its development to reap the benefits of its discoveries. The smaller developing nations know that this will put them even further behind and keep them essentially enslaved, so a terrorist group comprised of members of these impoverished nations hijack and ransom the new ship for negotiation. Their demand is that all nations receive an even share of future discoveries. In the end, they succeed.

It was like pulling teeth just trying to get anyone interested in being mods, and the people who did finally volunteer just dragged their feet and never got anything done. It's been months now, and your worthless new mods couldn't accomplish so much as a simple sidebar. Come on, you idiots, this shit isn't rocket science (no pun intended)!! This whole experience has just proven that we were right about you people all along. You're just a bunch of whiny babies who like to complain when things don't go your way, but when it comes to actually getting anything done, you're all completely useless.

"Help with ""reading list"" for astrophysical simulation development",1487206004,"Hi Astrophysics,

I'm a professional software developer, and have a decent math background (BA in math) but not a *particularly* strong physics background.  I've been experimenting with hardware accelerated n-body simulators and I'm trying to bridge a gap I've noticed with demo videos that are available on youtube.

Basically, I can reproduce things [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoLe1c-eokI), but not [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfND82e-fq8).

The former looks like a straight forward n-body setup, lots of particles calculating O(N^2 ) forces between them.  The later looks like (maybe?) a fluid simulation, but unfortunately the author doesn't provide many details about his videos.

So I'm trying to understand what's going on with the more fluid-like demos.  Do these have a *physically* different meaning than the straight n-body simulations, or is it just visual sugar?  If the fluid-like demos *are* physically different can the community help point me to reading to get me from the basic n-body simulations to the fluid simulations?  Or even just help me with the key words to google?

"How do we define and navigate to a single, fixed, unoccupied point in space?",1487113185,"Here's the conundrum. I'm wondering if there is a way to mark a static point in space for navigational purposes. Nothing like for a spaceship mind you. I'm asking where is the Eiffel Tower in space at this exact time relative to nothing. On Earth this easy. We have latitude and longitude lines and relative to everything else on Earth, these don't change. However, imagine if you were standing somewhere and you got zapped out of existance for one minute and then brought back. You would not be standing in the same spot. You would either have rematerialized inside the earth or  are now floating in the vacuum of space. That's because the Earth has moved. So has the Sun, Mars, the Milky Way, Andromeda, and everything else in the universe. But we are all moving through the medium of the universe. Is there a way to apply static xyz coordinates that are relative to nothing but the universe itself? My own reasoning through this has brought me to the first roadblock which is that the universe is likely not static but expanding. If that's the case then your origin point has to be the center of the universe which isn't definable because we can't see the whole universe and in fact the center of the observable universe is each and every one of us due to how far each of us can ""see.""

Let's Get Creative and Brainstorm About the Possible Mechanics and Properties of Dark Energy Based on Everything we Know About the Universe and all Combined Data we have on Dark Energy,1487057079,"First, let's list all of the data we have on Dark Energy right here in one spot. I tried looking online but couldn't find anything except some abstracts on different research papers about conducting some sky surveys to measure data on observable constants against theoretical. Since I haven't the faintest notion of all of the dark energy data recorded I'm unable to start this off properly. I believe a proper start to our brainstorming should be to list everything known about dark energy, and somehow I feel the Wikipedia article leaves a lot to be desired.

So unable to provide much of any information on dark energy, hopefully others can help us out, I begin to start with my first brainstorming:

I wonder, what if the mechanism behind the force of gravity being so weak isn't its leaking into some sort of hyper dimension? What if the cosmological constant is right, what if a property of space is negative energy? Maybe the force of gravity isn't so weak after all. It contends with this property of space. This property of space could increase exponentially. With less gravity confining and compressing space, like intergalactic regions, space further repels and propagates more space further increasing its repulsion like a feedback loop. Dark energy would be an incredibly powerful and base state of everything. The weakness of the force of gravity isn't actually so weak it's just contending with the most powerful and natural state of the universe all around it.

Furthering these ideas, what if dark energy and gravity are unified and are the same force? Suppose the lowest quantum state of space is pure repulsion and propagation of more space, this is the more and most natural state of the universe's energy. So wouldn't it be more appropriate to refer to dark energy as simply energy: *the* energy. And if gravity, being consequent the accumulation of matter/energy and these being a sort of inverse state of the more natural lower state of space, wouldn't it make sense for gravity to be the actual dark energy and just the inverse of the far more numerous and lowest state of space's energy, the energy referred to 
currently as dark energy.

Now as the presence of space increases exponentially the force of dark energy. What if so too gravity within the confines, in sufficient amounts, of a system increased its energy exponentially. Within a galaxy of sufficient size gravity could undergo a sort of change of state, a sort of phase change, which locks all the matter/energy it contains into a kind of psuedo-one thing. Now the outer stars in this galaxy must circumnavigate it's radius at an accelerated rate as if connected to spokes radiating from its center. The stars now must operate in this phase changed system as if connected as one object having to travel around their galaxy locked together.

Could these things be linked mathematically and unify ideas of dark energy, dark matter, and gravity all together through one force?",astrophysics,Doctor_FatFinger,/r/astrophysics/comments/5tyu2k/lets_get_creative_and_brainstorm_about_the/,0

Is there a mathematical symbol to represent the span of the Universe?,1486688794,"And by Universe, I mean both the known and unknown universe. Everything.

**Just to be clear**: I'm asking if a symbol to represent the span of the Universe already exists, and explaining why I want that symbol.

Google keeps trying to correct me to ""universal measurements"" or ""universal units of measure."" I specifically mean the Universe; i.e., how to represent the measure of universal everything in one simple symbol, much like how x represents an unknown value, or ƒ represents an unknown force.

Perhaps I know so little about the subject that I don't even know where to begin my search. If so, I'd like to hear some search terms to use.

If this isn't a thing yet, I hope to make a symbol for the Universal span. (Ü maybe? If not taken.) Seems useful. I'm trying to work out the speed of the Universe, and don't want to look stupid inventing something which could already be widely known.

The reason I'm asking is I'm hypothesizing that because it's true in quantum mechanics that Everything (all existence) exists as a single point, that the laws of physics still apply to that single point. Therefore, because objects of any size can never take up the space/time of another, that the space/time of the universe can never take up the space/time of itself, so the minimum speed of the universe must be ÜC. (Or one universal span (the entire linear space of the universe, as measured by the direction of its velocity)(Ü) times the speed of light(C).)

Some assumptions I'm making are:
 
 1. The velocity of the universe is an entirely different question because I'm not worried about its direction, only speed
 2. The space/time continuum is real
 3. In a multidimensional universe, everything also exists somehow on one-dimension, a.k.a., a single point

A couple of notes:

 1. I don't want a symbol constrained to the observable Universe, but the entire universe
 2. I do want a constant symbol, like C, which was used even before the speed of light was confirmed.

I'm not trying to rock anyone's boat, I just want a symbol, or to make my own.

How do you tell if an irregular galaxy is spinning by its redshift?,1485998466,"I read that you could tell if an irregular galaxy, or a spiral galaxy viewed edge on was spinning by observing it's different sides and seeing if one side has a redshift and the other has a blueshift.

And is rotation accounted for when measuring a galaxy's redshift and determining its distance?

I know that everything is pretty much spinning by default, but would you be able to tell if it wasn't? 

Also, when measuring redshift, is it pretty much assumed that the galaxy is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium with a tiny bit of other stuff? What could you tell about a galaxy from its redshift if it had a significantly higher degree of metallicity than normal?

An interesting perspective on Universal Expansion,1484635609,"Ive spent a long time working on universal expansion and it has revealed amazing things. For example, the expansion of our universe is driven by a spherical structure we inhabit, as we move up, space bends back down. Interestingly, at the core of this sphere would be matter whose attraction to the center grows as distance to it increases, identical to the strong force. If we now move backward, that spatial loop I described actually appears as an electron orbital in an Atom. Its mind boggling, and the implications are incredible. For example, if the smallest object that is certain in the universe builds into itself, the answer to the hodge conjecture is that all object build into one shape, an Atom. Fascinatingly, the laws governing this Atoms structure are gravitational, meaning all matter in the universe can be explained and predicted from an understanding of Gravity.

Unfortunately I know most people will disagree with me, for these ideas do seem rather outlandish (are), still, Ive checked countless times and its the only shape that is possible.

This is also incredible because Atoms are electrical entities, yet they are governed by Gravity! This means we can assume a gravitational perspective on electricity, and as formerly described, the strong force! its incredible, and if it interests you, Id advise you to tell some friends about it and check out the shitty website Ive made for it, systemological.com

Please can anyone offer advice on getting in to astrophysics simulations?,1483791020,"Hi all,

I'm wondering if I can get some advice on how to get in to astrophysics simulations.

There's quite a detailed explanation below and I'm not certain this is the correct place for this post - if not, please let me know :) 

I've known since a young age I was interested in astrophysics simulation/modelling work. I looked at doing joint degrees in Computing/Astrophysics and Computing/Maths at Undergraduate level, but in the end I decided upon Game Programming as it allowed me to delve much more heavily into the programming aspects (software dev practices, C++ and C#), less of areas I wasn't interested in (e.g. computer networks and forensics) and also covered some maths.

I graduated Uni 2 years ago with a first in computer game development (all programming, no design components) so I know C++ and some maths, but not at the level I expect is needed to go in to astrophysics.

For my final year dissertation I worked on a computing algorithm for detecting stellar clusters within galaxy data, but I suspect that the outcome of this was basic and could be greatly expanded on. The astrophysics knowledge needed for this work was practically none - I had an astrophysics tutor guiding me with these requirements. I was offered a PhD to continue the work but couldn't accept due to lack of funding.

I have no astrophysics theoretical knowledge. I've been working as a .Net developer since graduation.

I've been looking at courses such as the Next Generation Computer Modelling PhDs offered at Southampton University (http://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk/index.html) and the Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering Masters offered by KTH-Sweden, Delft-Netherlands and Berlin-Germany and Guwahati-India (https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/cosse/master-s-programme-in-computer-simulations-for-science-and-engineering-1.44243).

In truth I've been looking at these courses (specifically COSSE in Sweden/NL) for years but I didn't really know how to get from where I am now to where I want to be. I suspect that my mathematical and astrophysics skills aren't at the level needed for this type of course. Would I need a second undergrad in maths or astrophysics? This, financially, is not possible. Are there other alternatives? Would I be able to do a masters in mathematics or astrophysics - firstly would I be likely to have the prerequisites for these courses, and secondly would these prepare me well enough for then completing the PhD or Master courses above?

I've also read that these roles are few and far between - as most astrophysicists have the CS skills themselves - can anyone tell me if roles in these areas are hard to find? I'm currently based in the UK and I'm aware I'll need to move for study - will I need to stay there/move again for work? If anyone who works in this field can offer any insight in to the roles available or the job market that would also be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much for any knowledge or advice you can offer.

Do wormholes pull you back in at the other end?,1483747096,"So I am clearly not a physicist - but then again I don't know any personally either. This question comes from both ignorance and fascination.

Let's assume that wormholes are indeed real. If you dive into one (or rather fall into one) due to its gravitational pull, would you not be sucked in again if you somehow reach the other end? In my mind the other end of a wormhole is another wormhole, the exit door of a tunnel so to speak, and therefore you'd still be in the wrong side of the event horizon. 

To exit at the other side you'd have to escape the event horizon of the second black hole, which is impossible as I understand.

I am currently working on an undergraduate physics degree at the university of Pittsburgh. While there are many routes I can choose to take after I obtain an advanced physics degree, I was hoping to do work in theoretical astrophysics, or any kind of theoretical space science. Unfortunately, the job market for such careers isn't exactly ideal, so I may end up switching gears to do meteorology. 
My question is in regards to the job market for physics as a whole. Do universities hire employees to just do research and not teach? I stutter a bit (not just when I am nervous), so doing oral lectures in front of a group of people may be an obstacle.

Questions about a confusing (IR bright) X-Ray source,1483242542,"So last spring semester I was taking a class on astrobiology from my university. One of our first assignments was to pick a certain star feature or classification and compile a ""top ten list"" (i.e. the ten most luminous stars or the ten highest redshift stars). We were supposed to create a table of basic data about each star to look for trends. 

When I did this assignment, I created a list of the ten brightest K-band sources. Most of the list was what you would expect -- nearby M class stars. However, there was one object that has me totally stumped. I can't find any information on it and I don't understand a thing about it. The object is J17143885+1423253 (2MASS) or J171439.3+142320 (1RXS).

What has me stumped is that its primarily an x-ray source, and yet has a K band flux of -3.51. My question is, what kind of object could be both an x-ray source and a bright IR source? I would appreciate some help with this.

Or am I barking up the wrong tree in that a nuclear blast wouldn't emit these types of energy waves at all?

Sci-fi story question involving transfer of angular momentum from one planetary body to another.,1482426054,"I have a short story written years ago. It is about an attempt in another solar system, to spin up a terrestrial sized  planet that is tidally locked to it's sun, by slingshotting a dwarf planet past it. I've asked various people, including a NASA scientist at a convention, but have gotten little feedback on this. The colonist in the story have spent an entire generation spinning up the dwarf planet and getting it's trajectory just right to swing very close to the tidal locked terrestrial world to get it to start spinning again. Is this at all feasible, even in a sci-fi setting? Can enough angular momentum be transferred  to add a day-night spin to the planet if done just right?

What I need is a solid handbook on celestial mechanics and planetary physics to give me a systematised knowledge on the subject.

Gravity and the Inertial Frame - a new theory on gravity,1481084108,"Hi reddit.
I wanted to share a paper I wrote and published on a site called Publish Research. The paper is titled ""Gravity and the Inertial Frame"" (an original work). The basic concept:
Gravity is inversely proportional to absolute (or composite) velocity. Simply put: (gravity of Earth) = (radius of Earth) / (absolute velocity of Earth). Absolute velocity is composed of individual rotational velocities from each inertial frame in which it is rotating.  Together, these velocities correlate to a universal inertial frame.

Here's the url where you can download the full doc:
http://www.publishresearch.com/

Direct link to my paper:
http://www.publishresearch.com/searchresult?search=gravity+and+the+inertial+frame&amp;submit=Go+%3E&amp;doctype=0&amp;topic=0&amp;yrfrom=&amp;yrto=

I'm thinking this is either total garbage (I haven't found anything new or novel), already known and I just never found the prior art despite a lot of searching, or this is truly something new and potentially profound. In any case, I wanted to share and get more eyes and minds on it.
Thoughts and comments welcome. However, please note that my days are busy, so delays in replies are likely.

Thanks,

--fenderphysics


Edit: Adding a little detail here to give a better summary of the contents of the paper...

The formula for the acceleration of gravity given in the paper is:

ag = (r * d) / SQRT(vg^2 + vs^2 + vp^2 + vr^2 )

where:

ag = acceleration of gravity;

r = radius of the planet;

d = density ratio of the planet to Earth (value for Earth = 1.0);

vg = velocity of the galaxy;

vs = velocity of the solar system;

vp = velocity of the planet as it rotates around the sun;

vr = rotational velocity (or spin) of the planet itself;


The root of the sum of squares of velocity is what I refer to as absolute (or composite) velocity.
The paper also has a velocity-based formula for escape velocity. Please refer to the paper for more details on the formulas, explanations, theories, a few predictions based on the theories (like gravity is fluctuating) as well as working examples. These aren't just formulas for speculation, they actually seem to work, and I show real calculations in the paper.

So, reddit and the astrophysics community, please tell me if you've seen anything like this before. Is this uncovering a new universal relationship between gravity and absolute velocity? Does it represent a new relationship between mass (or matter) and absolute velocity as I speculate in the paper?

Thanks again,

Alcubierre drive and compressed space question,1480114420,"To start with, I have no mathematical background in astrophysics, beyond an introductory course,  years ago. My question revolves around the  [Alcubierre Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive), and its theoretical application to space travel. Since the basis of the technology depends on the contraction and expansion of space, I wonder, whether it would ever actually bring you any closer to your target.  
Here is my problem, let us suppose that I wanted to go to Alpha Centauri, and we compressed the space before over that distance, and expanded the space behind me, to the point that my region of space, across the fabric of space, could be considered at my destination. However, I now have, an the same amount of space to the original distance between me and Alpha Centauri, and since all of our units of measurement are a unit of distance across said space for example a km, would I not therefor have the same number of kms between me and Alpha Centauri, effectively meaning, that to me, the observer stuck within the confines of space, nothing would have happened. There would, in fact, be the same ""amount"" of space in front and behind me, I think this would also effect light as well, which travels **THROUGH** that space. The light would still travel the same number of ""units of space"" as before, meaning it would still take ~4lys to reach me. My thought process could be entirely misunderstanding the interaction between the things IN space, and the fabric of space itself, so I am very interested if anyone out there, with a background in this, could maybe clear this up, or explain where my thinking is flawed.

a solution to the fermi paradox,1477368081,"when a civilization starts to gain the ability to put objects into the orbit of their planet (satellites, space stations, garbage from other spacecraft, etc) the objects start to collide and break into more and more pieces, which collide with everything else, making more and more fragments of garbage that destroy anything in their path, generating more fragments in an exponential factor.  (the Kessler syndrome) Civilizations effectively trap themselves in their own planets. Our progression halts itself before we become capable of interstellar travel. We are currently doing this, and maybe the reason we haven't been able to contact other intelligent life forms is they have trapped themselves in the same way we have.

Why doesn't the Moon fall down on Earth (and Earth on the Sun)?,1476285439,"I know - the answer is because both objects (Moon and Earth) go round the bigger ones (Earth and Sun, respectively). But why? If we want to put a satelite on the Earth orbit we have to give it enough speed for that to stay in the orbit (and not fall down) but not too much so that it won't escape. We do it by engines. It seems that both Moon and Earth are in their respective speeds sweet spot (as none of them neither falls on the bigger obcjects or escapes it). But why are they rotating? What gave them the spin? What worked as a rocket engine in their case? Is it, for Moon, the collision of Earth and another planet (billons of years ago) that led to creating the moon - is that what gave the moon its spin? What was the corresponding event for the Earth's movement around the Sun then? ",astrophysics,kanner714,/r/astrophysics/comments/574l5r/why_doesnt_the_moon_fall_down_on_earth_and_earth/,7

Is it true that we don't know why gravity works?

THEORY ABOUT DARK ENERGY (WHICH EXPLAINS WHY EVERYTHING ACCELERATES)(REWRITTEN),1473618243,"Hello.I've got a theory about dark energy. First, gravity does work. That's already known. Now, wherever you go in space, gravity applies a force on you but it's very weak. But since the energy in space is not endless this gravitational force will end up at a specific moment of time. So gravity won't last forever. And you can think it for electrical and magnetic fields too. So as time goes forward,  particles will be losing their features. And the difference between (eg) proton and a photon is gravitational and electrical fields which give particles mass . So the particles with mass will lose weight and their features. So as time goes forward all particles will be converting into photons. And since bigbang, the particles have been having a velocity. So they will accelerate. And the particles are going to seperate from each other faster than ever until they will reach the speed of light. I haven't adjusted it to relativity yet. I am waiting for your comments.

&gt; ""Ugh how come people with the limited/no commercial plans on Hulu get more programming than us that have the free version?""

&gt; ""Why do people that pay for cable have more channels than those of us that don't?""

&gt; ""Why do people with Amazon Prime get two day shipping when we're still paying for what we're buying?""

&gt; Some of you really need to grow the fuck up and learn that you can't get shit in this world without money. Beggars can't be choosers. You can't expect to get the same shit as people that pay money or else no one would spend a goddamn dime on anything. In reality, you're still getting programming on Hulu, you're still getting other TV channels to watch, you're still getting your item shipped to you, you still get to play Clash Royale with the rest of us and have the chance of getting a legendary and so on, so quit fucking complaining. You want everything we have? Then spend money like the rest of us. Don't have any money because you don't have a job or whatever? Then quit fucking complaining on Reddit because it isn't our fucking problems.

&gt; TL;DR - You can't expect to have everything that people pay for, for free.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; It's called the legendary shop, dumbass. If you don't have the skill to get there, then you don't deserve a legendary of your choosing.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Lol you fucking retard, most of us got to legendary arena without any legendaries and bought some I'm the shop. You're just salty cause you don't have any legendaries. Lol skill, you're just another f2p dumbass that thinks that legendaries are a free win. You're fucking garbage dude, cards are put into the game for a fucking reason. I could annihilate you at this game without any legendaries, you f2ps act as if you were the only ones that could play without any legendaries. Friendly reminder, there are millions of players in this game, a random bitcher like yourself isn't anymore special than the rest of us. Plus it's not our fucking problem that you can't afford to put any money down on this game. Why the fuck do you care what people do with their money? Jfc are you in high school or something?

Hi guys, I just wanted to remind you mouth-breathing neckbeard retards how pathetic your sad little lives are. You're a bunch of miserable failures who must have thought: ""My self-esteem is terrible because I'm a severely retarded loser living in mom's basement who spends my free time making anime jokes on the internet that literally no one could ever find funny. How do I fix this? I know! I'll find a sub where intelligent people hang out, then ruin it with my incredibly hilarious elementary school 'humor' along with a bunch of my severely retarded friends! Maybe the emptiness inside will go away if I show all those smart people how funny (read: retarded) I am!"" Unfortunately no one beyond your weird little homoerotic group of mentally handicapped manchildren will ever think you're funny, so you're literally just jerking off into the mouths of your fellow retard failures. You people act like middle school children, but I'm willing to put money on the fact that you're actually adults, which is the saddest fucking thing I've ever witnessed. How much of a fucking failure do you have to be to act like a severely autistic middle school child on a science forum which you decided to ruin purely to put something on display which most moderately functional adults would be deeply ashamed of? The hilarious part of all of this is that you're probably so proud of yourselves for driving all signs of intelligence out of this sub, but at the end of the day those people are going to have their lucrative technical jobs that they worked extremely hard to achieve, while you pathetic cum stains just have your little buttfuck subreddit that you stole from people who aren't miserable failures like yourselves. 7-11 is probably the highest any of you can hope to aspire for, and even that's a stretch. So live it up while you can. The astrophysicists who used to hang around here don't give a fuck any more, but your lives are no less pathetic than they've always been. I'm guessing that your little embarrassing internet power trips are the only thing keeping some of you from killing yourselves, which you should honestly consider if you wanted to do some good in the world.

12000 Lunar Orbits/ 1 Earth Day (sec)= Speed of Light?,1464507821,"http://www.speed-light.info/speed_of_light_12000.htm
http://infidels.org/kiosk/article/the-koran-predicted-the-speed-of-light-not-really-168.html

So apparently if you use the lunar calendar (sidereal months), the speed of light (c)= 12000 lunar orbits/ one earth day (seconds).

From infidels website:
C = 12,000 [lunar revolutions about the earth] x 3682.07 [average orbital velocity of the moon today in km/hr] x 0.89157 [compensation factor for heliocentric gravitation] x 655.71986 [length in hours of one complete lunar orbit transit today] / 86164.0906 seconds [one sidereal day on earth today] = 299792.5 km/s
I am not sure what to think since I am not too good with physics but I'm leaning towards the side that this is just a case of someone putting a bunch of numbers together just to get the number they want.

Can anyone confirm this I am very confused Thanks

Humour me,1461381780,"So it's 4AM and I've just had a - albeit amateur - thought. I understand that our current model of the Big Bang centers around what seems to be a null space, where at some point almost like the principles of vacuum energy yet without it happening in space time, there was a quantum fluctuation that initiated the big bang. 

Now first off - could this quantum fluctuation have been of a sub-atomic particle never seen? Such as one with an infinite energy potential that created the Universe we see by initiating some base reaction? 

Back to my question though and please explain if this isn't possible. I understand that the velocity of time was decided at the big bang, but couldn't space have existed before? Like....an analogy would be like this. Before you make bread, you have just flour, water, yeast and a little sugar. Why couldn't it be that space existed before the big bang and that the explosion initiated by a singularity existing within it ejected its contents in a certain 4 to 5 dimensional direction that projected a 3D area of mass that is currently 46.5 bn light years across? 

I mean, if space is truly infinite, but matter is not and is caused by the said quantum fluctuation creating an explosion in a certain direction, it would make sense? We wouldn't be able to see the other explosions or whatever else happened because of the 5 dimensional properties of space? Time being melded with space in the part of it we live in due to the reaction of the Singularity?

I find this all so very interesting, I'm a complete noob and have no real grounding, it's just a bunch of pseudo-intellectual stuff I thought up so go easy on me.

I've got some sciencey questions for you nerds.,1458007567,"Two stars collide. Obviously we have a huge outpouring of energy. My question here is, assuming there is sufficient mass between the two stars, would we have a black hole, or does that REQUIRE a fusion of heavier elements first?

GRB?

Next question: What would it take to move a star? Steer one someplace else. Obviously we can't strap a rocket to the sun, so how might a star be induced to alter its course?

One more for the road: So we'll assume the answer to my previous question is, in brief, no. In that scenario, moving a planet. I came up with an idea myself involving engines on a large enough rock and coaxing it into an orbit that, with continued guidance and boosts from the engines, would essentially tow the planet away. I envision this working better with a moon as part of the equation, as it'd be easier to sustain the ""dance"" required to keep shooting one out far enough to pull the others. My issue with this is tidal forces. Would there be a ""goldilocks zone"" in which you could pull this off without shattering all the bodies involved or otherwise causing massive destruction on the surface of the world/s in question?

Instrumentation or regular astrophysics for future career prospects?,1457755164,"Hey all. I just finished visiting the second of the two schools which have accepted me into their PhD programs, and after seeing both, I think my choice has been boiled down to one question which regards my future career prospects. I intend to place extra effort into developing my teaching skills in grad school so that I can eventually go for a faculty position in the future, preferably at a liberal arts school. I'm aware of how difficult this plan will be, especially with more and more students looking to do the same thing and competing for very few positions. Right now though I'm focusing on the first step - where do I go?

There are separate benefits to each of the two schools which I am considering. One school is a great standalone astronomy program with plenty of interesting research groups to which I'd be delighted to contribute, while the other is a decent joint physics and astronomy program featuring a seriously world class instrumentalist. So my question boils down to a choice between doing regular astrophysics or doing more of an instrumentation focus. The first school has instrumentation as well but not to the degree and level of regard at which this particular professor is working at the second school. Likewise, I'd do some degree of astronomy research under the instrumentalist at the second school, but not to the depth I would under a regular astronomy-oriented advisor.

Ultimately, which skill set will be more marketable for a future faculty position? I know that to continue as an instrumentalist after my PhD will require massive funding (which this professor at the second school certainly has) and so it is unlikely that I will continue that degree of research at a teaching institution, but I could potentially involve undergrads in simple instrument building or teach electronics as well as astronomy. However, my graduate level ""science"" would not be as in-depth as someone who did pure astronomy research. On the other hand, there are a lot more people doing pure astronomy for their degrees than there are choosing an instrumentation focus, so it could make me unique. Both programs have excellent opportunities for collaboration and making connections. 

Thank you to anyone who read this whole wall. Does anyone have any advice for pros and cons between the two options?",astrophysics,jsreding,/r/astrophysics/comments/4a2d4y/instrumentation_or_regular_astrophysics_for/,2

Too unintelligent for Astrophysics?,1456834139,"~~Before I start, I'd just like to say, I can tell by the FAQ that this subreddit is strongly against school talk, career goals, etc. But I beg you, PLEASE give me a chance to discuss my issue. In all honesty, I have no one I could talk to about career options nor my passion in astronomy, and I believe that this is the only place that gathers intelligent astronomy-enthusiasts and even people who are in the field of space who have a lot of useful knowledge that can be extremely helpful to people like me.~~

I'm a 16 year old boy and my college applications were due today.
I have applied to Health Science for college, which is a two year pre-university program. I did it for my passion in chemistry and science, not because I want to be a doctor. This degree will allow me, in university, to do anything relating to medicine, engineering, science, astronomy, mechanics, biology, etc.

I have always loved math and science, but recently math has been getting tough for me and I have been falling behind, but over a year I have gotten very passionate about astronomy and space, and have binge-watched every single YouTube video with Neil Degrasse Tyson in it, whether it be Bill Maher, Kimmel, Fallon, or any single thing on StarTalk Radio. I convinced my parents to buy me a telescope for Christmas last year and have observed the moon and Jupiter countless nights, the sight making me amazed each and every single time. I am obsessed with space and science, but I feel like I will never be able to accomplish anything and become an astronomer/astrophysicist as I feel I am only average and not a genius like Neil or Sagan or any of those exchange students in my math class who easily receive 90s and 100s, as I struggle to get my 80s and 90s.

Can someone please let me know if I could realistically have any success in this career path. Or am I wasting my time and should stick to something safer like medicine, engineering, etc? The only people I generally see that are in Astronomy professions are geniuses and people who are considered gifted. Because in all honesty, I feel like I am not a genius nor extremely smart, but there is NOTHING I love more than space and astronomy..

I have tried to figure this one out, but I'm struggling and was wondering if you guys good give me some help.

A star on the celestial equator had right ascension (RA) 16 h 00m 00s at what time of the day will this star be at its highest point in the sky on February 29,2016 (leap year)? 

Apparently we needed to find some more information, but unfortunately I have came up with nothing useful.

Where/How do I start do get involved into astrophysics?,1455848788,"Hey guys!

First off: English isn't my mothertongue so I apologize for any mistakes and ""weird"" phrasing.

This question might sound a little bit ridiculous, but I really would like to get involved into astronomy a little bit more. I would like to aquire knowledge that is a little bit more detailled than what I currently know. For example a little more details on backround radiation, hawkins radiation, wormholes, black holes (No pop-science) and so on.

I've studied biology (That included physics) for some while, so I know I'll be expecting lots of formulas and mathematics. That's ok. 

I've read a few books of Hawkins and enjoyed them a lot. Michio Kaku isn't mine.

So back to my actual question: Where do I start in physics to quickly understand astrophysics? I want to go beyond the niveau of Hawkins' ""A short history of time"" but it's not like I'm planning to do my Diploma on ""Hawkins radiation and black holes"". 

I always enjoyed to read about news from the ""astrophysics' world"" so I'd like to build up my knowledge about this topic.

Oh, if there are any books you could recommend, please do so. :)

Thanks guys.",astrophysics,Klavierente,/r/astrophysics/comments/46ifb5/wherehow_do_i_start_do_get_involved_into/,12

Gravity Waves,1455344662,"So, I think it is needless to say the official discovery of Gravity Waves is huge. Having finally discovered the existence of something Einstein predicted a century ago cannot be anything less than massive. Easy.

I plan to return to school soon to study physics/astrophysics, so I just want to clarify just what this discovery means. From what I understand, the reason it was so hard to find Gravity Wave was due to then being smaller than an atom, and they didn't exist then our understanding of physics and the cosmos would have been wrong. Plus, finding things which don't give off light (like black holes for instance) would be easier, as we would look for gravity, rather than light.

I just want to fully understand and appreciate just how important a find this is. I know why this is a huge thing, but I want to understand how it is such is a thing.

Is center of a spherical celestial body considered to be microgravitational?,1455228303,"I can't seem to find a solid answer to that question. The gravitational forces of an object tend to cancel each other out in it's center, but does that mean you stop experiencing the gravitational pull of nearby objects as well? I'm guessing that the center is only considered a zero-g environment in relation to the celestial body and not the space/gravity itself? Even if you float in the middle of a planet, you are still affected by the sun, etc. so you can't be experiencing zero-g, right?

-

If that is true, is the following link wrong? You can never float exactly in the center of an object, but you will always lean slightly towards the point in which the sun sits, for example?

"I am writing a book about a temporary binary system that I'd like to be somewhat accurate with, so I have a question for the pros here.",1454965007,"A short preface: I am writing a novel about a temporary binary system caused by an intersection of orbits that only happens once every million to the millionth power years (exaggerated but you get the idea). I'm exploring the idea of two planets with intelligent life at our current level coming close enough to each other for human travel and the subsequent events that would follow ( the species are peaceful, but we are not, problems include: religious issues, governmental issues, climate issues, etc...). But I digress. Back to the real question. This might be a better question for /r/geology, but I'm going to ask you AND them anyways:

Is it possible for a planet to have a mountain peak so tall that it reaches the planet's atmosphere and actually summits quite a ways into space?

If so, what effects would that have on the planet? 
On the mountain? 
On the orbit?
Or anything I might not be considering?

I appreciate any and all help you can give me with this little question of mine. I am going to be resorting to this sub Reddit quite a bit to finish this novel, so if any of you are interested in helping me please send me a private message because I would love to have a professional on hand that I could run ideas by to keep this novel as scientifically believable as possible (my background is in microbiology and biotechnology not astrophysics). Anybody who contributes a decent amount will be mentioned by name (or username whatever you prefer) in my finished book when it is published. I realize that this is not much of a reward, but isn't teaching a reward in itself? LOL Thanks guys. I look forward to any conversations we might have about these ideas.

X-ray data from pulsars - HEASARC. How to find a precise light curve?,1454201698,"Hi everybody,

I hope some of you have worked with pulsars before or other x-ray data from NASA Heasarc. I need some data showing a very precise light curve of the crab pulsar and some other pulsar. You should be able to see the individual pulses over time.
It should be something like this: 
http://cdn.eso.org/images/screen/eso9948i.jpg 
Where the time is in milliseconds ranging to 200 ms.
Or something like this: http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/pulsar/Education/Sounds/0531_seq.mp4 
The goal is to see the individual pulses, but hopefully in x-rays instead.

Then i should get a related power spectrum to the data, where i can determine the period/which frequency the pulsar pulsates. Something like this graph: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6691/images/394344aa.tif.0.gif I know these data i linked are unrelated, it's just to get an idea of what i'm looking for.

I'm quite unexperienced with the software related to HEASARC and i'm not very familiar with their data archive or different kind telescopes. I have installed the HEASOFT package. But since it is a jungle out there, i hoped some of you could help telling me what to do.

Which telescope is capable of measuring so precise, that you can graph the individual pulses on a graph, like with the crab pulsar, which pulsates around 30 times a second. Is it the RXTE? 
Where should i find the data in the HEASARC archive, and what files should i look for? Specially if i want to graph a light curve of a pulsar showing the individual pulses.

It doesn't matter if it's pre-processed or fully processed data. I should just be able to determine the pulse period, the change in pulse period (dp), and knowing which telescope and what software used to data processing. 
Off course i should be able to show the graphs too, and i should know which year/date the data was measured. But if i can make some of the data processing myself it would be preferably.

Or is there no telescope which measure that precise, when it comes to x-ray data, and should i instead be looking for data in the radiowaves.",astrophysics,nicklasm123,/r/astrophysics/comments/43gw43/xray_data_from_pulsars_heasarc_how_to_find_a/,3

Well, folks, this is a big one. Rapper B.o.B. has stepped into the astrophysics discourse with some controversial statements in favor of Flat Earth Theory.

B.o.B. later responded with a brand-new informational music track, in which he bolsters his providing additional evidence for his prior claims, in addition to some choice personal allegations against Neil himself.

Where do we stand on all this? Obviously, Neil is a heavy-hitter in the science community, but should we count the new guy out?

Orbits and stars post Big bang,1448606447,"Fair warning, Exact terminology may not be present. The following is based on what i remember from high-school math/science 10 years ago.

First Big bang happens. Boom, stuff goes every direction in directionless space. My very limited knowledge of astrophysics, or physics in general would have me think will, objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by = or greater force. On earth such forces could include friction, drag, etc.  
 My understanding of space presently tells me that there is no friction or drag in space. For lack of better way to ask, if in the initial stuff to be ""banged"" we have a proto-Jupiter, how does for argument sake proto-Jupiter get sent north, only to find its way in an orbit around the sun? It seems like there was a pretty substantial change of direction involved?﻿
  so 1) in absence of drag/friction how does an object start going north then ""hook a 90"" and go left in perpetual orbit
  Stars I understood to be stationary.  Planets orbit, galaxy expands, etc. if the universe is expanding (moving) then everything including stars are moving.  I acknowledge my understanding and memories are probably not 110% correct, Im asking to learn. 
   so 1) How do double stars orbit each other if stars are stationary. 
       2) assuming stars are stationary how does the universe expand and the stars sort of stay at their present distances? (I also understand that the moon is moving slowly away from the earth to at some stupid slow rate?)

The best i can figure with my first question is that while there was one big bang and then probably several subsequent explosions, the collisions resulting from various explosions provided the opposing forces necessary to change the directions of various space stuff.",astrophysics,sillybob86,/r/astrophysics/comments/3ufspt/orbits_and_stars_post_big_bang/,4
A Theory of Mine,1448420779,"The infinite universe is only one of many similar infinite universes. These universes are all housed inside one also infinite “multiverse”. Think of it as an infinite stack of papers, each paper infinite in size. This is the “true” universe. The science of parallel universes is unknown exactly, however it is thought that each universe may have similar or opposite qualities. Transport among each “layer” in the multiverse may also be possible. A black hole, caused by a supernova, may perhaps be a “rupture” in a layer. Black holes have a massive gravitational force, to the point of light having not enough velocity to escape. A black hole may be a “rupture” or “break” where we can access the infinite space outside of each “layer”. Since space is not a perfect vacuum, the space outside of each “layer” may, in fact, be a perfect vacuum. This being a perfect vacuum would cause very similar effects as gravity. Creating a black hole with a supernova is similar to ripping a hole in one of the papers of our stack. It can cause an object to “fall out” of a layer and potentially land onto another. The space outside of each layer is void of all matter, with the only thing in existence is electromagnetic presence, dark energy, and many other forms of energy. This energy could potentially break down the particles of an object as well, and transport them at immense rapidity to another part of the “layer”, thus causing wormhole-like transportation.

She asked a question that I could not answer so I bring it here.

If you are in a ship traveling near the speed of light lets say 99.99% and flew by a star that was big enough to go supernova just as it started to collapse would it seem to you that the supernova was happening in slow motion?

Can someone explain something about dark matter to me?,1447610722,"Non-physicist here -- I have a somewhat convoluted question about dark matter. I hope you'll bear with my ignorance.

As I understand it, the theory of dark matter came out of discrepancies between the observed motions in the universe and the visible mass those observed objects. Namely, certain galaxies seem to orbit one another faster than their visible mass could account for, hence dark (invisible to us) matter. 

I'm sure my understanding is pretty cursory, and that is likely why I'm having this question in the first place. I'm assuming my question has already been addressed by science and I'm hoping for an explanation about why this *isn't* the case.

My question is: Why isn't it possible that the light from the orbiting galaxies that we're observing (the ones that appear moving faster than they should be, given their visible mass) is somehow being distorted by strong gravitational fields? Or perhaps the image is somehow being distorted across the vast distances between our planet and those galaxies? Is there any chance that we're somehow observing a sped-up version of something that happened at ""real time"" long ago/far away/through a filter?

An analogy might be something like how our voices have a higher pitch when we inhale helium because sound travels faster in helium. It isn't a perfect analogy because c is constant, but maybe you get the idea...

Question : Black Holes have NO mass?,1446068309,"I'm just an architect, but while I work in design... I've always been interested in science.

Maybe the black hole ruptures the fabric lining the perimeter of our universe and another one right next to it, hence using the same fabric or same wall, if you will, to separate the different universes from being one, singular plane of existence. And the density from the supernova drops down, tearing the fabric of our universe and whatever is near it (the event horizon) simply falls down into a literal, mundane hole, (well, not really mundane since it's going to be quite bigger than most mundane holes we usually encounter, like a hole dug by a dog, but still very mundane in terms of the structure and the way it works) and goes down the hole and into, and subsequently, onto the parallel universe right under it.",astrophysics,shaababic,/r/astrophysics/comments/3qimmv/maybe_black_holes_dont_need_white_holes_which/,9

The Monogalaxy Theory,1445188287,"To my science friends,
I had a thought last night about the universe. What if the galaxies and other cosmic phenomena that we observe are reflections (like a mirage) of past iterations of our galaxy. In other words, what if there has only been one galaxy that has been born and died trillions, or zillions of times and what we are observing is the refection of that past light reflecting back at us from the edge of the universe. Is this theory plausible? 
I further pose:
Since the universe is expanding it would theoretically take quite a while before we would see ourselves as a reflection.
When we did see it (the reflection of us coming back out of the cosmos) it would be the moment of the birth of our galaxy (the sun is born) and then, if we had the camera technology available we could watch, day by day as our galaxy evolved. The only catch would be that what we are seeing would have originated from billions of years in the past and we might never realize that it was us. This assumes of course that the journey that the light takes isn't longer than the entire life cycle of our galaxy.

A question about dark matter and the Big Bang...,1443643229,"Okay, first of all: I am neither really proficient in physics (I understand how they work, but I do not understand most formulas) nor am I an english native speaker. So I will try to be as precise as possible and not making a fool of myself, ideally both at once. But let's get to the point.

As far as I know, the mass of all objects in the Milky Way would not suffice to keep them together just by gravitation. So we assume dark matter - which has its own gravitation - in addition. Then this all works.
Secondly, it seems that dark matter can be proven indirectly via the effect of gravitational lensing.

This is what brings me to my question:

When observing distant galaxies, we can see a redshift or blueshift, depending on wether they move towards us or move away.
Is there a possibility, that those galaxies might be static, but the light we observe of them is distorted by dark matter, just making it SEEM that they actually move away or towards us?

I hope I made my thoughts somewhat clear - if not, please let me know and I will answer accordingly.

Questions regarding design of sci-fi solar system,1442881744,"Hello, my friends and I have been designing a fictional solar system that has essentially been created by an insanely advanced civilization. The idea is for it to be a binary system consisting of a star and a black hole. In orbit around these stars is a super-massive terrestrial disk, which has been terraformed to allow for human life. 

I have a lot of questions about this, and I was hoping to gain some insight on what would make this kind of system possible. First off, what kind of gravitational pull would a disk like this have? Would it need to be made of some special science-fiction material in order to hold together? At what distance from the star/black hole would the width of the disk need to be in order to be habitable for humans? What kind of star would allow for human life, how would x-rays from the black hole effect life on this disk? What kind of revolution around the star/black hole would the disk need to have in order to generate day/night cycles and seasons? Would it be possible for this disks to have satellites and if so what kinds of orbits could they have? 

These are just the ones I'm coming up with immediately, but we want to really explore the details of something like this. I realize that it may be necessary to invent some science-fiction plot devices to make it possible, but we want to be as accurate as possible in designing how this system was created. We're assuming the civilization that built this has the technology required to traverse immense distances in space, manipulate whole planets/stars at a time, possibly on the edge of manipulating time. I gained a basic understanding of Kepler's laws long ago, but I'm currently getting a math major and have had a huge interest in astrophysics since I was very very young, so I can try to keep up with any formula people put forth but I'm not a physicist by any means.

(Question) mega-scale construction in space,1441194718,"This is a very complex question but I am trying to wrap my head around certain orbital mechanics.

Assume someone wants to construct a monofillament metal sheet around earth in a non-decaying orbit. The layer would deflect 100% of incoming sunlight and hence cast a shadow on the earth below.

Problem is that such sheet can not be to broad longitudinally, as it would drift towards a pure equatorial orbit. My interest in a back of the napkin calculation speculating on carrying ""towers"" that keep the reflective material suspended in large squares or hexagons, relative to the orbital equator. In other words, can massively long support beams be used to widen the reflective shielding, and if so 

1 - how wide can the reflective orbital structure be made and
2 - how much can temperatures be reduced under the solar blanket. 

I am trying to get an idea whether or not in such an elaborate contrivance an ""equatorial ice cap"" would be feasible. I suppose not (the shielding would still emit massive amounts of infrared). 

*Edit*: No tower reaches space from the ground. There is no connection between the ground and space. Nothing of this construction reaches the atmosphere. It is in orbit. Here are a few sketches of what I mean.

http://i.imgur.com/KkuQQv9.jpg

It's a sunscreen in orbit around earth. My objective is to make it as north/south (longitudinally) as wide (broad) as possible. to maximize the size of the shadow cast on the Equator. Problem is the material will drift to an equatorial orbit unless held taut by ""masts"" or ""towers"". These towers do not touch Earth's surface. They are in orbit at a 90 degrees angle north south to the equatorial plane. ",astrophysics,KhanneaSuntzu,/r/astrophysics/comments/3jchjg/question_megascale_construction_in_space/,6

What would be the best reference sources for physics equations behind star formation and stellar evolution? (see course description) **I have not taken physics before,1440718579,"Hi,

So I was wondering if of the top your heads, there is any one good place to start. I am essentially auditing a graduate level physics course after my astronomy professor who I had for 4 semesters suggested that I join. My astronomy classes were mostly conceptual and were the undergrad level. I had no idea I would love astrophysics so much because the first course I took was just a suggestion of my advisor to fulfill one of my science requirements. I am a french major, so I only am required to do 6 hours of sciences and the labs. Well, I found out how much I loved it and kept taking more until I ran out of courses to take. My professor who I had for all of these courses knew that I really loved the subject but worried as to whether I could handle the math. You see I haven't taken any math yet in college. I had been putting that off bc I didn't want to deal with it. So fast forward, I'm about to take this class where although I'm familiar with the conceptual aspect, aside from labs, I haven't dealt with equations. I know it can be hard, but I am so determined to make myself understand all of it because I really want to pursue this someday. I know if I could thrive in this class--in that I mean, be able to do the problems on my own and understand how to solve everything, I will feel so much better about the math I have to catch up on in order to get into physics in order to then go into ASTRO.  This would really boost my confidence in my ability. 

The course is called ""Stars and Stellar Evolution"" see course description:

""This course is intended to facilitate a fairly complete understanding of stars, including their structure, evolution (formation, stages of burning, end states), synthesis of elements, and the physical processes involved in each of these, as well as introduce the modern computational modeling techniques used to apply stellar physics to stars.  For astronomy students, this course will provide the background necessary to understand the underlying principles of stellar processes and modelling as they are used both in ongoing research into stellar physics and phenomena and in support of other areas of astronomical research where stellar populations, products and processes are important.  In a broader context, relevant for any physics student, this course will discuss how understanding the physical principles in fluids dynamics, high-density materials, heat transfer, plasma physics, nuclear structure, and nuclear processes are assembled into our modern understanding of how stellar objects behave, and how the study of stars pushes the frontier of understanding in these areas of physics.""

What's the first thing I should look up? I'm more concerned with equations and explanations rather than context of solar fusion. I took a class in the spring that went a lot into the conceptual aspects of this. I know that will def help my broader understanding.

Today for example we discussed the Hydrostatic Balance and wrote out the equations for Isothermal Atmosphere

I need like a source that tells me what all the letters mean in some of the equations.  so like a symbol dictionary for equations in essence. I'm searching on my own as well

On the search for ET,1437498193,"Now that Stephen Hawking is throwing support to a serious search for extraterrestrial life, I'd like to throw a major monkey wrench in the works. My personal (and somewhat expert opinion) on the matter is that the whole search method we have employed is incorrect. The search has been looking for RF carriers (very narrow-band sine waves) at interesting frequencies. I believe this is absolutely wrong. Start with a few assumptions (yeah, I know).
1. If we are looking for radiation leakage (not strictly intended for the purpose of being discovered by non-locals), then we need to be looking for modulated signals. Playing guessing games about type of modulation is going to be very difficult, so I really wouldn't want to tackle that.
2. If we are looking for evidence that a non-terran intelligence is transmitting with the express purpose of being discovered, then let's get very, very serious about it.
3. If someone wants to transmit a signal expressly for the purpose of discovery, the let's assume THEY are serious.
4. Under that assumption, the other party will spend some time and effort (which doesn't cost much) to maximize the probability of detection of their signal (and I'm going to assume the generation of the signal is expensive).
5. If we really think they're smart, and that they assume we're smart, then we're going to play an information theory game. What signal design for a given transmitter power maximizes the probability of detection under the assumption that transmitting party and receiving party are both playing this game.
6. This turns into an eigenvector problem in the signal design space, yielding a fairly broad spread-spectrum type signal. The spectral characteristics are fixed by the optimization problem, while the temporal characteristics are not.
7. Given that the temporal characteristics are not fixed, we again play a game. Given that there is no communication, what temporal characteristics will maximize the likelihood of detection? Detection is maximized by coherent averaging (+3dB over incoherent averaging), which implies that the signal must be cyclic.
8. Given a cyclic, broadband signal of known spectral characteristics, what cycle times should we seek? Here is where I do some handwaving, because there is no actual optimization problem here. I would suggest, though that there are some likely choices for the period of the signal, and I'd begin with pulsar repetition rates.

I've always been incredibly interested in astrophysics, but I've always dismissed it as a possibility because of my math scores in high school.

Supplemental project?,1435771022,"Hi guys, I made a similar post a few weeks back looking for some guidance and intuition on how to delve into the book ""An introduction to modern astrophysics.""

I just finished chapters 1-6 text and problems and find that this may be a good stopping point to reflect and solidify some of the concepts I have learned. Because I am learning and reading independently (not part of school or any program), I was looking for any insight on how to do this.

In my mind, some sort of applied research problem that could encompass a lot of the issues covered in chapters 1-6 would be ideal, but I'll need some advice on a specific topic/problem? I am also open to different ideas or suggestions. My apologies for the vagueness, but I am really just looking for a way to deepen my overall understanding of this material before moving on.

An alternative idea that I had was developing a ""mock"" presentation on one or many of these topics. There was a lot of information, so I would likely have to limit the content significantly. Verbalizing and explaining often helps me really understand concepts. I could subject my wife to sitting through my ""mock"" presentation...

For reference, the topics in chapters 1-6 include the topics seen on this table of contents:

Composition of the Solar Wind?,1435261448,"Hey everyone, first time posting in the sub.

I wanted to ask a question that I can't seem to find an answer for. As I understand, the solar wind is a combination of about 90% ionized hydrogen, 8% helium and about 2% of heavier elements. I'm curious though to find out, of the 90% that is ionized hydrogen, is there a majority one-way or the other in the distribution of protons to electrons? 

If I'm not mistaken, the cosmic rays are about 90%~ protons, so my immediate assumption is that the solar wind is mostly hydrogen protons. Still, I don't think I need to make any assumptions given the number of spacecrafts we've sent into space and through the heliosphere, particularly Voyager 1. I just can't seem to find any data from those measurements.

If anyone can, please let me know whether there is a majority of protons, electrons, or an equal distribution. And please link me to the data demonstrating this. Thank you very much!",astrophysics,BecomingTesla,/r/astrophysics/comments/3b3y8x/composition_of_the_solar_wind/,0

"Special Relativity - Bring ""Light Clock"" Hypo Full Circle",1431905619,"I am writing this after reading numerous posts online directed towards the same issue. If there is another thread addressing this, apologies. 

A hypothetical that I keep coming across when trying to understand special relativity and how it is understood to evaluate time dilation, is the ""light clock"" scenario. 

In this scenario, two light clocks are built on earth in a lab. An emission of light is shot up the light clock and when it returns back down that same clock, exactly one second has passed. One of the two light clocks is sent into space, on board a space ship traveling close to the speed of light. 

As explained in the commentary following these passages, the light clock on the space ship would take longer to tick a second than the clock on earth. The reasoning behind this time dilation is provided in relation to the ""distance"" traveled by the light emission. 

Earth light clock emission - Only has to go up and then down 
Spaceship light clock emission - Has to go up and then across and then down and across (Because it is following the movement of the ship) 

If the pilot of the speed of light spaceship were to spend a couple of days at the speed of light, he would return to earth and find that a great deal more than two days had passed on earth. 

What troubles me is how absolutely poor is this examples focus on a ""light clock."" I can honestly say I have been considering this example for a couple weeks now and still am scratching my head. I would greatly appreciate if someone could apply this same theory in a more apparent manner. It makes sense that the light would have to travel farther and that therefore will take longer, time slows down. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BODY, A NON-LIGHT RECOGNIZING WRISTWATCH?!?! 

Here is what I am thinking is the answer; The body will react the same (age slower) because at the foundational level, the principles are consistent. By that I mean, when our body ages, it is still at a molecular level similair to the light watch. When a body ages, a molecule or biological component is STILL having to MOVE in a certain direction. Because the spaceship pilot's body is moving at the speed of light, the molecular movements that his body makes which causes him to age, must move a greater distance because while moving in their respective directions, they are covering all of that distance inherent in traveling the speed of light. 

Or if the space pilot was to count out loud to himself ""One Mississippi"" ""Two Mississippi"" while traveling at the speed of light, it would still take longer for him to do so, because there is still a great deal of molecular movement going on in his body when he makes that vocalization with his mouth.

"2 questions: #1 concerning the proportional time-dilation effects of speed and gravity, and #2 concerning Hawking radiation and reference frames.",1431255853,"#1  
**Relative Relativity.**  
As an object approaches the event horizon of a Black Hole (or any gravity well, for that matter), it experiences time-dilation. As an object's speed increases in any frame, it *also* experiences time-dilation. The event horizon of an idealised black hole forms at the radius from the central point at which the acceleration due to gravity is equal to the speed of light.

My question is, how much of an in-falling object's time-dilation is due to the object's increasing speed as it falls into the hole, and how much of it is due to the curvature of the local space-time, the *strength* of the gravity field it is in?   
If the object could counter-thrust enough to hold itself up stationary against the pull of the hole (prior to hitting the event horizon), would it experience ""no"" dilation compared to the relatively flat space beyond the hole's significant influence?  
(If yes - does that mean it would have a *lower* effective event horizon? My mind is tying in knots with that one...)

----------------------------------------------------

 ^(EDIT: I'm starting to realise that the area-of-effect of *velocity*-based TD and *gravity*-based TD is different... *gravity* slows time across a *volume* of space causing anything in that volume to slow down relative to the outside universe, whereas *velocity* slows time *in* the moving object - the progress of the object doesn't slow from the viewpoint of the objective reference frame. So the outside observer watching something fall into the black hole won't see any ""deceleration"" from the object's velocity-based TD, only from the gravitational TD of the hole... have I got that right?)

-----------------------------------------------------------

#2  
**Hawking radiation.**  
As one nears an event horizon, the universe fast-forwards behind them. From the objective observer's viewpoint, far from its space-time distortion, the Black Hole shadow will shrink to nothingness over the course of quintillions of septillions of years (or whatever) - but from the faller's perspective, quintillions and septillions of years will pass in the blink of an eye as they fall towards the Event Horizon - so... is Hawking radiation (and the quantum instabilities that enable it) independent of the reference frame, or will a black hole's own time-dilation arrest the effect and extend the hole's lifespan essentially to eternity?

If it's independent - does that point to a base-level absolute ""quantum time"" that might be a solid reference frame for all of space-time? In other words: Is relativity only relative above the Quantum level?

I'm posting because I'm taking Astrophysics of Stars as an elective. To put you in context I'm finishing my geology career, and doing my thesis.
So, I came to ask for help with some problems I need to know how to solve for Friday (please please please):
1. A group of 10^5 stars, that are equal to the Sun, have a bolometric magnitude mbol1 = +5.0. What is its distance from Earth? Data: mbol(Sun) = -26.7

So I figure one has to do
mbol - M = 5Log(d) - 5

But I don't know where to obtain M (absolute magnitude). I thought maybe it was 10^5 times the absolute magnitude of the Sun, but that gives a negative distance in pc.

When we look through our telescope beyond the earth's horizon, we fail to see the mass beyond it, as we look through our best telescopes through the universe's horizon, we will never visibly detect all the hidden mass and energy that's hidden beyond the 4 dimensional horizon. I propose that all this dark energy is simply gravity from the hidden (or dark) matter beyond this 4 dimensional horizon. The detectable dark matter and dark gravity may in reality be to the 4th power beyond the universe's horizon. 

 As our planet have a fairly uniform rotational velocity and revolving velocity around the sun,  so too our universe but since it's 4 dimensional,  it's acceleration is uniform, not velocity. And I propose that the rotational acceleration of our universe is so uniform that eventually it's speed is at and beyond the speed of light. Beyond the universe's horizon,  it is timeless and going backwards in time to the point of what we would consider our universe's origin.

My particular assignment was to learn all about the data collected from the Kepler Space Telescope. What form does it come in, how is it gathered, how can we access it, what does it all mean, etc. Once this is done, along with everyone else's assignments, and it is all presented, we will begin research in the summer.

So, I ask you guys, where can I go to find this information? I know there is an FAQ that will certainly be helpful on the Kepler website. Other than this, what are some reccommended readings on the Kepler Space Telescope, its history and operation, maybe a summary of findings? How about more technical articles on the nature of the data?

I will certainly do the work I need to do on my own, I only post this in case anyone is aware of a lesser known book or source I may refer to. Also, I wanted to share my excitment :P

Recently Became Very Interested in Astrophysics,1429120352,"Hey guys, I am wondering if you wouldn't mind helping me out.

I am currently a sophomore in college, and I am a computer science and math major, both Bachelors of Science.

When I was a freshman, I wanted to do engineering, but I did not do well in Physics I and II. Partially because of the professor, but also because I had never been introduced to vectors, or any sort of physics math before.

However, I have aced all of my math classes thus far, including Calculus II and III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Discrete.

Recently I have become extremely interested in astrophysics, and some part of me feels like if I would have waited to take physics my second year, I would have done much better.

So I guess my question is, is a physics undergrad required for someone who wants to work in the field of astrophysics, is there a demand for CS majors in the field?
I just want to pursue a career in the field somehow, and am worried that the current degrees I am pursuing won't allow me to do so.

I appreciate the advise!

2) Have I simply wasted my time for 2 years? How do aerospace courses transfer to astrophysics courses? (I know this is school dependent, but in general)

String theory?,1419178615,"Astrophysicists were stumped a few years ago by a light that appeared at a certain point in our Universe, grew to a certain size and brightness before gradually fading to 'nothing'. I believe the light may have been from a 'white hole', or a massive star dying, forming a black hole from within another universe/dimension and releasing its contents into our own. This, in my comparatively small, high school-educated mind, would also explain dark matter 'clumps' surrounding galaxies. Might these gravitational 'clumps', discovered by 'gravitational lensing', possibly reflect the gravity from the gigantic collapsing star and matter that had fallen through to create the super-massive black hole at the center of the galaxy? I'm thinking the force of the collapsing star forced open one or more additional dimensions from the heretofore 'curled up' extra dimensions like a balloon. Also, I understand that gravity is the only detectable force common to all dimensions in 'string theory' and it leads me to believe that our 'Big Bang' might have been a collapsing star from another universe/dimension, or white hole. It makes sense, then, to believe that our universe is being continually 'fed' by other universes, via black hole/white holes, within the grander multi-verse and this would also, by definition, describe the accelerating expansion of our universe.

Help understanding gravitational time dilation.,1418959459,"I understand (i think) time dilation in regards to velocity. for a stationary person, someone moving close to the speed of light appears to have travelled a farther distance in the same amount of time (Using the speed of light to essentially clock your time as it remains constant regardless of perspective).  Where as the person travelling  at that speed sees the clock travelling a shorter distance in his perspective (once again using c to clock themself). Correct me if i am wrong about this or give me a better analogy so i can fully understand. 

My real question though, is, why does time appear to move slower for someone in higher gravity?

How long does such a process take? How old would the oldest and most 'blurred out' craters be?

edit: So I already have an 'it depends' reply. Of course it depends -- I should have given some kind of specific scenario, otherwise it is just too hard to give even a rough answer. The way I stated the question doesn't really account for the fact that deposition rates during the early bombardment are way different than today.

Assume the impact crater (A) happened in the asteroid belt today. How far in the past would impact crater have been 'fresh' given the image of it today underneath a lot of deposited regolith?

Just a brief theory of Supermassive Black Hole formation by way of Population III Stars,1417571036,"I'd like to see if and how much this makes sense to other people.

As the theoretical first stars of the cosmos, Population III stars were exceptionally massive (possibly hundreds of solar masses) and went through their life cycles very quickly (millions perhaps hundreds of thousands of years).

If there were extremely large quantities of these stars rapidly forming and exploding in the early universe, as a result an increasingly large quantity of stellar mass black holes would be created. If galactic and surely filamentary type structures had not yet formed in the universe from the initially uniform expanse of hydrogen gas, then Population III stars and black holes would be distributed somewhat uniformly themselves. The number of black holes would rapidly increase, and the uniformity of spatial distribution would decrease, resulting in greater numbers of black hole mergers. Once the Population III cycle was spent, the rapid stellar mass black hole formation would cease, and the huge surplus of black holes would quickly form into supermassive mass black holes (and almost no intermediate mass ones) due to positive feedback, much like planets grow exponentially from dust in stellar systems. The supermassive black holes would then go on to govern the further formation of structure in the universe.

Hydrogen gas --&gt; lots of Population III stars --&gt; lots and lots of black holes --&gt; supermassive black holes --&gt; galaxies and filaments

Given that a universe of just hydrogen gas is very different from our current state, it makes a lot of sense that odd things would happen at the beginning of its transition to a more equalized state.

A relatively okay analogy that I can think of would be how a match flares when struck before calming to a steady flame.

Grad School from the opposite end...,1416048360,"Hey Guys,

Another grad school question ( apologies ).

I am wondering how I can get into a good grad school without a physics or astronomy bachelors. I am doing a Maths/Applied Math bachelors. I do cover Fluid Mechanics, Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, PDEs, Numerical Analysis, Optimisation and Stochastic Differential Equations in my Applied Math classes.

1. Given I get some research experience, what other things could I do to increase my chances of astrophysics grad school?

2. I'm also highly interested in Machine Learning in Edinburgh University's grad school. What machine learning is used in astrophysics and would I be better off trying to get into that phd program?

3. If I want to study myself, should I start with the B.O.B or get a straight physics undergrad text?

World's Theory,1415726854,"My theory that the sun is another Earth, which I call world's theory, is based on the fact that while performing the ten plagues of Egypt, The Black Land, the sun blacked out several times. This, combined with the understanding that the spirit of the wind is in fact God himself, makes perfect sense.

I was lying in bed and meditating, and I perceived an image of bubbles consisting of planets and their atmospheres, each producing the next with motion on a planet such as ours. This was a legitimate image and not a forced thought, and therefore I would consider this superior to our current particle soup theories.

Any thoughts?

Edit: 'Worlds Theory'

To elaborate, light from the sun would be the bond between out worlds, the light would go towards a single point on the edge of the atmosphere, expand to the edges of the next planet's atmosphere, the go in, grazing the planets edges and reaching a single point on the other side, hence the cone of light from the sun.

Faith in Science? Dark matter and Dark energy?!?!,1415711986,"Something about dark matter and dark energy never sat well with me. We have, what I assume to be a bunch of math and analytics that describe our world. I'm not an astrophysicist but I've seen some scrawling of those fancy math people. The people that make those scrawlings tell me that much of their calculations rely on calculations that others have done. Ok, Newtons ""on the shoulders of giants thing"", got it. They also tell me that some of those other peoples theories are far from proven and can't really be tested. They go on to say something about needing a bigger hadron colider or there is no pratical way to test it, etc. Ok, I guess I understand, when you get into the very BIG world of things and extremes of heat and speed, those are hard to re-create.

Lets go back to the scrawlings of math type stuff. I'm not doubting that all those symbles and stuff mean something but there is a very small poplulation of people that understand it. Additionally, I have talked with deep math professors and they admit that they really understand the math type stuff that is related to their specific focus. Often times they just have to take others people math type stuff at face value because its much to complicated for them to proof out every corner of someone elses work.

Here is the catch... the extrems of our science relies on significant faith in others, sometimes dead people. It requires faith in ideas and scrawlings that are unproven and unreadable by most. I've only got the preaching of a small group of people that tell me that they have checked ""most of"" the facts behind their science. If I where to rebut this, I am often told things like ""its really complicated"". Or ""we have proof of this....(or not, sometimes you can just say you can't test that theory). Not only that but the Science community regulates it information and publication via science boards, these boards are funded by individuals with political and economic motives.

The final things that just kills me is.. to put a bow on every formula and idea presented by our modern scientific community, I must believe that MOST of our world is made up of energy and matter that can not and will not ever be identified and was ONLY discovered when its ABSENCE made their math not work.

Holly cow, that takes SO much faith. Is this Science? Why does this not feel like Science at all? I am not going to now compare science with my own spiritual beliefs because I don't think its possible to compare science and spirituality, they are two totally independent things with near zero direct correlation points. My only point here is; is Science a process that, inevitably, strongly relies on faith?

Faith in boards and people entrusted with maintaining it.
Faith in dead people that created therms that can't be proven.
Faith in energy and mater to exist when we have not way to prove it.
Faith in the word of your own pears to support your work.

Can we call this science anymore?


Edit:
Clarification - based on the lovely input I've gotten and I have really enjoyed and am grateful for the very smart people that have responded to this thread...I have to make a clarification


I am perusing the idea that ""Our Modern Scientific In query"" requires Faith. The abstraction of ""Science"" itself clearly tried to build on only facts and repeatable proofs and leave no room for Faith.


Edit 2:
Edit Notes: More Additions to build clarity around my question based on feedback and repeat comments/questions


I've had to do some updates and clarifications. I'll summarize some of that for you. You could find it spattered about this thread.

My postulate is this:

Edge modern scientific pursuits are requiring more and more faith.

-It requires some faith in the accreditation and administration of scientific record. i.e. the people responsible for the checks and balances and ensuring the integrity of some of these fringe ideas have much more room for influence from the political, social, and economic interests involved or funding them.

-It requires significant faith in theories, postulates, and formulas created by predecessors. Theories that grow increasingly in complexity, lack of testing, or ability to measure.

-It requires faith in unobserved results and measurements but rather in assumptions based on absence of a better explanation or simply adding a constant to make a formula balance (to state a few examples of faith needed in the results)


Why is this important to me? Well, time and time again I see people reference the ""irrifutability"" of scientific method in compassion to ""faith based"" religious ideals. The thing is, I see time and time again where ""faith"" in a very similar fashion is needed for the modern pursuit of science. It is my belief these are just two separate belief systems. If people want to believe Science is the end pursuit and a creator is never needed then I understand this but if your saying science is just plan better then a religious belief system because it doesn't require faith, then I have a problem.


In conclusion. The pursuit of Science as a belief system. i.e. There is no God and science will explain it all, is a belief system that does require faith to move forward. It does not maintain any specific superiority to any other belief system solely because it points to scientific method to produce proof of its belief.",astrophysics,Voltariat,/r/astrophysics/comments/2lyoed/faith_in_science_dark_matter_and_dark_energy/,75

"New cosmology, just how crazy is my professor?",1413992523,"Hello

So I am taking this seminar and this professor has been pushing his idea of new cosmology for close to  20ish years now. It's giving me a headache just listening to him, but I have no clue about astrophysics as I am a computer engineering major myself.

Basically what this guy is claiming is that stars are formed by planets which are earth size. WHAT!?

He claims

    The key to understanding how life appeared in the universe is to understand how 
    early the planets appeared and how very, very, many there are. Rather than 8 
    planets per star there are about 30,000,000. All these formed hot 300,000 years 
    after the big bang, not 300,000,000 years. Only a few came from stars. Planets 
    come from proto-galaxies, which fragmented entirely into planets at the plasma to 
    gas transition.

[Source](http://journalofcosmology.com/JOC22/GibsonSPIE2013Aug4.pdf) on Page 6.     

He claims that life did not originate on earth, but instead meteors brought life to earth, which is a bit easier to believe.

He owns the Journal of Cosmology and only publishes in there. According to him he is pretty much banned from publishing in all the popular journals that have to do with astrophysics.

www.JournalOfCosmology.com

He is also being ridiculed [here](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/03/08/i-am-getting-a-very-poor-impre/) by a biologist. 

The guy's name is Carl H. Gibson

I guess what I am asking whether there is any truth to what he is saying?

"A question about the ""hypothetical tides on Jupiter.""",1413856433,"Hello community, I am in a college course about the Solar System and this past week we have been studying tides (those of the Earth-Moon system in particular). I know that the tidal effects taking place on Earth are due to the Sun and Moon (at least these are the only tidal effects significant enough for me to take into consideration in this case), but what I am asked to discuss are hypothetical tides taking place on Jupiter compared to those here on Earth. I know that this question is meant to pick at my (and my fellow classmates') brain(s) but hopefully someone will have some input regarding my thinking.

What I suspect to be characteristic of the tides on Jupiter is that first and foremost they should be less drastic on a planetary scale (how much the ""surface"" is distorted) than here on Earth simply due to how massive it is. What I am also taking into consideration is that Jupiter has more than 60 known satellites in orbit around it, each inducing their own individual tidal effects on the gas giant thus resulting in a less symmetrical distortion in Jupiter's shape (as insignificant as said distortion my be). The last thing I am taking into consideration in my comparison is that the mean density of Earth is over four times greater than the mean density of Jupiter hence the gaseous composition of Jupiter means that it will be more malleable under tidal effects than Earth is....

Question on planetary orbit calculations.,1412777501,"Hello,

I've been working on a scale model of the solar system,  you can see it live at [https://kheckeroth.com/solarSystem].  Right now it shows the orbits for all 8 planets and Pluto.  The keplerian elements for those planets I got from (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf).  

I've been wanting to add dwarf planets into the simulation (and the positions of voyager 1 and 2, but that's a whole other challenge)  but I've ran into a minor problem.  The data I've used for the planetary positions has two components, the keplerian element and it's rate.   What I need is to figure out how the calculation for the rate is done, because that information is not provided in the keplerian elements for the Dwarf Planets [using http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi].

To clarify with an example,  in (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf) looking at the chart for Mercury it has two values for a (semi-major axis).  The first is 0.38709927 and the second is 0.00000037.  I'm trying to find out where or how the calculation was done for the second value.

Astrophysicists ;Special Relativity has been abolished -according to (Mod ) u/iorgfeflkd(expertise ;relativity et al).Can you explain?,1412702370,"
In response to the question

,'A spaceship accelerated to near-c speed should collapse to a singularity form because its mass increases and its length decreases(so density rises)so - is special relativity maintained here? 

, 'u/robustetceleritas amd Mod iorgkfeld(listed expertise;relativity et al)agreed that

#mass-increase was a discarded mathematical 'trick',

#Anyway a reference frame could always be arbitrarily found to nullify any effect of SR ,so we simply find such and this super-density disappears too,

Apart from so many things which are *wrong* with this reply ,we wish to point out the most pertinent;

*The twins-paradox ,or the castor and pollux paradox-,Those familiar with the antecedents of SR would recall this famous counterexample, whose proponents pointed out that if SR was true then two identical twins castor and pollux(greek twin semi-deities,fyi) ,separated by a spaceship journey where castor remains at rest and pollux flies at a near-c for awhile ,would, by the SR prediction of time-dilatation, have the traveler- twin age while the other remains young.The textbooks explanation was that the traveler had undergone a different experience from the other at rest ,having accelerated,so the effects were correct,and this were severally confirmed,especially in the much-cited muon mountaintop to sea-level .However *none ever claimed a suitable reference frame could simply be found to nullify it and each affirmed the ageing effect .So why the apparent retreat ?If other were tested and why this retreat?Shouldn't this prediction ,unforeseen though it was(till general relativity) also be tested?

*Also Einstein's own coauthored text on SR affirms this and our(American- published) textbooks in singing the praises of SR point out,(rightly)that its predictions were subjected to stringent tests- and found to be true.And this without needing the help of finding 'an arbitrary reference frame', which should render SR an academic nullity (as any of its predictions would in any case reduce to the classical if we arbitrarily choose a @rest reference frame for any of our tests)

btw(for robustetceleritas and Mod);mathematicians here completely repudiate your description of anything as a ""mathematical trick"" and demand you change this forthwith to a 'physics trick' unless you prefer business with pistols at dawn,at a place of your choosing....

10th Dimension Clarification,1409748178,"So I've just started taking a more active approach to Astrophysics and wondered if there were people on here who could discuss things and clarify certain theories I've been reading about, I'm not science illiterate but I'll confess I'm no Stephen Hawkins either.

Having recently read some of the works of NDT it lead me to read and watch some stuff relating to dimensions and the theories related to them. 

The first question I have regards the so called ""10th Dimension"", the ultimate of our dimensional awareness, as i understand it the 10th Dimension is the embodiment of every possible dimension including the crossing over of infinite dimensions with other infinite dimensions. Therefore you can't have more than 10 dimensions because theoretically 10thDimA would already include 10thDimB (that's how I've understood it, could be entirely wrong). But i was wondering, could the 10th Dimension infact be light? I imagine many learned astrophysicist just did a huge collective facepalm for which i apologise.

Obviously light travels through photons and if light is ever-present therefore surely photons must be too. Everything from a 1 dimensional point to a 3 dimensional object requires the presence of photons and light for it to be seen. And since time (4th Dimension) is also affected by light, does that mean that everything 5th Dimension upwards (3d objects existing in 4d ""areas of spacetime"" with alternative 5^D possible paths) also would use light + photons as their ""constant of existance"", the ever-present constant in every dimension (""the tenth dimension"")?

Furthermore at the event horizon of black holes, while many have theorized that because everything reaches the speed of light due to gravitational extremities we cannot perceive there to be anything existing. What if the density is so great that upon the destruction of the photons (loss of electromagnetic charge, destruction of protons etc) light can no longer travel and therefore if it was the ""10th dimensional fabric"" that all things exist upon, and it itself ceased to exist, that would explain the absence of anything past the event horizon? 

I imagine to most people I sound like an idiot spouting newly learnt words out of my face like a water fountain, they would of course be entirely correct but we all have to start somewhere!",astrophysics,deano1deano,/r/astrophysics/comments/2fcoaq/10th_dimension_clarification/,5

The theory: We're a 4 dimensional projection on a 5 dimensional universe. Have I got this right?,1409696065,"I've heard this before, and on trying to explain some stuff to my in-laws, I think I came up with how this all works.

Taking a 4 dimensional universe, like ours. Relativity says that traveling at the speed of light means that the passage of time stops (relative to everything else).

If you look at a black hole in our universe, there's a point at which light can no longer escape. That would basically mean that gravity is pulling so strong that it is accelerating matter/energy at the speed of light towards the singularity at the center. That event horizon becomes the mathematical spherical surface wherein time can no longer move.

To a certain extent, if time isn't moving, you can pretty much throw it away as a dimension of time/space. An event horizon becomes a way to smash a 4 dimensional universe into a 3 dimensional one.

Move that same black hole into a 5 dimensional universe, with the dimensions of length, width, height, time, and for lack of a better name, spaghetti. Time is just another axis of motion in the 5 dimensional universe is the same as length, width, or height is for us. Spaghetti is the 5 dimensional equivalent of time, and spaghetti is the dimension that gets flattened, smeared out over the surface of event horizon of that 5 dimensional black hole.

Our universe's expansion can also be explained by this theory; the 5 dimensional black hole continues to consume 5 dimensional matter and, as such, the event horizon is expanding.

Discussing whether our universe is inside a black hole,1407304022,"Hi guys,

I have started putting together a philosophical paper looking at the theory that our universe exists inside a black hole within another universe, and consequently that all black holes may contain universes.
This paper is entirely opinion based, but was originally intended to be more research based, so there may be some inconsistencies in this draft.

I was hoping if anyone was curious, if they could give it a read through and let me know if I have anything critically incorrect about anything I might state as a more solid theory, and was also looking to have a discussion on this theory in general.

This is entirely a personal project of mine.

"Could ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"" and black holes be connected in a simple way?",1406578939,"There have been thoughts floating around in my mind a long time about dark matter, dark energy and black holes and how they could be connected somehow.

First, my layman understanding of these phenomenon:

* *Dark matter* is a theorized term, describing the unaccounted mass that is to be expected from galaxies. In other words, the amount of mass in a galaxy does not compute with the gravitational pull inside nor the outward influence on other galaxies or light.

* *Dark energy* is also a theorized term, describing the unaccounted force that is needed for there to be the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. In other words, there is not enough energy from the ""Big Bang"" to account for the acceleration in the expansion of the universe.

* *Black holes* are observable and are an extremely dense point that is so heavy, and therefore has so much gravitational pull, that it sucks in matter.

If these descriptions are correct, but please correct me if I'm wrong, I first have a couple of questions, and then a theory:

* Where does the matter that gets sucked into a black hole go? I've seen the enormous ""plumes"" that shoot out of them on pictures/simulations, but do they contain only gasses, like I had understood, or do they account for the amount of mass that is sucked in, in other words, does matter ""disappear"" into a black hole?

* Does dark matter only ""occur"" in galaxies, in other words, does dark matter ""need"" a black hole?

If both are answered with a ""yes"":

What if the matter that gets sucked up in all black holes around the universe, somehow, lands at the *outside*, the *edge* of the universe? What if that matter then accounts for the ""dark energy"", instead of an inside push, an outside pull?

What if the gravitational pull of the black holes in the centers of galaxies is ""underestimated"". What if only counting the stars and their mass is not enough? What if some extra pull from the black hole in the center could account for ""dark matter""?

Am I thinking too simple, am I ignorant, stupid, please explain.

From where does space come?,1406004994,"I have a question: From where does space come? I mean, if the universe is everything by definition, but keeps expanding, the new space must come from somewhere and I have no idea from where. 

Can vacuum be created from existing vacuum? If so, why is it that when vacuum exerts a contractive force on what's around it and more vacuum exerts more force, that the energy required to keep the universe from collapsing does not increase?

I get that there's something called dark or exotic matter and we don't really know squat about it. However, even if there is some property of exotic matter that keeps the universe from collapsing (or even causes expanding), there must be more of that matter the larger the universe grows to keep up with the expanding force of the vacuum.

Black hole and singularity really infinitely small?,1405638650,"It's always been said that the matter would condense inside the black hole into almost infinite. How can that be if the speed limit is thus dictated itself determined by the mass, just as is the case with the terrestrial escape velocity? It's now so no mass in his property known to us and composition can cross a black hole, it dissolves as mass because it has completely transformed into energy.

In addition, a further compression would in any case not be possible if she would not injure those between law maxim Alster energy and minimal size. If they could further condense the existing energy potential would be far greater than mc^2 . But a further compression in the direction of infinity would produce an infinitely high energy. And this is not possible.

I have a flaw?

mc^2 = Gm1m2 / a1 like a consistent manner mc^2 = Gm1 / a1.

Accordingly, if a mass should have compressed to the size of a black hole, as is commonly said, then go from that object has a gravitational force equal to c^4 / G (Planck energy) with a corresponding maximum radiated power of c^5 / G (Planck power) from. And this is essential because those marginal power is gone the same size on all sides. That is, within the black hole effect the same outward force, as it acts to SR from the outside inwards. The mass can never be more compact, simply because it is no more mass = that is a maximum of the so-called event horizon in the region between 2Gm / c^2 at least Gm / c^2 . This front is called the event horizon, not without reason, because the singularity takes place there not inside the black hole. So not within the boundary of Gm / c^2 ?

Black hole and singularity really infinitely small?,1405637857,"It's always been said that the matter would condense inside the black hole into almost infinite. How can that be if the speed limit is thus dictated itself determined by the mass, just as is the case with the terrestrial escape velocity? It's now so no mass in his property known to us and composition can cross a black hole, it dissolves as mass because it has completely transformed into energy.

In addition, a further compression would in any case not be possible if she would not injure those between law maxim Alster energy and minimal size. If they could further condense the existing energy potential would be far greater than mc2 . But a further compression in the direction of infinity would produce an infinitely high energy.

I have a flaw?

mc2 = Gm1m2 / a1 like a consistent manner mc2 = Gm1 / a1.

Accordingly, if a mass should have compressed to the size of a black hole, as is commonly said, then go from that object has a gravitational force equal to c4 / G (Planck energy) with a corresponding maximum radiated power of c5 / G (Planck power) from. And this is essential because those marginal power is gone the same size on all sides. That is, within the black hole effect the same outward force, as it acts to SR from the outside inwards. The mass can never be more compact, simply because it is no more mass = that is a maximum of the so-called event horizon in the region between 2Gm / c2 at least Gm / c2 . This front is called the event horizon, not without reason, because the singularity takes place there not inside the black hole. So not within the boundary of Gm / c2 ?

Simple (perhaps) Question about Astronomical Distance and Light,1404551417,"I was researching some cosmological units and became interested in the radius of the observable universe. I had assumed this to be 13.7 billion light years, or the age of the universe since the big bang. I was educated on the fact that to due to universal expansion, the radius of the observable universe is now around 46.6 billion light years. But I thought then..., the photons from that point in time would be from when the universe was largely all hydrogen and helium composed white hot plasma. So then I started to think of stars... I know some stars are old... almost as old as they universe. I found that recently discovered SMS0313 is around 13.6 billion years old...only 100000000 (.1B) years from the age of the universe itself. SMS0313 happens to be around only 6000 lightyears from earth. If the star (SMS0313) is 13.6 billion years old, how is it that it is 6000 light years away. Yet if I think of another star, (I will use one of my fave stars), Vega...Vega is only 850mill yo and 25 light years away, and yet Gliese 581 which has been in the news so much due to Kepler, is 22.02 ly away, and about the same age as our own sun, 5bill yo. I sort've realize this question may not be sound because a stars formation doesn't depend on how far it is... and they are independent variables. But can someone explain these data a bit more for me? Also if you happen to know... Can you sum up cosmological expansion... there should constant for it, right? Perhaps some distance over some time or something.... Thanks, would appreciate it!

How do you compute unit vector toward the Sun represented in Earth-Centered Inertial frame (ECI)?,1404275870,"Hello,
I'm writing a MATLAB program for computing the unit vector to the sun in the Earth-centered inertial frame, given the Julian Date.

I would like to check with another source to confirm whether the computations generated from my code are correct, but the closest source I've found is the JPL HORIZONS Web-Interface, here:

Music School Student Switching to Astrophysics,1404231969,"I'm currently/was at Berklee College of Music studying film scoring and jazz composition.. thing was I had to take a semester off, and during that semester off, I taught music lessons privately, was hired as a full time sub teaching music, and I played many many gigs all around home region. I think the semester off was productive as it gave me experience in my field, but it sort of made me realize I love music, but don't have a passion for teaching it..

I love love playing my gigs, but the work is feast or famine, and honestly, the lifestyle was starting to get to me (really late nights, unruly crowds, arguing with owners trying to screw you with pay, and drinking in bars)

Music has always been a passion, but so has astrophysics. I chose music because though because I thought I'd love to teach it, but I don't.. I love playing it..

So I'm thinking about returning to school to pursuit astrophysics, but I'm unsure if the major would be right with me, as I've been two-three years removed from math classes. I'm willing to put in the work, and I know there will be late nights as well, but not that it seems ""less stressful"", the work seems more beautiful. I'm honestly just tired of the music scene, I've been playing for five years now. 

Space has been a hobby since I was a little kid, and I'm an amateur ""star gazer"", so I've always had a fascination

QUESTION 

What are some things I can expect majoring in astrophysics? how are the classes? do you think someone like me can do this or is it too late? are there any quality AFFORDABLE (big reason I dropped out of Berklee was money) universities to study in the states?

Black hole thought I can't figure out...,1404174459,"I've thought about this for a while and don't know the answer, maybe somebody can help.

If that happens though, why isn't that information still on all black holes from everything that's fallen into then from the beginning, and that we can still see this information? Is it that if one isn't actually constantly observing the item, then there is no information left and no information to transmit to a later observer? Hopefully my question made some sense.",astrophysics,[deleted],/r/astrophysics/comments/29irbr/black_hole_thought_i_cant_figure_out/,11
Black Hole gravity question,1404148687,"The smallest black hole that can form in nature is about 4 solar masses. I know that the sun's surface gravity is about 25 G. I know that the sun is about half a million kilometers big, give or take. So lets simplify. Let's assume that a certain ""fairly small"" black hole has a 100G gravity of one 100 at 500.000 kilometers. 

That would mean that at twice that distance, G pulling on anything i orbit would be half that, or about 50 G. Let's continue this

* one million kilometers // 50 G
* two million kilometers // 25 G
* four million kilometers // ~12 G
* eight million kilometers // 6 G
* 16 million kilometers // 3 G
* 32 million kilometers // 1,5 G
* 65 million kilometers - slightly under one G.

So, simplifying, at about 50 million kilometers (about the distance from the sun to Mercury) distance from an object (which happens to be the smallest type of black hole that naturally forms) the gravitational pull is as strong as exerted by the Earth.

Note, that same object exerting a G pull (make sure you have powerful engines or you will be stuck there) will be about the size of your hometown - i.e. several kilometers. There would be no visible black hole, even with a very powerful telescope. You might with a telescope mounted on a space craft orbiting at 50 million kilometers be able to see some minor light distorting, but *nothing* we can ever engineer will be able to get anywhere near this spot at anything under many millions of kilometers. 

Question - if the sun would be in a decaying orbit around the above 4 solar mass black hole, how long would it take before the black hole had completely eaten the sun? How big would the inner and outer regions of the accretion disk become? Tens of millions of kilometers? Millions of kilometers? hundreds of thousands of kilometers? I am having trouble parsing the scales involved here. 

Mercury orbits the sun in something like 225 days. In the above example an equivalent planet at a similar distance would move a little faster, let's round up to about 64 days. Let's infer from that.

* 25 million kilometers - 32 days
* 12 million kilometers - 16 days
* 6 million kilometers - 8 days
* 3 million kilometers - 4 days
* 1 million kilometers - slightly over a day
* 500.000 kilometers - about 12 hours
* 250.000 kilometers - about 6 hours
* 125.000 kilometers - about 3 hours 

Am I still seeing this vaguely approximately correct here? When does an equivalent mercury start ripping to shreds based on tides in the above example?

Time in the fourth physical dimension.,1404109696,"I may need to go to the Explain It Like I'm Five.  

I have seen time explained in terms of light movement, and that makes the most sense to me.  I was playing around with little diagrams of lightwaves in different dimensional space (assuming that waves move in the same manner as we perceive them).  Assuming that the wavelength was consistent, a first-dimension would be either permanent light or permanent darkness.  Light and dark would exist as unchanging points going ""left"" or ""right"".  

I may be unclear on the basic concept of ""space-time"", but my current understanding is that you can give 4D coordinates one of two ways.  You can say I'll meet you on the corner of 10th street and 12th avenue, on the 5th floor at 2 PM.  Or you can give coordinates in a tesseract.  

Light moves in waves through our three-dimensional space in directional waves.  Has any sort of theoretical work been done on how it moves through fourth dimensional (vacuum) space?

"Became interested in astrophysics through TV show Stargate SG-1, would like to learn more about the field, its opportunities, and the available paths to get there",1402803956,"Hi everyone. I'm going into my sophomore year of high school and recently started to explore career options. I've found myself interested in physics-based fields and I can hold my own in math. Last year I took honors physics, this coming year I will be taking AP physics and honors chemistry in addition to calculus. So far I've looked into careers in statistics, engineering, and, most recently, physics. I realize the notion of gathering career inspiration from a television show may come off as laughable, but please hear me out. 

Those of you who have seen the show will recall Amanda Tapping's character, Samantha Carter, who is a theoretical astrophysicist that serves in the air force and is ""the foremost expert on wormhole travel."" Carter's scientific ramblings often baffle other characters, but I am continually enraptured and intrigued with what I can understand. 

Do astrophysicists actually study such areas as the possibilities of wormholes, the nature of black holes, and the mysteries of time? These sort of topics interest me to no end. Obviously, working for a military-operated, top secret organization that deals with travel through space and time isn't the end goal here. But I like to think that being paid to discover details in topics at least covered in Stargate would be a phenomenal occupation.

I realize that the field typically requires a Phd to delve into the truly fascinating opportunities (meaning multiple years of school), but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. For now, I'd greatly appreciate the chance to learn from all of you about what astrophysics truly entails, the paths you can traverse with an astrophysical background, and how satisfying astrophysics is (for those of you who are in the field or have been in the past).

It's a question of economics. All currencies on Earth are based on the value of gold. Not many citizens know that but gold is an extraterrestrial metal coming from the death of a star. When a star is dying, its mass is growing, atoms are compressed and when the star explodes, it spreads large amounts of gold in young solar systems. That's why gold is not a mineral to treat but a perfect, carbon free metal. This means that it is the most common substance in the universe, no more value than a piece of plastic.""

Of course I would need this to be simplified.

Ive been reading wikipedia. Is the following correct, thinking of a simplified creation?

* big bang ejects a certain amount of mass outwards at a set velocity
* as the mass is vectoring outwards gravitational forces draw it together into ""clumps""
* at a set clump size, the mass ignites forming a star

This is where I lose it. At this point, I would have a bunch of stars randomly distributed with mass scattered in the middle. This mass would be in clumps nearing ignition. Most likely, when I factor in the growing gravitation of the stars I would have heaps of binary+ systems.

But what about the planets. I read that they are most likely formed from hheavier material ejected from the star. But when does this ejection take place. And whatabout gas giants?

I had an idea. Slightly after the big bang, elementary particles started to form. As I understand it, you can't have two particles of the same state at the same position and time. That would mean the universe would get into an illegal state. A solution to this would be to distribute the particles over a bigger volume. Such an expansion could not be limited by speed of light if overlaps shall be avoided at all time.

This would still lead to a situation with the speed of light being exceeded. But whenever there is a contradiction between the theories of relativity and quantum physics, the latter always seem to win.

Hey Mr Gross,

I'm sending you this message because I'm a little stuck in terms of deciding on a degree/career path and was hoping that you could give me some insight. Basically, I have an interest in physics/astronomy and had originally planned to get a degree in that field, go into a post-grad program and go into research of some kind. After completing some of the first year courses for that degree as well as a few other potential majors (I've done about three years of jumping back and fourth between arts and science at this point), I realized that while I am very interested in the field I would rather not be in school and living at home until I'm 30. That being said, I've started to look into career options for someone with a physics BSc, so that I could get out into the working world and then go back to school some years down the road when I'm older to potentially get a Masters and/or PhD. It seems as if there's not a ton of jobs specifically for physics majors with only a bachelors degree, but I was considering potentially looking into teaching high school physics/math for a bit. More than anything I was just hoping you could give me some insight as far as what the job market is like for these positions, or some other potential careers that would be relevant to that degree since you've probably been in a similar position to the one I'm in now. I'm also not 100% clear on what other schooling I would need besides my bachelors degree if I were to teach at a high school. Any advice you could give me would be much appreciated as I'm feeling a little lost at the moment. I'm not sure if I'm seeking this degree for the wrong reasons since I would be pursuing it more out of interest than the job opportunities it provides.

Is Astrophysics a good path for me?,1398879032,"Let me start off by giving some background information about me:
I'm currently 16 years old, in 5th year (Irish school system, it's the year before the GCSE's for the British reading).

However, my math is very bad. The current physics course in my school seems to deal with very basic maths nothing too complicated for me, however during this year I've slipped very far behind in mathematics. Mainly due to depression/anxiety and thus missing class.

I honestly have reached a point where I simply cannot see myself enjoying anything but astronomy/astrophysics with my life. I see no point to life other than to gain a greater understanding as to why everything is how it is and how it all came to be.

Interested in Developing a Hypothetical Solar System,1398728956,"Hello, /r/astrophysics! 

I am currently in the process of developing the groundwork for a science-fiction novel.  The novel is going to be set in a fictional solar system, but I want to stay true to astrophysics.  I'm trying to stay closer to the hard end of the scifi scale: no FTL travel, teleportation, or anything like that.  If the novel ever gets off the ground and people read it, I want them to be impressed by how much effort and work went into modelling the world of the novel.  

I would really like to create a thorough model of the fictional system.  I hope to have something like 15-20 planets in the system (is this even possible?).  I want to have their masses and sizes known, along with the mass, size, and type of star at the center.  Using these facts, I could calculate the orbital properties of the bodies, including the lengths of a day and a year for each planet.

My ultimate goal would be to develop a diurnal and annual clock for each planet which would allow me to track the location of each planet right from the start of the novel's events.  This way I would always know exactly where each planet was at any point along the novel's timeline, as well as what time of day it was and what time of the year it was on each planet.

So, my basic questions are: are there any easily obtained simulators that would allow me to go about this in this much detail? Would I mostly have to work it all out by myself? How would I even start with that? What are the sorts of things that astrophysicists or astronomers would look for to determine whether the fictional system is realistic or not?

Any help in answering any of these questions would be very appreciated.  Thank you!

"I want a PhD in Astrophysics. The problem is, my BA is in Business. Help?",1397697322,"I graduated university back in 2006. I loved studying business and thought it was my life calling. I still like business, but as with most 22 year olds, I didn't really know what I wanted out of life at that young of an age.

I want to be part of team that is contributing to the scientific community and trying to discover or learn something new. 

I've looked at a few ways of going back to school. But for the most part, it looks like I'd have to start undergrad all over again, since I don't have the right science credits to pick up with an MA. At 30, with a family to support, the idea of starting all over again, and spending 8 years or more before getting a PhD is depressing. 

I've looked at Swinburn University. I can get in their Astronomy online MA program. However, it's course work and not research. I don't know if any reputable PhD program back here in the States would take me on. And I don't know how an Astronomy MA would affect any research jobs down the road. 

I'm at a real loss here. I don't know what to do. Some people find what they love early in life. Some people, that love changes over time. Why I came to this so late, I don't know. But I want to make up for lost time the fastest way possible.

Question on the formation of planetary systems,1397670981,"So as I understand it:

1.  Cloud of gas collapses in on itself due to gravity, forming a star.

2. Matter settles in a disc around star.

3. Matter orbiting star begins to condense, form planets and larger objects.

4. Objects eventually become planets, tadaa, you have a planetary system.

So my question is regarding the step 2.  Why does matter orbit the star in a flat disc?  Why can't matter orbit the star from a multitude of directions?  Is it simply that over time, the matter collides and knocks out or swallows up matter that it happens to collide with, eventually leaving no objects in stray orbits?  If special relativity states that gravity causes a bend in the fabric of spacetime, why doesn't all matter appear on a single plane, just as the planets orbiting star seem to do?  For matter to exist as it does, spacetime would have to exist in a 3 dimensional plane, which I can't easily visualize.

Edit: I can't figure out how to word this correctly, but just know that I'm not saying exactly what I intend to when I talk about spacetime existing in a 3 dimensional plane.",astrophysics,[deleted],/r/astrophysics/comments/2375og/question_on_the_formation_of_planetary_systems/,1

If travelling close to the speed of light affects the speed of time passing...,1397317469,"Ok. Bear with me, I'm kinda stupid. 

I feel like i've read or seen somewhere that if somebody was to travel far enough away at a high enough speed, that when they came back, they would be a different age than the people on earth who hadn't left.

Now... our planet is moving at a certain speed. We are moving around the sun, and the sun is moving around the galaxy, and the galaxy is moving around the universe. So we have the speed of our rotation around the sun, plus/minus the speed of the sun rotating around the galaxy, plus/minus the galaxy moving around the universe. So... there is that speed, compared to whatever ""stationary"" can be considered. 

Now, say another planet had life on it, but their planet was moving either much faster, or much slower... as I was laying in bed last night, it blew my mind considering what impact that may have on the development of life elsewhere in the universe.

A question on switching careers to astrophysics,1397047501,"Hello everyone,

I'm hoping to harness your collective wisdom on a pressing question. So I'm an Egyptian journalist based in Beirut, where I cover security issues and the fallout from the Syrian crisis, and I'm an engineering graduate (2009). I had always wanted to study astrophysics since childhood, inspired by the writings of Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman. But unfortunately I did not have the option of studying that in college in the Middle East and so I studied electrical engineering and journalism. I ended up working in the latter because of the dry and unimaginative manner in which we are often taught science here.

I would really love to switch careers to the astrophysics field, which I am passionate about. I earned my BSc in electrical engineering back in 2009 and have worked in journalism since then. 

My question to the awesome folks here is this: what sort of educational path should I take? My understanding is that most US graduate programs for astrophysics are PhDs, and very few actually offer an MSc in astrophysics. I feel like I would need to do at least a master's program to bridge the gap resulting from the fact that my BSc is in engineering and the fact that I did not work in the field since I graduated 5 years ago.

Would love any advice! Cheers Reddit.",astrophysics,meerakulous,/r/astrophysics/comments/22lpee/a_question_on_switching_careers_to_astrophysics/,9

I'm about to start an astrophysics major (just finished general ed) and need some encouragement.,1396894257,"Here is the reason why I need encouragement.

Math. 
I am now 23 years old, have been indecisive and stuck at a community college for four years now, and have finally decided this is what I want to do. Unfortunately, all of my life I have struggled with math, and it wasn't until a recent semester when I was in PreCalculus (algebra) that I realized two things about myself. 1. I can pass a math class with an A (this was the first time 11 years that I had made an A in math) 2. I have a math disability that is called Dyscalculia. I am not on the extreme side of Dyscalculia, but it is what gives me problems. ([information on dyscalculia)] (http://www.ncld.org/types-learning-disabilities/dyscalculia/what-is-dyscalculia)

I have come to the realization that I can do this after making my first A in math in a very long time, but that feat went unrecognized by my family, friends, pretty much everyone except that prof. (Literally my mother's response was: your teacher was just being nice.) I really truly want to make this something I study and becomes a career, but I would like to know if others out there also have gone through this with math disorders, and how the dealt with it, as well as any encouragement you lovely people can throw at me.

tl;dr I have a slight learning disability in math and would like encouragement for studying astrophysics where I have never had any before.  ",astrophysics,artandpirates,/r/astrophysics/comments/22fzzz/im_about_to_start_an_astrophysics_major_just/,7

"[ask astrophysics] Could the speed of light be more like the sound barrier, therefore possible that dark matter is FTL, and possible cause of Big Bang?",1396887754,"Edit: After perusing through this subreddit, I should add to the title, ""What am I missing?"" I do know that I'm either horrifically wrong, or someone else probably had this idea. Please don't kill me with your secret astro-weapons :p

Hi, new person here. This is more an exercise in humility to see if I'm just coming up with crazy hypothesis' that have already been tested, since I'm neither smart or knowledgeable enough to do it myself. So if these have already been tested I would love a link or a place where I can read about it. Also, if this belongs more in r/askscience, let me know.

tl;dr Could photons of light be causing a barrier like air molecules create the ""sound barrier?"" Which in turn could mean a lot of new ideas?

This idea stems from watching the Cosmos last night, so forgive the armchair astrophysics, I do genuinely want to learn about this.

Light is made out of photons (I think, but essentially some particle)
Could the reason why whenever an attempt has been made to make something go FTL, that it becomes more massive, be due to the particles of visible and invisible light (naked eye standpoint) essentially crowding around the leading edge of the thing, creating massive resistance on the particle? Like air compresses around the nose of a plane just before it goes super sonic?

If something could go FTL (let's take the constant aspect out of this), would it then be fast enough to ""beat"" whatever light that could reflect off of it, if at all, essentially ""blocking"" it's own light, rendering it invisible?

If that's the case, could that be what we ""see"" when we observe dark matter? Just something that is going faster than it's own light?

If all that is the case, or is possible at least, to go faster than light would require a tremendous amount of energy. Could that be what the Big Bang is? Essentially the ""sonic boom"" of something going faster than light, in turn throwing off particles that are faster than light, while also particles that are not cable of breaking that constant?

If I'm not understanding some aspect that makes this all not make sense, please educate me. I just thought this was an interesting thought while having coffee this morning, and would like to see if anyone has ever had the same idea, honestly.

I guess what I'm really trying to say is, I have no idea how light works, but would like to. At least in a more detailed sense

A thought experiment on the relation of black holes and the big bang.,1396568783,"*Just a complete disclaimer, I only know enough astrophysics and cosmology to know I have no clue. Though wide read,  it has been years since I studied a theory. And I am in fact just an engineer. So for all I know, this idea can be common, completely stupid, repeatedly questioned and what not. And for all I know, I might even be posting this in the wrong place*


**Here it goes.**


I've did at thought experiment, and have since scouted the internet in search of any articles on the subject. But I have failed to find any. And I'd really appreciate if you could take time to read through this and help me settle my mind on the subject.

I looked at a couple of ideas:

* What enters a black hole might travel through spacetime and emerge at any point in spacetime.
* The information paradoxes suggested by Stephen Hawking
* We do not know if what lies beyond the event horizon of a black hole is governed by the same physical rules as our universe.

So I started to think, if the mass that goes into a black hole gets ""flattened"" or uniformed - killing off physical information, like hawking suggested. And these particles (being elementary particles or waves) could in theory be ""ejected"" into any point in spacetime. Could this be extruded at the big bang? Pretty much as a white hole.

Would the idea suggest that the same energy can exist multiple times in the universe? Would that suggest that energy is growing, or endlessly large?

I understand completely I could be just being silly here, but I'd love if someone could point me in the direction of some literature or theories that could settle my mind on this, rather than point me towards the door out of here. Or point out if I have missed something, and am just being silly.

"A different way to view, explore, and label existence: Magnification Patterns or ""MP's""",1396257067,"If:

1)  If the ""stuff"" of existence, in theory, can be infinitely large and infinitely small.  

2)  If one had the ability to zoom in at the ""stuff"" of existence at a continuous, unlimited rate to see smaller and smaller things, with no limit.

3)  Likewise, if one had the ability to zoom out at the ""stuff"" of existence at a continuous, unlimited rate to see larger and larger things, with no limit.

Then:  

We would, in my opinion, theoretically observe an infinitely reoccuring pattern.

Thus:

1)  We would need to come up with a term for this pattern if there isn't one already. I would call it maybe, ""magnification patterns"" or ""MP's"".

2)  We could begin a numerically systematic way of labeling these MP's, such as ours being labeled as, ""MP 0"", and then the next smallest one being labeled a smaller number such as, ""MP -1"", then ""MP -2"",  and so on.  

Likewise, the larger MP's would go in a positive number such as the next largest being called, ""MP 1"", then ""MP 2"" and so on.

3)  We could likely make decent predictions as to the specific properties of these other MP's.  

Reason being, the same scientific laws and components that govern our MP would theoretically make up and govern the others.

This would, of course, greatly improve our ability to scientifically understand and manipulate all levels of existence.

I hope I explained myself well enough.

"I asked a question and got down voted to death. PLEASE, instead of punishing me, could someone with civility explain the flaws in my postulation.",1395409179,"
First let me say thank you for coming this far!
So here we go!

If the fabric of time and space are one, and matter and energy are equivalent, then why wouldn't all matter throughout ""all"" time, past present AND future be inescapably attracted to the hyper energy dense singularity during those first seconds that the cosmos came Into being?

I feel the way gravity is currently portrayed in its method of action goes a long way towards the general lack of understanding about what makes it tick.

""As I understand it"", gravity only effects spacial geometry, it has absolutely and utterly 'zero' direct effect on physical matter itself. What we observe is merely an optical illusion, an observed optical distortion of spacial geometry. 

 As an example of this, would not a spiral galaxy be in reality shaped more like a starfish if you accounted for the frame dragging occurring at its arms via its dense galactic center?
Would this not also explain the unexplained high rate of speed at which these arms move in direct contradiction to their distance to their galaxies central mass?

If Einstein is to be believed, and I believe many of us do, wouldn't any other perspective of gravity be false?

If time and space are one, and mass and energy are equivalent, that can only mean that sufficient energies would exhibit gravity equally as well.

Ergo:
That would imply that all of gravities observable effects are but a relic of the initial singularities ultimate and all encompassing energy density, would it not?
 NOTHING, has, does, or ever will possess the energy/density/mass/ and subsequent gravitationally induced spacial distortion of that singular point in time and space that was what we call the singularity.
(Time and space are still one right?)

Would it not be possible to prove this perspective if we could observe a lessening of gravities effects in relation to its observed visual effect on matter the further away timewise we move from that first initial point in time? 
And would this not allow for an increasingly expanding universe without the need for dark matter?

Please, help me! Don't berate me. I'm not ignorant. I have a inner city public education in one of America's worst cities

What should I consider when choosing a PHD project?,1394048285,"This is directed to you anonymous academic astrophysicists out there...

I am currently touring prospective graduate programs in astrophysics. I am interested in analytical and numerical modeling, and I have several options for both thesis advisers and projects ranging from high-energy accretion/jets to stellar/solar physics across several programs.

Besides considering things like fit, funding, and adviser advocacy, I am wondering what other things I should be considering and asking while choosing a thesis group/project that will give me a competitive edge in the post PHD market. 

I realize I will not be choosing my thesis topic my first year, but these are things I want to start thinking about now before I even decide which program to attend. Of course this solicitation for advice is not instead of speaking with my current undergrad adviser, I just want a broader sample of experience-based advice.

Conversion from apparent magnitude to absolute magnitude.,1393977401,"Hey guys

I'm having a problem converting a crazy load of stars from Yale Bright Star Catalog changing the apparent magnitudes to absolute magnitudes. Then plotting them.


The problem is that i can only do one at a time. I need to convert maybe around 150-200 stars. How can i do this? I have don't have the distance but i have the parallax which i can use to get the distance.

Here is the relation M = m - 5log10(d) + 5   

I can do it on paper 1 at a time, but the problem lies in the doing all 200 of them, but this would take an insane amount of time. How can i scale this up?

"Can someone help me with this lab question? It's about interstellar reddening with star clusters, but a bit more involved than that.",1393055311,"Hi, 

So I'm requesting help again. I'll post the lab discussion question and background info + my response thus far. I understand most of it, I just need to find the right facts to support my claim, here goes:


**context: lab about finding the distance to Pleiades star Cluster by plotting absolute magnitude vs apparent on two graphs--one  for apparent, one for absolute. Then we overlaid them (one was transparent) and compared the shift).**


*How would interstellar reddening affect your results?
    A) What is interstellar reddening?
    B) Would all star on your color magnitude diagram be equally    affected?

I define part A as you will see, and state that is will affect results--but don't really get into why. As far as I have gathered, it exists with most star clusters but metallicity rates for Pleiades helps it adhere to the ZAMS better than most even though there is reddening. So would this mean that there is reddening, but it is negligible? Furthermore, I'd say that not every star on the diagram would adhere to this because sometimes clusters appear to have stars in them that may be quite a distance further away, but due to their magnitudes, they appear to align with the others. But how does distance correspond to more reddening, more distance equals more dust to travel through I assume? So I would say there would be some possible outliers. I don't feel I need the internet so much to say that part. I'm, mainly struggling with. The how, and how I can prove it. 


Here's my go thus far. any comments on redundancy or anything is welcome. I am citing anything in quotes.


**“In astronomy, interstellar reddening is a phenomenon associated with interstellar extinction where the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source changes characteristics from that which the object originally emitted. Reddening occurs due to the light scattering off dust and other matter in the interstellar medium. Interstellar reddening is a different phenomenon from redshift, which is the proportional frequency shifts of spectra without distortion” (Extinction (astronomy), Wikipedia).  This basically means that there is obstruction between the observer and the celestial object in question. In addition to dimmer starlight, stellar objects appear redder. This is linked to Rayleigh Scattering. On Earth, Rayleigh Scattering can be attributed to atmospheric extinction. It is directly correlated to absorption of UV light through the ozone, the passage of light through water in the atmosphere, and altitude. It’s what makes the sun appear orange or red at sunset or sunrise. Interstellar reddening can indeed affect the original data and results compiled. Astronomers have found examples of 3D interstellar reddening in the Milky Way galaxy using ultra-violet spectroscopy, x-rays, near infrared, and visible observations. In regards to the Pleiades cluster examined in this investigation, interstellar reddening did affect out our result.**

what is your position/understanding/reasoning? metaphysics and astrophysics.,1391412039,"I have not come anywhere close to having a full understanding of astrophysics. But as a curious human and with the hopes of being 'better' and increasing my knowledge I have been able to crudely paint myself a picture of the nature of existence. It is with that same curiosity that I wonder what others who have come to such knowledge have been able to deduce, and what can be learned from those similarities and differences. How does your knowledge of physics/astrophysics relate to your understanding or metaphysics?

I think it would be unfair to ask for a response without giving my explanation so here is a nutshell and i will elaborate if anything is unclear, simply put: 

-Everything is connected. Singularity (like that at the center of our sun, SMBH... and everything in one way or another) is typologically representative of knowledge, relation, and love. It appears in and effects all things.

-the cause of all existence/our galaxy/all galaxies is (for simplicity sake i will say) dualism- The separation of a whole into opposite components- this is illustrated by both the event horizon side (feminine, Chaos driven, subjective, entropy/anisotropy) of the black hole and the side that emits hawking radiation (masculine, reorganization, objective, enthalpy/isotropy).

-electromagnetism- The driving energy of our planet, our solar system/galexy, and all life conscious to non conscious. Like the heart in your chest or changing weather illustrate my point.

-weak nuclear forces - Force of decay, capable of changing the state of quarks. Much like your stomach changes the state of the things you consume. 

-strong NF - ""100 times stronger than electromagnetism"", the heart wants what it wants, but a person has other needs indeed (wink). It also happens that through this our sun has given life to this planet.

-and gravitation- a force which brings things back to center, recollecting/reorganizing them. the basic force required for matter to constitute itself ( atmoic/subatomic, cellular activity, and matter in its pure form before consciousness manifests). They say one shouldn't lie down after eating, I won't tell you what to do, but there is a reason.

** these concepts as well as many others I haven't added here show the nature of all things from galactic to subatomic, and it is only in the past decades that the picture has become clear enough to see. It has been discussed from the Upanishads, ancient Mayan and Babylonian cultures crudely discovered key principles, Kant contributed to Schopenhauers 'the world as will and representation'. artists of all types, and Einstein with the help of those before and after have been filling in blanks. And it is even hard to argue that any dualist idealism did not contribute to overall understanding.  

do you find these interpretations to be accurate, somewhat accurate or false? why? What is your interpretation of the interactions you see around you?

**I am aware that this might sound like i am Jim Carrey in 'the Number 23' seeing patterns in nothing. Honestly, sometimes I feel insane in this world. But if i have to sound insane to learn something then so be it! I believe the difference is between those who act on such insanity and those who reflect on it. I am contemplative.

This topic could cause a fuss, perhaps even spark anger in some who believe. All I know is I am trying to learn, and to learn how to be good. Because if I don't know or know how it is more than likely i will fail, statistically speaking.

Anyone have trouble with Miriad and CARMA?,1387203278,"Hey all,

I'm currently doing some research during my undergrad years. I've been given some sets of data taken from CARMA to try to reduce. I was also provided with a script from someone who's considered a pro at miriad (I can't remember his name currently, sorry) that's to help me reduce the data.

For some reason, most of the sets are having all their data flagged. There are 3 sets out of about 18 that don't have the data flagged. The script always fails at ""task invert: no visibilities to plot"". Has anyone ever had this problem? And a possible fix?

I've tried not flagging any of the data myself (so it tries to use all of it). I've tried flagging parts of the data (specific times or a telescope for the entire reading). Neither of those seems to have an impact on making the script not flag all the data.

Question about Astronomy schooling,1386445803,"Hi, I'm an aspiring Astronomer. I won't get too deep into my background here other than I'm 23, live in Seattle WA, I'm engaged, and I've never wanted to do anything more in my life than be an astronomer. 

This isn't a question about what my potential careers are going to be. I'm not worried about that. What I want to know is about the schooling process. Right now I'm a freshman at a community college working to get my 2 year transfer degree to the UW for Astronomy. Maybe possibly I might want to continue after my BS with a doctorate but I don't want to get too ahead of myself. 

The question is, how hard and in depth is the schooling. While looking at the courses required for astronomy I noticed it's basically just tons and tons of physics classes. Everyone I have ever talked to said that physics is impossibly hard and that I shouldn't go for this degree because it's useless. None of them have a degree in anything physics or science related. Obviously I want to prove them wrong. This is the only thing I want to do with my life. But I'm a little worried. I'm getting married this summer (between 1st and 2nd year at community college) and right now I'm working delivering pizzas on the weekend. I guess what I want to know is that this type of school is possible for a person in my position. I'm not 18 years old. I didn't graduate high school. I got my GED and spent the last couple years gradually taking community college classes under the 100 level just to be able to start my transfer degree. I'm going to be married soon. I guess I'm just worried that, because I'm not a typical straight-out-of-high-school student, I'm not going to make it. NO ONE thinks I can do this except for my fiancee. Obviously I'm very down on myself about this. I'm trying my 110% hardest to keep up my spirit and do this for myself one step at a time but I would just like some reassurance. 

So I ask you, r/astrophysics, is it possible for me to get this degree? What circumstances did you have when you went to school? Were you married? Did you have a job while you went? Did you have support from family(emotionally and financially)? I would feel really comforted knowing that others have struggled through things like this and came out on top. 

-main question I have: Did you work part time while you were in school? If so, was it hard with the amount of school work you had to do?

I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. If these questions are too personal for you to answer then please, skip them. But I would like to hear your opinion on the matter.

However, with my limited experience, it does seem a viable possibility, so I may as well ask:

Is it possible that dark matter could actually be matter that is concealed within the additional spatial dimensions proposed by string theory?  Since extra dimensions are not, at this point, able to be observed, might dark matter be able to nestle right along with that quality of an extra dimension? Another product of dark matter is the bending of light. We know it's there, but we just can't find it. What if we can't see it because we are only looking for it among the traditional three spatial dimensions?  The mass would still have a presence within the fabric of space, but from a 3-dimensional standpoint, it wouldn't appear to exist.

Question about the age of the universe,1383259588,"I was stuck in traffic the other day, and a thought occurred to me.  

The universe has been calculated to be roughly 13.8 billion years old.  Now, obviously, a year is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to orbit around the Sun.

Objectively, however, what is a year?  Suppose humans had somehow come to life on Pluto, and that was our frame of reference.  Since a year on Pluto is longer than a year on Earth, how would we calculate the age of the universe?  Or what if, again somehow, we weren't orbiting any star, and we did not have that frame of reference?

The question I'm trying to get at is, is there some sort of universal constant (not an Earth year) that is used for this calculation?  If not, how accurate is our current calculation? ",astrophysics,advancednovice,/r/astrophysics/comments/1pnerr/question_about_the_age_of_the_universe/,6

If said situation is possible we would be looking at satellite damage in orbit... how extensive would this damage be to our current infrastructure?

Antimatter Universe Theory,1382042763,"I guess calling it a theory is a little much, more like conjecture that I'm hoping to get some input on. It goes something like this.


It's been theorized before that our universe actually contains large amounts of antimatter, but the idea was refuted on the basis that this would cause a large amount of gamma radiation release at the edge of these regions of space. 


I believe however, that this may not be the case. Or rather that it is the case, but that the gamma radiation is undetectable for reasons I will explain.


What started me on this train of thought was the thought that if antimatter regions of space existed, they likely have stars comprised of antimatter as well. Now, if these stars are traveling reverse in time, as Feynman theorized about antimatter, from our point of view they would be regions of space that act as a sink for massive amounts of energy as antimatter helium broke down into hydrogen.We would also see low levels of gamma radiation absorption. 



Now this would mean that from our point of view, matter-antimatter annihilation at the edges of these regions would produce gamma radiation, which would then be sucked toward the antimatter sun. This seems a little far-fetched unless you consider the idea of retrocausality, which would not be that far fetched in a region of space running in reverse time. From the ""view"" of the antimatter universe, these border regions would be absorbing gamma radiation to produce matter and antimatter, in which case it makes perfect sense for that gamma radiation to be coming from the nearest source, the anti-star.

I know this seems a little far fetched, and we obviously need to learn more about antimatter and antimatter-matter interactions before we can really know, but from a theoretical standpoint, is there any reason it couldn't be possible? It would account for the presence of dark matter and dark energy, as well as for why it appears like we live in a matter-dominated universe.

Question From an Author for the Astrophysics Redditors out there.,1382040227,"Hey all, I hope this is an okay place to post this, but I wanted to check a concept of mine's validity before I started on major edits to implement  them.

The set up is basically this: I am writing a fantasy novel, and, through a bunch of different ideas all coming together, rather than simply have it take place on an Earth-like planet, I decided to have it take place on an Earth-like moon orbiting a planet like Jupiter. I understand there are a lot of other physics issues here (ie: the pull of the planet's gravity on the moon itself, and so forth) but for the sake of somewhat simplification i'm treating the as gravity Earth-like.

So, what I am wondering mostly is on Day/Night cycles, and how it would look on this particular moon. For the sake of simplification, again, I am also assuming it takes 24 hours for the moon to do a full rotation and that the moon orbits the planet every 28 days. My understanding leads me to believe that if this was the case that 14 of those days would be spent getting progressively longer day (including the light from the planet itself reflecting on to the moon) followed by progressively longer nights for the next 14, like a condensed version of the arctic day/nights.

So, am I way off? Or am i slightly on the right track?

why is the universe expanding at an increasing rate?,1379301060,"as far as i know, astrophysicists are still confounded by the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. since we understand that bodies of mass exude a gravitational pull which strengthens with proximity and size, it makes sense that as bodies of mass spread further away from each other, their gravitational pull would become increasingly weaker which would then accelerate that dispersion. but that seems like too obvious an answer, so surely physicists must have denounced that theory already. does anybody know why that would not be the reason for the universe's increasing expansion rate?

i've also considered that gravity might not be a pulling force; rather, it causes ripples in space-time which influences the paths of objects around it. if that is the case, though, could we picture space as a table cloth with grid lines, all scrunched up with wrinkles and ripples? as the sources of those wrinkles separate, the table cloth would smooth. to an observer above, looking onto the 2 dimensional table cloth, it would appear that the grid lines stretch and separate further apart. so if an object is traveling at a constant rate from grid line A to grid line B, it would appear to the observer that the object is speeding up, when really it is the grid which is smoothing causing the appearance of an increased distance from A to B. the conclusion being that it's possible the expansion of the universe is not accelerating but constant.

In many sci-fi depictions the asteroid fields are very dangerous and chaotic. I suspect that this is very far from reality; considering an asteroid belt like the one in our earth system, if you were to insert a spacecraft in similar orbit and velocity, that spacecraft would be able to safely navigate the inside of a belt with relatively little danger even if that belt had thousands times more asteroid density than our own belt. In relation to the spacecraft, the behavior of asteroids would be very predictable, not chaotic at all. I assume that the asteroids within a belt are all moving roughly the same direction/orbit and at roughly the same velocity.

I would be very interested to know if these assumptions are correct.",astrophysics,[deleted],/r/astrophysics/comments/1icgrr/questions_regarding_navigating_an_asteroid_field/,0

I couldn't find much of an answer online either, so using the minimal knowledge bestowed upon me my first year I decided to just write out my thoughts on the subject via a few doodles. I had pretty much forgotten about it until that thread popped up a while back about how they found 26 large black holes near the center of a galaxy, and since that pretty much exactly coincides with what I thought I decided I should pop over here to see if I what I drew is similar to what we think happened.

"I'm writing Stellc, an open source library in clojure for analyzing variable stars and their lightcurves. I'd like some feedback on making it useful for as many people as possible.",1369986496,"Hi, I'm an undergrad physics/compsci dual major, aiming to go to grad school for astrophysics, and currently working on a research project. Last year I started doing a research project involving cepheid variable stars, hosted [here](https://github.com/Rosnec/first-overtone-cepheid-pl-template) on github. For those of you who aren't familiar with cepheids, they're a type of star which is extremely useful in measuring interstellar distances ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Cepheid_variable#Period-luminosity_relation)), and I suggest reading up a bit on them. If you're never done research involving cepheid variable stars and their light curves, then you're probably not going to know a lot of what I'm talking about, but hey, that's astro research for ya. If you want to get into astro research then get used to not understanding 90% of what you're reading.

I reached my initial research goals this winter, and didn't go any further with it while I was busy with classes. Now that I'm on summer break and have time to continue my research, I decided instead of continuing to work with code so monolithic and hard to use by anyone but myself, I would redesign everything I did from scratch, using a library of tools designed for anybody studying variable stars to use. I also decided to switch from using Common Lisp to clojure (another Lisp dialect), as it's more versatile and modern.

This library of tools is called Stellc (Stel as in stellar, and lc as in lightcurve), though that may change (any other name ideas?), and it is hosted on [github](https://github.com/Rosnec/stellc/) and [clojars](https://clojars.org/stellc). Currently it's in a very alpha stage, missing many of the most useful features, but is improving fast. It's written entirely in [clojure](clojure.org), and distributed under the GNU General Public License.

I've only had my own limited experience in studying cepheids, and know almost nothing about any other types of variable stars, so I'd like to hear what kinds of tools others who make use of variable star lightcurves need. So far I plan to make tools to read data from text files into custom datatypes, perform [fourier analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis), output graphs of lightcurves, and output data in text files for external programs to use. After I'm satisfied with this as a library, I'll be making a command line interface to extend its use beyond clojure programmers, but that won't happen anytime soon. The fact that it's in clojure, however, means it should be of some use to Java programmers as well, as clojure runs on the JVM and has interoperability with Java.

I'd really love for this to become a tool for professional astronomers to use, although that seems unlikely, especially since Lisp isn't used too extensively in the scientific community. Let me know what you think.

Formation of the moon question (sort of),1368584493,"No one will answer this in /r/askscience because it would require mostly a hypothetical answer.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm basing my question on these facts:

I believe it is pretty well accepted that the moon was formed long after a collision with a mars sized planet with the Earth.  

The distance from the Earth to the moon is increasing steadily albeit slowly.  The Moon gains slight momentum from the tides because the Earth rotates much faster on it's own axis than the Moon does around the Earth.

There would be a point in time when the Moon reaches an equilibrium orbit and is no longer increasing it's distance from the Earth, but that timescale is on the order of billions of years and will never happen in reality.

I also have recently read that most of Earth's water was present upon it's formation and gained very little over time.

My question is this:  How is it possible that the Moon formed in such a low orbit to begin with?  Is it because the accretion disc that the Moon formed from was more uniform and wasn't massive enough to pull the tides of the Earth to begin with?  Or that the formation of the Moon took such a long time to gain it's final mass that it wasn't pulling the tides?  Or do you think that the density of the Earth was more uniform and that the oceans took much longer to separate from the other molten compounds of the Earth not yet giving the Moon it's extra constant tidal push?  

What do you guys think?

Advice on choosing a college major,1367451510,"tldr; is there a college major that combines civil engineering, environmental engineering, and space?


Unfortunately I was not one of the lucky few who knew exactly what major they wanted to choose upon graduating from high school. I ended up picking Computer Science because I thought I may be interested in it, but after taking three quarters of it now I haven't found nearly as much fulfillment as I imagined I would have.

A few weeks ago I found a short essay/lecture from a man who was trying to basically sum up all of the wisdom he had gathered in his life and share it with today's maturing generation. One thing he said that really stuck with me was that the goal of a person's life should be to find their passion and just keep doing whatever they were passionate about; to paraphrase, 'if you haven't found your passion yet then make the search your passion'. Feeling unsatisfied with compsci, I've spent the past few weeks trying to research other majors that may interest me and hopefully bring more satisfaction.

The first field I looked into Engineering, specifically Civic and Environmental. I found the idea of designing and manipulating the elements used to create a city/society, and projects like Open Source Ecology seem like things that I might really enjoy myself getting involved in. However, I was unsure of how it would play out because I had terrible experiences with AP/IB Physics in high school and wasn't sure how much overlap there would be.

It wasn't until today, though, that I think I found something to tie it all together: I was browsing reddit and somehow ended up on the Astronomy subreddit, watching a linked video featuring a speech by Neil deGrasse Tyson (We stopped dreaming, Part 2). When I saw the shot of Earth rising over the Moon's horizon, it coupled with the music led me to start sobbing; shoulders hunched, pain in my throat, uncontrollable sobbing.

That was the first time I considered trying to find a way to integrate space in with an interest in engineering design, and I think I might finally find a passion if there is a way to bring these fields together. So to wrap up this post, I'm looking for advice in regards to if there is some sort of college major offered that effectively mixes civil and environmental engineering with a focus on space.

Questions about supernovas/blackholes and expansion,1366434976,"Hey, this is a great subreddit I wanted to first say. I love physics, particularly in the context of space. lets just get to the point then right?

1.) When gravitational collapse occurs, the star explodes. But the black hole is also formed upon the collapse. I'm having difficulty understanding how the black hole can remain after the release of all that energy which would seem substantial enough to eviscerate the integrity of the black hole (unless theyre really that strong). 

Also, I've heard two variations for the genesis of elements higher than iron. The first is that upon collapse, atoms are fused. the amount of energy needed to achieve fusion of iron would come from the collapse. The other version, one I heard from Hawking is that it occurs upon explosion of the star - as matter is being ejected. 

2.) Expansion. The universe is expanding as different lines of evidence suggest. everything is red-shifted from us (is andromeda?). My confusion comes when thinking about the position and speed of every galaxy. It seems the universe is homogenous: I think about the expansion as a result of the big bang and have problems understanding how the universe can be homogenous. Why is the matter at the putative center of the universe, what I would consider the location of the big bang, moving, and why is there any at the location?

**My theory on the big-bang and the cycle of the universe.**

So, if all the spiral galaxies is orbiting super-massive black holes, how long will it take before all matter in the universe is in one or another black hole? what happens when these black holes starts pulling on and consuming each other? What happens if all the matter in the universe get's compressed together into a tiny little spec? 

I think that if an unfathomable amount of time passes everything in the universe will be sucked in to a black hole of some sort. And eventually these black holes will start consuming each other and at some point in time there will be no mass left in the universe for it to feed of. I theorize that it will kinda fade out and loose its hold on the matter it contains and thus the matter explodes outward and creates another universe from the old one that was consumed.

I'm guessing I am wrong, i just want to put it out there.

If what in general relativity are conceived as gravitational singularities are in fact, from some unattainable frame within, inflationary universes like ours, how does that jive with the theory that the early universe contained mostly hydrogen and other simple elements? If that universe within the black hole is in some sense created from the matter and energy that the black hole engulfs, shouldn't that inner universe be just as chemically complex as its ""parent"" universe?

I realize this is way out on a speculative limb, but I'm hoping someone with knowledge in this area will humor me and help me understand a bit more about this theory.

Determining the orbit of an unidentified star,1360097986,"I am doing a problem in which I have to determine the orbit of an unidentified star, as seen from two space ships.

So far I have gathered the location of the star at two points relative to the sun:
at t1= 0                     : r_1 = 3.2786e+011 m theta_1 = 39.1502 deg
at t2= 2.6784 * 10^6s  : r_1 = 2.4592e+011 m theta_1 = 46.1269 deg

Using Kepler's 2nd law (angular momentum is constant), I have deduced the the angular velocity of the unidentified star to be (theta_2 - theta_1) / (t2-t1) = 2.6048*10^-6 rad/s.

The problem also states that you can assume the perihelion of the unidentified starts orbit to be at theta = 0.

So, I made this [diagram](http://imgur.com/xRozXhc?1)

I figured that since the perihelion is on the x-axis of the sun, that I could just mirror the two data points that I have over the x-axis, and then using the constant angular velocity, I deduced the time at which the star's orbit would cross those points.

Now here's where I am stuck.. how can I use Kepler's law to figure out what the shape of the orbit is? I don't want to just assume it's an ellipse. First, I need to find angular momentum, eccentricity, total energy and velocity of object at t=0. I'm hoping maybe finding these will help me determine the orbit.

I feel I must be able to use the constant angular momentum law, and the fact that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas per unit time to somehow get to the solution....

Could anyone give me a push in the right direction?

Need some help determining the orbit of an object,1360041751,"So, I have been working on this problem and FINALLY got to a point where I have determined the position of an unidentified object relative to the sun at two different points in time.

I need to use the orbit formula to determine that angular momentum, eccentricity, total energy of the orbit and velocity of the object when first sighted.

So using Kepler's laws, I know that angular momentum is conserved. I use my data to find angular velocity by doing 

(theta_2 - theta_1) / t = 4.312*10^-8 rad/s

So I can find the velocity of the object when first sighted:

velocity_1 = (angular velocity) * r_1

How can I get angular momentum from this data without knowing the moment of inertia?? Can anyone push me in the right direction?

&gt;In general, an ordinary star and one with a wormhole at its center would look the same to a distant observer. But if the wormhole has a strong enough influence, it might alter properties such as the mass or size of the stars in a nonstandard way.

Question:

What if wormholes were common place? Say we have Star A and Star B, which are connected by a wormhole. When measuring the mass of Star A or Star B individually, we are actually measuring both stars together. Various configurations of wormholes would fool us into over-counting the mass of certain areas of space, perhaps sometimes by several factors.

If this were true, then concentrations of dark matter (i.e. unaccounted for gravity) might indicate concentrations of wormholes.

Opinions Please. Am I to old and broken?,1353604767,"I would like to fish for some opinions. Title may be misleading. 

I am not that old. 29 Years old however I feel broken. A little back story before I get to my main question.

Growing up I was a smart kid, grew up in the country, spend every night staring up into the stars. We had minimal light pollution so it was amazing. Was always at the top of my class until we moved and I made new friends. It was 8th grade when my grades began to slip, I stopped caring and only wanted to cause trouble with my new friends. We go into drugs and I lost interest at the time in the sky. I jumped around and went to different high schools, nothing seemed to get me on track so I took my GED and went on with life. I was still pretty bright just seemed uneducated. Had excellent problem solving skills but lacked a fundamental base. Now that I was not going to school I had to find a job. I started into the IT field as computers came second nature. What a boring field. I didn't enjoy it but continued on as I needed a steady paycheck to pay for my life. About 10 years ago I attended a new years eve party and partook in some Ecstasy. The night began fine but as it progressed I was fed and partook in more and more. By the end of the evening I had taken 8 tabs. Way to much. I made it home and suffered through the hangover. Instantly I could tell my photographic memory was gone. I could tell I seemed slower. Broken. I was still pretty sharp but not like before. Something changed. Now that I felt broken, lost confidence and slugged through a tech support job that a monkey could perform I got depressed. Basically my life up until a couple years ago. I visited the Houston Museum of Natural Science and attended a show in the planetarium. Reignited my desire. Living in the big city for so long you lose sight of the stars. I had almost forgotten what it was like to see them again. Consumed by a desire to learn brings me to here and now. My brain has been improving as the years go by. It is no where near what it was but it is an improvement.

 I would like to go back to school. I plan on taking some brush up high school algebra classes and bring myself back up to the community college level. I plan to work on getting my associates in physical science and proceed into my BS and beyond in astrophysics. My question to you all. With so much school looming in front of my, a poor high school record and age never slowing down will I still be taken seriously? I know there is lots of school that I need to take. I understand the math I will need to learn and relearn. 

 In your professional and or amateur opinions do I still have a chance in this field? I am optimistic that I could succeed if I put forth the effort and show that I am not the immature teen age kid who ruined his future with sex, drugs, and rock and roll! 

Would you give a middle aged man who just  graduated a chance? It would all be moot if I spend all this money on college only to get passed up for the younger individual.

Novice seeking book recommendations,1352868435,"I'm a thirty y/o professional game developer with too much spare time who'd like to start learning astrophysics... but I don't quite know where to start.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.  I also have a M.S. in Computer Graphics.  So, I'm no stranger to math... I took four calculus classes as an undergrad, and graphics/game development is all about the linear algebra.  I also took two and a half years of physics in high school and another two courses in college.  I was even planning on minoring/majoring in physics, but my school's one and only physics professor was less than fantastic.

I've been doing professional video game development as a software engineer for seven years now, and even though I love it, it's not as fresh and challenging as it was seven years ago.  About a year ago, I began toying with going back to school to get a master's in astrophysics.  I love physics, I can cope with math, and astronomy has been a life long fascination.  Oh, and my programming skills might come in handy too.

The range of careers for astrophysics seem quite narrow, to say the least.  So, I don't really foresee myself leaving my career as a game developer for a career in astrophysics, but, I would still like to study it for the challenge, to satisfy my curiosity, and to, generally speaking, be a better rounded individual.

With that said, spending $25,000-$50,000 on a master's degree seemed a bit superfluous.  Then, one day not too long ago, I realized, ""hey, I teach game development to others (I'm a part-time professor), why can't I just teach myself astrophysics?""  With that thought lodged securely in my brain, learning astrophysics on a budget of $200 per textbook instead of $2500 per class suddenly seemed much more reasonable.

The question now, and the one I pose to you, is, ""where do I start?""

My physics and math are a bit rusty, and a refresher wouldn't hurt, but probably isn't incredibly necessary. 

I recently watched the entire series of Khan Academy videos on astrophysics and greatly enjoyed them.  Now, I'm looking for something a bit heavier, and in book/textbook form.

I bought ""Astrophysics is Easy!"" by Mark Inglis on my Kindle but had to return it b/c all of the diagrams were missing, which, is too bad b/c it seemed like it would have been a good intermediary book.  Now, I'm looking at ""Astrophysics in a Nutshell"" by Dan Maoz, but, I'm worried it may be a bit too technical.

So, any suggestions?  And, for good measure, here's a twist... I'm physical disabled and have a hard time handling physical books, so, books that I can get digitally are much preferred.",astrophysics,speedy7878,/r/astrophysics/comments/135zev/novice_seeking_book_recommendations/,10

If Jupiter were to explode tomorrow,1352528547,"Hey guys,
I am writing as science fiction story for a class, and a central premise in the story is that Jupiter explodes (the how and why I don't really want to explain right now, haha, but eventually one day, I may just share the story here!). However, while writing it, it occurred to me that I can't just have Jupiter disappear... surely there have to be some gravitational perturbation effects caused by the explosion as well?
I was wondering if anyone with any expertise could give me a general picture as to what would happen if Jupiter were to disappear tomorrow. I have the following ideas in mind, and any appendages to them, or corrections (or new ideas altogether) would be greatly appreciated!

a) Jupiter's gravity pulls the inner planets a bit outward away from the sun. In the absence of Jupiter, the inner planets would 'sink in' towards the sun, causing Mercury to crash into the sun, Venus to get closer, Earth to get closer (and get hotter, causing most life to go extinct), and Mars to get closer. 

b) The outer planets would probably experience orbital disturbances.

c) Jupiter's inner satellites would probably be destroyed in the same explosion, whereas the outer ones would go flying off, careening either into the other gas giants and their satellites, or the asteroid belt

d) The asteroid belt itself would coalesce into a planet, in the absence of Jupiter's tidal forces ripping it apart.

e) Conversely,  entropy might prevent the asteroid belt to coalesce; the only disturbances the asteroid belt would experience would be from the incoming satellites (or fragments of satellites) that once belonged to Jupiter.

Please forward your ideas, if you have any! All help would be greatly appreciated! :)

"What shape is the universe?  No really, what is it?",1351404943,"Every time I ask this question of people, I get the same responses that they got out of a general astronomy book.

The general consensus seems to point to the universe being flat thanks to the lack of distortion predicted in saddle and spherical models from [WMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe).  Cool, that's super.  What the hell does that mean?  (Yes, I know it's talking about predicted spreads in the WMAP survey but what does that imply?)

Observation project ideas,1350577115,"For a third year Astrophysics module, we have been asked to 'plan and implement' an observatory practical using our uni telescopes.

That's it! The only guidance we have is it must be concerning objects outside the solar system but not extragalactic... it's a 'Physics of Stars' module, regarding the foundation, evolution and death of stars, so studying stars in our galaxy makes sense.

We haven't really been told how long the project is for either, though I suspect it is meant to stretch over both semesters.

As you can see, the lecturer is a little ambiguous at best.

However, due to the fact I have spent 2 years learning all I can about physics and stars and planets and quarks and... now is the time we get a chance to actually do some physics!

Have access to several telescopes remotely and want to do something more than 'take images of these'... which has so far been our total input so far for observations.

Fostering a love for astrophysics?,1349853281,"Hello r/Astrophysics. This is my first post in this subreddit.

I'm currently 18 years old and a film student at Florida State University. I'm very thrilled to be in this program and love film with all my heart. Unfortunately the program itself does not properly start until next year, so this year I am filling my schedule with classes that interest me for 12 credits. One of them is an introductory Astronomy course. I have always had an interest in the cosmos, but never pursued it. This class, however, has thrilled me more than I thought possible.

In taking it, I've spent a lot of time reading and watching lectures (I particularly love listening to Neil deGrasse Tyson, but that's not at all surprising) and just learning all that I can about it. I'm loving it tremendously, and was saddened to learn recently that following this Astronomy class, I have reached the end of astrophysics options for non-majors. While I do not want to switch my major, I similarly do not wish to simply accept that this is the end of my astrophysics growth.

So now I turn to the internet, and specifically to you, reddit. I am looking to find ways to continue pursuing astrophysical learning in my own time, at my own pace. I am no stranger to basic physics, but when it comes to more advanced topics (relativity, for instance; my physics knowledge is limited to Newtonian) I am woefully ignorant. What sources should I turn to? I've considered purchasing the Feynman Lectures on Physics and working my way through them gradually, and am currently reading a few astrophysics specific books - Carl Sagan's Cosmos is sitting on my desk and I recently ordered one of NdGT's books on the origin of the universe.

I've also considered investing in a telescope. I assume a decent reflector telescope is what I should be looking for, but otherwise I am clueless as far as what I should look into. I've been reading r/Astronomy for more info here, but if any of you have advice I'd appreciate it.

Further, while there are no astrophysics-specific courses available, I will have the option of taking General Physics 1 and Calculus 1. While I already have credit for the latter after having taken AP Calculus in high school, I think that taking a general Physics class could help on some level. Is this an accurate assumption, or am I way off?

**TL;DR: How should I, in my own time, pursue and cultivate an interest in astrophysics? What books should I read, what magazines should I look into, and should I invest in a telescope?**

**EDIT:** I'd like to add that, although the class is labeled as an astronomy class, the professor is a particle physicist who has thus far treated it from a very astrophysical standpoint. No constellations or astrology garbage.

Question: 1st Part

Is is possible that all singularities are actually the same singularity?

My reasoning

If a singularity is a condition in which time and space no longer exist in any coherent way, it seems to me that its ""location"" in the universe could also be singular in nature. 

2nd Part:

I learned somewhere that atomic nuclei take on infinite density the deeper you look. I don't know if I heard that right, though. If it is true, would that indicate the presence of a singularity?

Silly Shower thoughts - Fire,1346248017,"I think a lot when I am in the shower. A time to reflect and think about all that has happened around me and to piece thoughts together from different experiences.

Today’s thought was about fire, well, not so much fire but heat. But it came from a picture of fire. I started to think about how maybe there is no such thing as gravity. All the pictures of lensing are usually done by a star, heat. The heat bends space around the star thus creating the lens. Usually when something is large (mass) then it can lens stuff as well. But usually the bigger the object is the hotter it is.

The second piece of the puzzle came the other day when they talked about phase changing from the big bang. Where everything was hot and as it cooled the structure of the universe started to come together. So, from that prospective, heating and cooling played another part in the construction of the universe. 

Then I started to think a little of relativity and how those grid lines around objects. Usually, the hotter the object the more it warped space around it. I always, have had a hard time imaging how a super nova could cause a black hole. How could something ejecting so much matter then collapse on its self to form a black hole – heat. The heat that is ejected warps space and makes space collapse back on itself.

Going off in a crazy direction, I have always thought it was weird to hear something was hot / cold when they mean good or bad. Where did this get imprinted onto our molecules? Heat = good, cool = bad?  Usually the ""hotter"" something (someone) is the more we are pulled towards it. 

TL;DR - I usually think of things from my surroundings and I’m sorry if I wasted your time for my thought. I think heat maybe what we describe gravity.

Then I began thinking of the milk as the fabric of spacetime. Imagine we are a Cheerio floating atop the milk. All we will ever be able to see and experience is floating on top of the milk with us. But if you add more and more mass to the Cheerio, it won't float anymore and will merge past the ""membrane"" of the surface of the milk to under the surface of the milk (it will sink). Then that got me thinking about black holes. I was thinking how a black hole could be similar to the massive Cheerio sinking past the membrane of the surface of the milk, perhaps leading to another dimension or something (the abyss of milk below the surface).
In other words, a black hole could break the surface tension of spacetime (surface of milk where all matter [or cereal] floats) and lead to something similar like floating aimlessly in an abyss of milk (another dimension or something).

Make scientific history - help test this theory using your multibody animation system,1345567778,"Formation of the moon has been puzzling scientists for decades. the leading theory that a mars sized body struck earth at exactly the right angle to fragment pieces that formed the moon while the original impacting body did NOT mix with earth has been harmed by new evidence from moon rocks showing the moon is EXACTLY the same composition as earth (unlikely if a mars sized body hit earth and mixed ANY dirt.)

An interesting alternative theory is proposed by this guy who says that the earth was spinning faster only 65 million yrs ago while dinosaurs were alive and earth was still cooling and therefore shrinking and increasing density and thus rotation speed and more dense stuff sank increasing spin rate and less dense stuff rose to the equator formed a bulge held only by it's ""stickiness"". Then when earth spin rate had increased to about  7hrs a day it simply peeled off forming the moon.

Now you can debate it and read all about the evolutionary biology and age of the seafloor(65 million years) supporting this theory if you want (but NOT HERE here because this post is about testing the physics NOT his dinosaur extinction theory) but testing the physics would be good first.

We want to know if planets can indeed sling off moons as they spin up from cooling shrinkage and redistribution of the masses in their interiors.

How to test:
Your task -should you accept it- is to model varying density particles in proportions equal to combined earth moon elements in a primitive rotating body the size of earth plus moon and see if the less dense particles bulge to equator and then if they spin off and reform a moon with orbit around earth changing orbit and rotation speeds to the current earth moon parameters.

You should model some adhesion between particles (important for the peeling away and relative non destructive retention of surface as the moon with a varying density of heavier side toward earth.)

you must model gravity of the system DYNAMICALLY as individual gravity particles of varying density attracted together first as one then two bodies not two bodies with generalized gravity (that won't work).

You must model conservation of angular momentum of those same individual particles as the heavier ones sink to the center of the earth and the lighter ones head toward the equator which will change the speed of rotation of the earth system.

You also have to model shrinking of all the particles as they cool because this on one of the primary forces causing earth to spin more rapidly as it cools. and earth was still cooling and therefore increased density per radius 

To test if the theory is correct you should start with a earth/moon combo mass spinning faster in about 7 hrs for the length of a day bulging then slinging off pieces that reach net zero g at equator (gravity minus centripetal acceleration at equator results in net zero g at equator) and ending up with a moon and earth and an earth which slows down after slinging off the pieces that become the moon (and carrying away some angular momentum)

Obviously the moon pieces will at first be non round but if you model the particles individually they should coalesce to form a round moon with heavier particles near earth side just as real moon has (because earth's gravity causes the heavy side of the moon to be pulled and stabilized toward earth..

""If the earth spins at 24 hours per day, as it does today, then the force of gravity at the equator is about the same as the force of gravity at the north and south poles. If the earth spins faster, in about a 12 hour revolution day, then the force of gravity at the equator is around half of what it would be at the poles. And if the earth spins around in about 7 hours, then the force of gravity becomes rather close to zero at the equator, while the force at the poles remains the same. "" Also: ""A little further calculation can show that almost all of the moons in our solar system were ejected from their parent planet by this very same process. It is a natural part of the aging and evolution of planetary systems. As a rotating planet cools, it spins faster and faster, becoming oblate and unstable. It releases a moon from the oblate surface, just like Tara Lipinski ( an ice skater ) putting out her arms to slow down her spin, decreasing the planet's rotation rate and it becomes stable again. This may be repeated with the larger planets. After a long time, the larger planets continue to cool and shrink and release another moon. The larger the planet the more moons it produces to become stable.""


current nvidia cuda programming should allow immense numbers of particles to be modeled on your desktop if you have a decent modern nvidia graphics card.

even without cuda programming a decent multibody simulation might allow enough particles of varying density for a reasonable simulation.

Some of you MUST be doing multibody simulations now and could probably simply plug in 5,000 particles of varying density rotating in a mass about the size of earth/moon proto mass at around 7 hrs per day and see what happens.

I know that I have little hope of understanding the math and writing/understanding algorithms to simulate things like fluid dynamics and gravitational instability, so instead I want to try and simulate a protoplanetary disc as a horizontal cross-section with density, temperature, and shear force attributes. I can then use these attributes to calculate the a rough metric for stability per any radial section of the disc and from there work on simulating planet formation.

I THINK that this is possible - at to the extent that it won't give wildly unrealistic or physically impossible results. But I'm not exactly sure where to start. I was hoping that someone could point me in the right direction (or a direction in general). 

An example of where I might start is by writing an algorithm that will determine the average temperature of the disc at radius r given some basic info about its mass and density.

Thanks in advance!

What does it take?,1338438356,"What does it take to be a physicist? More specifically, what does it take to be an astrophysicist?
I didn't do that well in high school (apathy for everything except video games), and now attend UNL. When I get back to my sophomore year, I want to change my major to physics. In high school, I did poorly in physics, but I found it to be the only thing that was interesting (that and biology and english). It also wasn't until this last semester that I realized that I actually enjoy math and am decent at it, with scoring an 88% on my college algebra final (the best that I have ever done on a final for math) after taking the time to study.
I have a curious nature, enjoy learning, and want to help others, whether it be through scientific findings, or something else. Also, I have finally realized after reading 'How to think big' by David Schwartz that it's all about attitude and passion that matters, not how smart someone is. I have a great attitude toward everything and I think this is my passion, learning about the physical conundrums of the universe.
Do I have what it takes? What does it take? Am I too late in a quest for becoming a physicist?

Planning on going to grad school in Fall 2013. Torn between Aerospace Engineering and Astrophysics. Any advice?,1338345282,"So I got my undergrad at Georgia Tech in Chemical Engineering in May 2011. 3.22 GPA (kinda let that one slip, wasn't really planning on grad school at the time). Now I work at an oilfield lab in west Texas, and have decided that I definitely want to go back to school and get an advanced degree in something that I'm more interested in. 
 
After contacting multiple universities and looking over old/sample Physics GREs, I'm positive that I'd be able to get into at least a *decent* school for either Astrophysics or AE with my undergrad GPA and some decent recommendations.

I understand that if I go the Astro route, a PhD would pretty much be a must, and I have no problem with that. 

The way I've simplified it is that with Astrophysics, I could be studying the universe and celestial phenomena, whereas in Aerospace, I could be designing/researching spacecraft. Both seem like incredible opportunities to me. If you guys have any clarification of what things may actually be like, I'd welcome any input.

I guess I'm a little torn about pay and job availability. How easily would I be able to get a job in Astro? AE? Also, I'm currently under the impression that I'd have a better chance of making more money with AE, any truth in that?

So basically, any differences between the two that could help me make a decision would be great. I also welcome any anecdotes you might have on the matter.

A Brief Summary of Modern Astrophysics,1338251281,"Our modern understanding has advanced significantly since the primitive days and theories of Carl Sagan's times. Modern Cosmology has overturned and invalidated 20th century musings like Black Holes, Neutron Stars, Pulsars, Quasars, and Big Bang Creationism of Catholicism. Much of 21st Century Cosmology is disdained by the Public due to the fact that it challenges their sacred religious beliefs founded in the Book of Genesis and repudiates the idea of a Creation Event and challenging them to accept a Universe infinite in time &amp; space.

The following videos will give you the most accurate and truthful understanding of 21st Century Cosmology.

Universe: Cosmology Quest - [part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFFl9S39CTM), [part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb_EWnXCu2w).

On the cutting edge of Cosmology are the advocates of The Electric Universe, you can watch their groundbreaking documentary [Thunderbolts of the Gods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4zixnWeE8A). Professor Donald Scott, author of The Electric Sky, NASA guest lecturer, Ph. D of Electrical Engineering, highly praised by the most prestigious names in Government research like Anthony Peratt provides modern explanations for everything to the Sun, and debunking failed concepts like Pulsars and Black Holes using exciting science of Plasma Physics and Electrical Engineering. 

Key Scientists of 21st Cosmology aren't people like Stephen Hawking.

They are people like:

* Dr. Hannes Alfven

* Dr. Anthony Peratt

* Dr. Eric Lerner

* Natural Philosopher Wal Thornhill

* Dr. Donald Scott

* Dr. Ari Brynjolffson

* Dr. Halton Arp

The momentum of previous decades still weighs heavy in cosmological discussions. People have yet to upgrade their Cosmology Firmware and still believe in outdated concepts like the Big Bang, Black Holes, Pulsars, Neutron Stars, Dark Matter, &amp; Dark Energy.

Big Bang Creationism has long since been debunked through new modern interpretation of the Red Shift phenomenon by the world's leading Radiological expert Ari Brynjolffson. You can explore his website [Plasma Redshift](http://plasmaredshift.org)

Personally trained by Neils Bohr himself, Ari is one of the last remaining of a great generation of Scientists. He has been head of the Danish, US Army, and United Nations Radiological Research divisions. His scientific research, using the most advanced radiological and scientific instruments available in the world, prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that the Doppler Shift interpretation of Red Shift originally proposed by Catholic Preacher Georges Lemaitre is fundamentally flawed just as believed by Hubble &amp; Einstein. 

Brynjolffson has shown beyond any reasonable doubt that Red Shift is a consequence of the Electron Plasma Density, and the conclusion of this Emissary of the Prestigious U.N., U.S. Army, Danish, and other Institutes?

&gt; When photons penetrate a cold and dense plasma, they lose energy through ionization and excitation, Compton scattering on the individual electrons, and Raman scattering on the plasma frequency.  But in sparse hot plasma, such as in the solar corona, the photons lose energy also in plasma redshift.  The energy loss per electron in the plasma redshift is about equal to the product of the photon's energy and one half of the Compton cross-section per electron.  In quiescent solar corona, this heating starts in the transition zone to the corona and is a major fraction of the coronal heating.  Plasma redshift contributes also to the heating of the interstellar plasma, the galactic corona, and the intergalactic plasma.  Plasma redshift explains the solar redshifts, the intrinsic redshifts of stars, quasars, the galactic corona, the cosmological redshifts, the cosmic microwave background, and the X-ray background.  The plasma redshift explains the observed magnitude-redshift relation for supernovae SNe Ia without the big bang, dark matter, or dark energy.  It explains also the observed surface brightness of galaxies.  There is no cosmic time dilation.  The universe is not expanding. The plasma redshift, when compared with experiments, shows that the photons' classical gravitational redshifts are reversed as the photons move from the Sun to the Earth, provided they have adequate time to change their frequency.  This is a quantum mechanical effect.  As seen from the Earth, a repulsion force acts on the photons.  

Big Bang Creationism and Cosmology, despite still being popular in Christian countries as the dominant explanation has been debunked for over 50 years. **Plasma Cosmology** is the only real game in town.

Once the Doppler Theory of Redshift had been debunked, all the work of ""Expanding Universe"" Theoreticians that built their work on the idea of Doppler Redshift became instantly invalidated. Once Redshift moved from a Doppler interpretation, to one of the Photon's Journey through Interstellar Space, the work of popular names like Stephen Hawking suddenly became toilet paper, and a new generation waits in the wings to take the baton and advance humanities understanding of the Cosmos. As we come to better understand the Photon's Pipe Journey through Space, we will be able to see further into Space than ever before through improved adaptive optics. The Universe becomes infinite in age &amp; size and we are just opening our eyes to view deeper through the fog.

I recommend the following books:

* **The Big Bang Never Happened** by Dr. Eric J. Lerner 

* **The Electric Sky** by Dr. Donald E. Scott

* **Cosmic Plasma** by Dr. Hannes Alfven

* **Physics of the Plasma Universe** by Dr. Anthony Peratt

* **The Electric Universe** by Natural Philosopher Wal Thornhill

* **Plasma Redshift** by Dr. Ari Brynjolffson

* **Seeing Red** by Dr. Halton C. Arp

In closing, I find it is always important to note, that much of the public believes that the Michelson-Morley experiment upon which early 20th Century Science was developed remains valid. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was once believed that Space was a vacuum. Since our first probes into Space, we have found this is not true. Far from disproving the existence of the Aether, it has come that we have instead disproved the existence of a vacuum.

Space is a gigantic Sea of Plasma consisting of electrons, quarks, and other exotic charged particles. I can not stress this enough, there is no vacuum in Space. Despite the illusion of a vacuum, you are living in a gigantic sea of electrified plasma, a complex dusty plasma makes up our Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. This plasma is in a Dark Glow State, not enough energy goes into it to illuminate it, but we can see much of it through Infrared Telescopes. The ""seeing"" may seem great, but this electrified plasma currently limits our view to around 14 GLY and its density varies depending on the Electric Field of the object being encompassed by it. With the improved red-shifted viewing of the James Webb Space Telescope, its gold primary mirror will serve as an adaptive optic to this effect, allowing us to look further than ever before into the infinite sea of space.

Can the moon be considered a planet?,1337929077,"From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_planet)

&gt;A ""planet""1 is a celestial body that: (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.

If you trace the Moon's path in a Sun-centric frame of reference, that path is completely convex. Quoting [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon):

&gt;Unlike most other moons in the Solar System, the trajectory of the Moon is very similar to that of its planet. The Sun's gravitational pull on the Moon is over twice as great as the Earth's pull on the Moon; consequently, the Moon's trajectory is always convex (as seen when looking inward at the entire Moon/Earth/Sun system from a great distance off), and is nowhere concave (from the perspective just mentioned) or looped.

If the Earth suddenly vanished, the Moon would continue in its orbit around the Sun (the same is true of any satellite), and it's big enough that it would be considered a planet (if there were anyone left to consider it at all).

On the other hand, in an Earth-centric frame of reference, the Moon is in an elliptical orbit around the Earth (with some significant, but not overwhelming, perturbations caused by the Sun's gravity).

From the same article:

&gt;Some consider the Earth–Moon system to be a double planet because of the relatively large size of the Moon; the Earth–Moon mass ratio, about 81:1, is much smaller than that of most other natural satellites in the Solar System. An informal criterion for a double planet system is that its barycentre must be exterior to both bodies. By that criterion, the Earth and Moon are an ordinary planet–moon system, because their mutual distance is about 60 Earth radii but their mass ratio is 81:1 so their centre of mass always lies well within the Earth.

But that seems like a very arbitrary criterion. If the Moon were either about a third farther away or about a third more massive, the barycenter would be above the Earth's surface. Intuitively, it doesn't seem (to me) that that should be enough to make it a planet. But if the Earth and the Moon were of roughly equal mass, orbiting each other at about the same distance, then we'd probably call them a double planet system -- and the official definition of a planet would probably have been written a bit differently. (Then again, any such criterion probably has to be arbitrary.)

[The article on the definition of a planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_planet#Double_planets_and_moons) also discusses the controversy over whether the Earth-Moon system might be considered a double planet. It gives may reasons for it, but not against.

**So, my question is... Why not? It fulfills all the criterion...**

If we cannot say it is a planet, then a specific rule should be made for the cases of terrestrial planets with large 'moon's.",astrophysics,iddothat,/r/astrophysics/comments/u456g/can_the_moon_be_considered_a_planet/,9

I need to start relearning Math at an embarrassingly low level, Elementary Algebra, and I already know I need to not only learn, but understand and be fluent in advanced Calculus to be successful in this profession.

I'd love to at least be able to start the basics with that foundation during the next semester as I progress to Intermediate Algebra.

"Why ""Dark Matter"" behaves differently in a multi-galaxy collision.",1330909153,"Don't know the double slit test? (Yeah right, geek) Go [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc)

In it, a photon targeting photo film through a double slit creates an interference pattern when left unobserved during the process. However, if one attempts to observe/detect the photon traveling through both slits, it only travels through one, leaving 2 standard lines. The typical take from this is that quantum uncertainty breaks down because the process was observed, forcing a choice to be made. However, there's no reason that photons must be the only particle exhibits this uncertain state, and I believe we're getting a glimpse of that here.

The reason quantum uncertainty cannot be observed at laboratory scales is because the time scales would allow us to violate causality, and the universe doesn't allow for that. If ""dark matter"" is a form of Boson-like material, which it definitely seems to act like, it would make sense that it could gravitationally interfere with itself in multiple galaxy collisions. The key being that nothing had the opportunity to stop or alter these interactions, but each interaction had multiple spacial outcomes with equivalent probabilities. ""Observation"" actually just denotes a probability of interference, and the different ultra-massive pulls from various galaxies would create the uncertain path (double slit), as all mass centers involved would have multiple possible paths ahead of them. Since we had no ability to stop it when it happened, we get the pleasure of watching it now.

Gravity, as I see it, is the inversion and/or scattering of particle uncertainty when highly interacting particles clump together. Physicists would say that any object still maintains the possibility that it could fly part at the electron shell level (theoretically) at any moment. Think if it as a massive object's footprint spreading forward into time. Less massive objects (like you and I) near the surface of the larger simply become statistics in the largest worst-scenario desegregation, and the probabilities of where we end up are much less complex than the massive core of a planet.

The smaller, brighter masses of the continuing galactic parts of collision mentioned in the article were likely sling-shotted through because of the massive gravitational pull of the early dark matter interference, which likely significantly subsided in strength as the dark matter uncertainty was reigned in by the pull of the gravity of the normal matter. Why? Since normal matter can interact with so many more particles/forces, It's level of uncertainty is reduced by the number of nearby particles which could interfere with it. Therefore, it's gravitational footprint would remain relatively static and condensed. This would cause the dark matter (by this time lumped as observed above) to be pulled like a jetstream as the densely certain mass imposed just a bit more certainty on the dark matter around it, reducing the net gravitational pull.

TL;DR; I propose that Dark Matter's low rate of interaction gives rise to gravitational interference. As an echo of quantum uncertainty, it gives rise to large fluctuations in gravitational fields acting on normal matter. Normal matter counteracts this gravitational interference through via higher levels of certainty imposing on dark matter. Uncertainty seems to be a property of particles most purely interacting with forces. ",astrophysics,FesterCluck,/r/astrophysics/comments/qhutn/why_dark_matter_behaves_differently_in_a/,0

However, I expect some people here can help me out! I am also a total layperson, so hopefully these questions make sense?

1. The Big Bang implies that we could theoretically locate, in our 3-dimensional space, the starting point of the universe. If everything has been moving away from that point for 13.X billion years, doesn't that mean there is a massive void back there now? That is, shouldn't the universe be shaped sort of like a tennis ball, with most matter in this ""band"" moving outward, and a big void in the middle? If not, why not?

2. I understand that from any galaxy it appears that other galaxies in any direction are moving away from it, and the further away they are, the faster they are moving away. But shouldn't it be true that when you look out toward the leading edge of the universe (as opposed to the starting point), those galaxies should be moving away at least a tiny bit faster? Because they're further away from the center of gravity of the universe, there should be less force pulling on them. Also, things should be a little bit ""less dense"" out in that direction, no? Why can't we detect this?

3. The background radiation thing. So this is the ""faint echo of the Big Bang"". I get that, but at the same time I don't get it. If we consider a particular energy particle(?) we measure, and assume it was emited during the birth of the universe... what has is been doing the past 13.X billion years? Shouldn't that energy have been traveling **away** from the point of origin? And at the speed of light, which is faster than we've been moving to get where we are now. Has that energy sort of been bouncing off the leading edge of the universe forever or something? I dunno, this one confuses me a lot.

I have been doing some reading on the duality between black and white holes, and I was having a bit of trouble making sense of it. I sadly am a lowly fluid dynamicist, so quite humble when I am trying to entertain these topics. 

While I realize that black holes only have a size due to the relative diameter of their 'Event Horizon', much about the singularity still peaks my curiosity. The main thought that has persisted in my head is to follow a speck of mass into the hole. At a certain point the shear amount of forces will elongate it, and eventually will break it down into energy. But if you follow that spec to the singularity, time will begin to move arbitrarily slow, at least by our modest comprehension. Suppose you stuck with this speck for an amount of time that was arbitrarily close to infinite.

Can our current understanding and equations depict this re expanding after it nears a finite but incomprehensibly distant point in the future? If so, could this perhaps explain the Big Bang, where there was only blackness, due to the passing of so much time?

I realize that 11 dimensional hyperspace and string theory lend themselves towards this, but does this require the extra dimensional stand-point to equate? In the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker big bang equations, black holes are seen as an end point singularity, but could this be seen as a cyclical input to the big bang's singularity? And, if so, could this mean that the 'wormhole' concept is just the progression through an arbitrarily slow point of space time, leading to the funnel like diagrams that attempt to depict it?

Need some help for Astrophysics/Astronomy Homework [xpost from r/homeworkhelp],1329944617,"I have very little knowledge on Physics, Astronomy, and Geometry, so I'm above my head in this subject and I don't know where to start. It's the first week and we've only had one lecture, but this was the homework given to us:

My apologies for the images and the text size, I'm on a netbook and it's pretty small.

Could anyone please tell me how to calculate these questions with the information given? and possibly point me in the way of a good online resource for learning this? I'm not after the answers, but rather how to get them.

Thanks.
