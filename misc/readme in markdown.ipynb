    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project will put those skills to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For project 3, your goal is two-fold:\n",
    "1. Using [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.\n",
    "2. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushshift's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is use the following url: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?subreddit=boardgames\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use the API: https://youtu.be/AcrjEWsMi_E\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the recording from a previous cohort Breakfast Hour which will teach you how to use the API to create a PyScript and fully automate the collection process for posts, allowing you to passively collect as many posts as you need by running the script in Bash/CMD. The section to focus on is from **7:54** to **55:45**.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://generalassembly.zoom.us/rec/play/IEeFJ50KMX_1d4d6ACRj9caeqz_W3V9C3RP4XIOzn8ynAE83APpwbxF3ylJnSJXMFSiNmPo1oHw35Kpl.D1XBopdtlQNWilJ9?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=2ShimnfWRSqreUf7iKyVRg.1616787450820.4c6921ec8a66ba664a818cf81df2e461&_x_zm_rhtaid=107\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Pushshift now limits you to 100 posts per request (no longer the 500 in the screencast).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library.\n",
    "- **Create and compare two models**. One of these must be a Random Forest classifier, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.\n",
    "- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.\n",
    "- An executive summary of your results.\n",
    "- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary Deliverables / Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code must be in at least one clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- A readme/executive summary in markdown.\n",
    "- You must submit your slide deck as a PDF.\n",
    "- Materials must be submitted by **11:59 PM Eastern on Friday, March 5th**.\n",

    "## Rubric\n",
    "Your instructors will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.\n",

    "### Why did we choose this project for you?\n",
    "This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.   \n"
